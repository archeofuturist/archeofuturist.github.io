Like based Stick Man&#039;s weapon of choice. But its a little less effective in extremely close quarter battle. Thats where this comes in handy. Its a shorter single hand melee stick. It can be made of anything, but no less than 1 foot and a half and is at least as thick as a Broom stick. Use tape as a grip. Customize it to do more damage or something. Used at the right time, it can falter all enemy advances. Its a decent blunt melee weapon. <br><br>Now we have the shield. I like those old Roman shields where there like hollow car doors, but you can use a wooden board or a trash can lid. Make sure you can grip the shield from the interior with a band or some thing. Classy points if you paint your shield red with a dollar sign on it. Using a shield is good for a charge, so get some big heavy guys behind the shields and ram the enemy to the curb. +100 Effectiveness if you ram as a group, like the Spartans lining their shields up. If you actually do this, make sure the shield men at the edge of the line charges first so that you can flatten the enemy into the center.","time":1492334152,"resto":121339319,"id":"wyIypEF9","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":121340072,"now":"04\/16\/17(Sun)05:16:30","name":"Anonymous","com":"Basic armor is a helmet, whether an old baseball helmet, a football helmet or a bike helmet. If you have some weird cosplay Spartan helmet or even a real steel helmet, that would work too. If possible, paint MAGA on the back and front for quick identification. Eye armor is sunglasses. They work. Don&#039;t be an antifa fag and cover up your whole face with an ISIS wannabe mask. Just use a bandana and don&#039;t go out there looking like the enemy. Use face armor if needed because Antifa will guaranteed attack you in that region.<br>The simplest counter to those faggy ass face masks is a bucket of sugar water. Its probably hot in that unneeded gear, and they probably get distracted with all that sticky shit on the insides of their masks. Absolute hell. Great for stalling large crowds. One bucket of sugar water will fuck up at least 20 people, and if there was a constant stream barrage of that sticky water, then countering the enemy couldn&#039;t be easier. Use water balloons or water guns. If available, then use paint.

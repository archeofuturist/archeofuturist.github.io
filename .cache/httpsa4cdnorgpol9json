Judge Sparks awarded more than $50,000 in damages to Steve Jackson Games, citing lost profits and violations of the Privacy Protection Act of 1980. In addition, the judge awarded each plaintiff $1,000 under the Electronic Communications Privacy Act for the Secret Service seizure of their stored electronic mail.<br><br>The judge also stated that plaintiffs would be reimbursed for their attorneys&#039; fees.<br><br>The results of this precedent-setting litigation will clearly have important consequences for users of computer bulletin board systems. And, hopefully, the public reprimand of the United States Secret Service will cause them to step back and think before seizing their next BBS.","filename":"O-SD1990","ext":".jpg","w":1600,"h":1600,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":250,"tim":1491459140183,"time":1491459140,"md5":"+HoQAaGvhvC40P\/Z0zelBQ==","fsize":692169,"resto":0,"id":"ioPCaBz1","country":"US","m_img":1,"bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"the-911-file-was-not-what-you-think","country_name":"United States","replies":8,"images":8,"omitted_posts":3,"omitted_images":3},{"no":119713924,"now":"04\/06\/17(Thu)02:17:01","name":"Anonymous","filename":"IMG_20170402_180102","ext":".jpg","w":1564,"h":1564,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":125,"tim":1491459421122,"time":1491459421,"md5":"3DCQzeVKut3MEf0evbEC5w==","fsize":1118841,"resto":119713601,"id":"ioPCaBz1","country":"US","m_img":1,"country_name":"United States"},{"no":119713951,"now":"04\/06\/17(Thu)02:17:19","name":"Anonymous","filename":"20170401_074306","ext":".jpg","w":680,"h":440,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":80,"tim":1491459439839,"time":1491459439,"md5":"CE\/MvBuMJvJvYK1wW6egew==","fsize":180764,"resto":119713601,"id":"ioPCaBz1","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":119714006,"now":"04\/06\/17(Thu)02:18:10","name":"Anonymous","filename":"20170401_074444","ext":".jpg","w":1024,"h":680,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":83,"tim":1491459490992,"time":1491459490,"md5":"YrY8Z8T1rM938TJ15r5o2g==","fsize":452551,"resto":119713601,"id":"ioPCaBz1","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":119714084,"now":"04\/06\/17(Thu)02:19:29","name":"Anonymous","filename":"IMG_20170405_211550","ext":".jpg","w":1564,"h":1564,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":125,"tim":1491459569831,"time":1491459569,"md5":"itY10KUKgO0jXP7eKCiVGw==","fsize":1047868,"resto":119713601,"id":"ioPCaBz1","country":"US","m_img":1,"country_name":"United States"},{"no":119714195,"now":"04\/06\/17(Thu)02:21:25","name":"Anonymous","filename":"IMG_20170405_212910","ext":".jpg","w":1564,"h":1564,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":125,"tim":1491459685520,"time":1491459685,"md5":"BaAZcQ9I5QeqBqNgKPxINw==","fsize":850963,"resto":119713601,"id":"ioPCaBz1","country":"US","m_img":1,"country_name":"United States"}]},{"posts":[{"no":119713483,"now":"04\/06\/17(Thu)02:10:51","name":"Anonymous","com":"FUCK RICHARD SPENCER <br><br>FUCK PUTIN<br><br>FUCK ASSAD<br><br>FUCK BANNON<br><br>https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=2pO<wbr>MCmVc3wY","filename":"jewish-mad","ext":".jpg","w":959,"h":658,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":171,"tim":1491459051189,"time":1491459051,"md5":"LOyTTb5Mk+nP7eSS66EbVA==","fsize":185107,"resto":0,"id":"abmyTNbN","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"fuck-richard-spencer","country_name":"United States","replies":0,"images":0}]},{"posts":[{"no":119708915,"now":"04\/06\/17(Thu)01:15:47","name":"Anonymous","com":"<span class=\"quote\">&gt;just get over it <\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;we had nothing to do with it<\/span>","filename":"slaves","ext":".jpg","w":600,"h":591,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":246,"tim":1491455747693,"time":1491455747,"md5":"KEhVgQWvxuR5AH+S9elJhQ==","fsize":72998,"resto":0,"id":"gg\/xexEw","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"just-get-over-it","country_name":"United States","replies":32,"images":4,"omitted_posts":27,"omitted_images":2},{"no":119712362,"now":"04\/06\/17(Thu)01:55:38","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119708915\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119708915<\/a><br>Never Get Forget Over It?","time":1491458138,"resto":119708915,"id":"j1M2+Pty","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":119712409,"now":"04\/06\/17(Thu)01:56:27","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119708915\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119708915<\/a><br>isn&#039;t that picture on the right fake? that guy has a rare disease","time":1491458187,"resto":119708915,"id":"5dvlaff9","country":"CA","country_name":"Canada"},{"no":119712426,"now":"04\/06\/17(Thu)01:56:40","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119708915\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119708915<\/a><br>the jews did both","time":1491458200,"resto":119708915,"id":"lC\/KMGpf","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":119712459,"now":"04\/06\/17(Thu)01:57:08","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119710160\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119710160<\/a><br>Funny how the chink immigrants who lived through Mao are all now doctors and engineers while you are still smoking crack and pimping out your sisters.

This CBD extract-based medication has yielded positive results in clinical trials with children suffering from forms of epilepsy such as Dravet Syndrome and Lennox-Gastaut Syndrome.<br>Now, the CBD extract is currently being considered for approval as a medication by the Food and Drug Administration, which would pave the path for doctors to prescribe it.<br>To legally approve a medicine, the FDA must have specific information on what it contains and in what specific doses. The FDA could thus never approve the whole marijuana plant as a medicine because there are many different combinations of chemicals in different concentrations from strain to strain, plant to plant, and even from one part of the same plant to another. However, a pure CBD extract that could be dosed in a standardized manner would be a different matter, and there is no barrier to the FDA going forward.<br><br>Assuming the FDA approves CBD extract as a medicine, the Drug Enforcement Administration would then have to agree to remove CBD from Schedule I of the Controlled Substances Act, which is where it now sits by virtue of being part of an illegal drug with no officially recognized medical use (marijuana). Would the DEA really consent to scheduling as a legitimate medicine an extract of a plant they have spent decades battling?","filename":"weedman2","ext":".jpg","w":553,"h":310,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":140,"tim":1491458900103,"time":1491458900,"md5":"3zxoZZmDDVHlC\/orXV4y8Q==","fsize":21747,"resto":0,"id":"eSuv8oyo","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"is-cbd-a-meme","country_name":"United States","replies":0,"images":0}]},{"posts":[{"no":119711319,"now":"04\/06\/17(Thu)01:43:11","name":"Anonymous","sub":"Not looking good for Don","com":"Just ~40% of the U.S. approves of Trump&#039;s post-truth presidency and his ratings are steadily declining.<br><br>It looks like more and more right wingers are abandoning alternative facts and acknowledging Trumps incompetence.<br><br>Source: http:\/\/www.gallup.com\/poll\/203198\/p<wbr>residential-approval-ratings-donald<wbr>-trump.aspx","filename":"sad-cheeto","ext":".jpg","w":650,"h":366,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":140,"tim":1491457391401,"time":1491457391,"md5":"5hMLrXvreRxkoOrOM0bttQ==","fsize":23051,"resto":0,"id":"5dDqhAmw","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"not-looking-good-for-don","country_name":"United States","replies":7,"images":3,"omitted_posts":2,"omitted_images":1},{"no":119711693,"now":"04\/06\/17(Thu)01:47:34","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119711433\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119711433<\/a><br>Trump will follow the orders of his leader Bannon.","time":1491457654,"resto":119711319,"id":"5dDqhAmw","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":119711731,"now":"04\/06\/17(Thu)01:48:01","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119711319\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119711319<\/a><br><br>I think he is doing pretty good considering the whole world is out to get him<br><br>Obama&#039;s first 100 days were rocky as well and he had everyone rooting for him.","time":1491457681,"resto":119711319,"id":"AP1bWSqQ","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":119711917,"now":"04\/06\/17(Thu)01:50:22","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119711319\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119711319<\/a><br>Working late night is not going to guarentee you fucking double.

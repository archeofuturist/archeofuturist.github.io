The reasons for the antidemocratic urge within society are diverse, the most important I would say is human nature itself, since all democracies are in need of constant educational and pedagogical programs to form up a society of &quot;democratic citizens&quot; because every human being &quot;by nature&quot; simply isnt democratic but quite the opposite. <br><br>A dictatorship is a system that every human being understands right away, while a democratic system first needs to be taught and learned; its more abstract and thus less natural.

Women had no political rights in pre-Revolutionary France; they were considered &quot;passive&quot; citizens; forced to rely on men to determine what was best for them. That changed dramatically in theory as there seemingly were great advances in feminism. Feminism emerged in Paris as part of a broad demand for social and political reform. The women demanded equality to men and then moved on to a demand for the end of male domination&quot;<br>&quot;Most of these outwardly activist women were punished for their militancy. The kind of punishment received during the Revolution included public denouncement, arrest, execution, or exile. Th\u00e9roigne de M\u00e9ricourt was arrested, publicly flogged and then spent the rest of her life sentenced to an insane asylum. Pauline L\u00e9on and Claire Lacombe were arrested, later released, and continued to receive ridicule and abuse for their activism.

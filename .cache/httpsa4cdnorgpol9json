Then i saw it: a severed hand, torn straight from the arm of some red cunt. At this point, i decided i&#039;d do something interesting with it. You see, i had a small chili plant i kept on my windowsill that i felt hadn&#039;t received any type of nutrition for a long time, and seeing how worthless communists inherently are, i decided it was time that one of them was given a purpose in life. I wrapped the hand in some tissues, and when i got home, i lifted the pepper with all the dirt out of the pot and placed the hand at the bottom. to this day, those are the damn best tasting peppers ive ever had.","filename":"get the bat","ext":".jpg","w":196,"h":268,"tn_w":91,"tn_h":125,"tim":1491953858032,"time":1491953858,"md5":"Que5vwrQsXuvoW+Gs+VIFA==","fsize":12432,"resto":120671500,"id":"mOJDdXpK","country":"US","country_name":"United States"}]},{"posts":[{"no":120672615,"now":"04\/11\/17(Tue)18:57:41","name":"Anonymous","com":"What the fuck is so amazing about this sandy shithole that it&#039;s worth 2,000+ years of war?","filename":"1478772955787[1]","ext":".jpg","w":1000,"h":647,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":161,"tim":1491951461265,"time":1491951461,"md5":"PT76WCoZtrWWrMpf7LtVLQ==","fsize":281057,"resto":0,"id":"8AEPa6bI","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"what-the-fuck-is-so-amazing-about-this-sandy","country_name":"United States","replies":21,"images":1,"omitted_posts":16,"omitted_images":1},{"no":120675662,"now":"04\/11\/17(Tue)19:20:19","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120675322\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120675322<\/a><br>Everyone is a slave to the state, but your children or maybe your grandchildren will have the pleasure of plowing the fields for the Jew.","time":1491952819,"resto":120672615,"id":"U+u9XAkC","country":"CA","country_name":"Canada"},{"no":120676304,"now":"04\/11\/17(Tue)19:25:20","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120672615\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120672615<\/a><br>1- it is the most strategic region of the world from the logistic point of view (land bridge between 3 continent, Suez channel, Hormuz strait + other major commercial see and land highways and bottle necks)<br><br>2- it has the almost 70% of the worlds easy oil and gas (shove a hose into the ground and pump)<br><br>3- It has the easiest place to have a puppet government (makes CIA people hard just by read the word &quot;puppet government&quot;)<br><br>4- it has more young population than anywhere else (I&#039;m talking about almost human...

Sexuality is the biggest Jewish lie ever conceived only meant to deceive people and bring them towards deviancy. If you put a self proclaimed homosexual in a room with a really horny girl, you bet they&#039;re gonna fuck and have those kids. Homosexuals just want an easier way to have sex, any why are most homosexual feminine role-players? Because they desire easy access to sex (men being the easiest to seduce) and want to simulate what they truly want. Women.It&#039; all about cum, there is no love, just lust. When they go into relationships, it&#039;s not about love, only lust. Easy sex. Not real attraction, it&#039;s all about a fetish of dick- not sexuality itself<br>Sexuality is the biggest lie ever to bring fetishes of the most deviant to open society<br>The only sexuality there is, is heterosexuality.

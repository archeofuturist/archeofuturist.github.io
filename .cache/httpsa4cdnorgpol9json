And it&#039;s certainly healthy not to drink at all. But this hysteria about it kinda gets on my nerves and I think it&#039;s not healthy. Because if you really convince yourself that it&#039;s true, it will be certainly true once you drink something by accident. <br><br>I have seen people like this who where absolutely strict for years and then one day said fuck it and went straight back and binged out for one or two weeks loosing their job in the process and all.

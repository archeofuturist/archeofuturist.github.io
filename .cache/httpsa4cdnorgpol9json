Can we expect them to embrace? International community could realistically be prompted to act with minimal grudging support from China, but I imagine they&#039;d want to be as involved as possible to set up back-room deals with the new administration (I doubt reunification will be on the table). And the question of our debt that they hold is still valid, what can they actually do with it? I know that they&#039;ve converted some to gold, but they&#039;re still a pretty big holder.

And many rational conservatives\/undecideds are frightened by conservative politicians who are very well-adapted to offense, while a fringe liberal &quot;just really cares about everybody even if they&#039;re misguided&quot;. Everybody hates taxes, but they forget that the more government services provide, the more must be required in taxes. Democrats fake getting around this all the time by fudging the budget office reports and marking plans (like Obamacare) as &quot;revenue neutral&quot;. I think a lot of these problems are exacerbated by the two-party system, if the freedom caucus was a third party that was just closely allied with the Republicans, they could more effectively express their viewpoints. And maybe if we had some splintered Democrat parties they&#039;d be held accountable more so that the various factions could hold more sway.

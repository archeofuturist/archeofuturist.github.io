It&#039;s like gay sex is all they think or talk about.","filename":"CWUE3yl","ext":".jpg","w":1420,"h":1922,"tn_w":184,"tn_h":249,"tim":1492027256186,"time":1492027256,"md5":"phzgsLbKw2KIDnztncG7uw==","fsize":273683,"resto":0,"id":"1Soo\/7b8","country":"US","m_img":1,"bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"why-is-the-alt-right-so-fascinated-with","country_name":"United States","replies":60,"images":13,"omitted_posts":55,"omitted_images":12},{"no":120811016,"now":"04\/12\/17(Wed)17:20:48","name":"Anonymous","com":"Join the OFFICIAL \/polgb\/ Discord:<br><br>https:\/\/discord.gg\/Qr4ez","filename":"polgbt10","ext":".jpg","w":1178,"h":1014,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":107,"tim":1492032048197,"time":1492032048,"md5":"y6xgwi7nAsBiCZ\/K\/6LP4Q==","fsize":223018,"resto":120799706,"id":"ZChngKL0","country":"US","m_img":1,"country_name":"United States"},{"no":120811146,"now":"04\/12\/17(Wed)17:21:38","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120810348\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120810348<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Civil unions existed<\/span><br>Tbf,i do think that this whole LBGTQQMOARBTFO+:; movement is becoming feminism vol.2,basically already fulfilled its purpose but insane women are using it to push for as much shit as they can.Women,not even once.","time":1492032098,"resto":120799706,"id":"m7he1\/I9","country":"GR","country_name":"Greece"},{"no":120811634,"now":"04\/12\/17(Wed)17:24:53","name":"Anonymous","com":"post the rest of the comics or my digits reek havoc upon you all","time":1492032293,"resto":120799706,"id":"V603OGK8","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":120811928,"now":"04\/12\/17(Wed)17:27:01","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120799706\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120799706<\/a><br>Back to your containment board you sick freak.

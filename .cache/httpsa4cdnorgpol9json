Their very presence taints the heroic image of anti-Zionist activism in the eyes of non-racist newcomers, perverts its purpose in the eyes of racist newcomers, and impedes every effort for unifying all non-Jews against Jewish domination. Clear-thinking anti-Zionists correctly identified WNs long ago as useful idiots led by Zionist agents to forment interethnic tension. As Aryanists, we moreover emphasize how WNs themselves have proven no different from present-day Israelis in their way of thinking (which many WNs themselves even admit). Either way, they have no place within any serious anti-Zionist movement, but should be considered part of the enemy in the broader anti-tribalist movement that we have proposed, for by their ethnocentrism they have already rejected our motto of UNITY THROUGH NOBILITY.<br><br>(* Obviously WNs are not \u2013 despite the name they give themselves \u2013 nationalistic in any serious sense, as their allegiance is not to any country but rather to the international \u201cwhite\u201d diaspora, much like how Jews\u2019 allegiance is to the international Jewish diaspora. The quickest way to disprove WN claims to nationalism is to ask them whether or not they would prioritize a \u201cnon-white\u201d person from their own country over a \u201cwhite\u201d person from another country. What WNs mean by their crude abuse of the term is that they want countries where only \u201cwhite\u201d people are allowed to live, just as Jews have Israel.)","filename":"1491086701070","ext":".jpg","w":960,"h":960,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":250,"tim":1492561206914,"time":1492561206,"md5":"sLJ8lnNB4QRidMOFBIB+Rw==","fsize":308099,"resto":0,"id":"DsUyfoEB","country":"LT","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"an-anon-posted-this-in-another-thread-and-it-was","country_name":"Lithuania","replies":52,"images":5,"omitted_posts":47,"omitted_images":5},{"no":121777589,"now":"04\/18\/17(Tue)21:24:13","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121770129\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121770129<\/a><br>IQ measures intellect, not intelligence.

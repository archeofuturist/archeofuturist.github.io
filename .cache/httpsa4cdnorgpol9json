The contemporary dispute over violence and non-violence in 1960s American politics is said to be irredeemably mired in \u201cideological rhetoric\u201d designed to either halt, slow or hasten change in the existing distribution of power and privilege \u2014 depending on the class position of the observer. Established financial and political interests identify violence squarely as illegal and condemns all challenges to the authority of the state and property rights. Middle-class liberals encourage some illegal dissent and disruption (rent strikes, sit-ins), but only so long as it does not challenge the economic social arrangements on which their success is based. For reactionary white working- class constituencies, \u201cviolence\u201d is any threat from the outclass \u2014 street crime, ghetto riots and civil rights marches. For the Black outclass and its sympathisers within the liberal wing, the application of \u201cviolence\u201d is typically reversed to the police not rioters, employers not strikers etc. \u2014 \u201cthe outclass naturally seeks to legitimise the riots, harrassments, and street crime which are its only weapons. Equally naturally, the rest of society labels such means \u2018violent\u2019 and suppresses them\u201d.<br>Uri Gordon, Anarchism and Political Theory: Contemporary Problems","time":1492983357,"resto":122491854,"id":"F7TvXm1g","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":122492223,"now":"04\/23\/17(Sun)17:37:25","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122491854\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122491854<\/a><br>Have a nice day","filename":"die philosophie der macht","ext":".jpg","w":340,"h":510,"tn_w":83,"tn_h":125,"tim":1492983445661,"time":1492983445,"md5":"KTpO2nhYTeWSe6cdNx6gHg==","fsize":81558,"resto":122491854,"id":"IZPpUiDn","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":122492566,"now":"04\/23\/17(Sun)17:39:39","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122491854\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122491854<\/a><br>*in no way","filename":"tumblr_oor9giQYiM1r1i9k6o1_400","ext":".jpg","w":320,"h":490,"tn_w":81,"tn_h":125,"tim":1492983579318,"time":1492983579,"md5":"gro786l2WfKIem+amA2yBg==","fsize":175674,"resto":122491854,"id":"F7TvXm1g","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":122492935,"now":"04\/23\/17(Sun)17:42:10","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122492223\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122492223<\/a><br>See:<br><a href=\"#p122492566\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122492566<\/a>","filename":"tumblr_oihey1uvIZ1ttrxmxo1_500","ext":".jpg","w":500,"h":667,"tn_w":93,"tn_h":124,"tim":1492983730343,"time":1492983730,"md5":"4NRroCNqnDOQ6\/re0RQXgA==","fsize":156138,"resto":122491854,"id":"F7TvXm1g","country":"US","country_name":"United States"}]},{"posts":[{"no":122492202,"now":"04\/23\/17(Sun)17:37:16","name":"Anonymous","sub":"Didn&#039;t the US say the attack on Raqqa comes on April 1?","com":"Did the US mean April 1, 2019?","filename":"3d printed dog kurds","ext":".png","w":1368,"h":860,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":157,"tim":1492983436620,"time":1492983436,"md5":"23ieEy0+OIpnGBEf64xXog==","fsize":438294,"resto":0,"id":"M0dylfhR","country":"DE","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"didnt-the-us-say-the-attack-on-raqqa-comes-on","country_name":"Germany","replies":0,"images":0}]},{"posts":[{"no":122483569,"now":"04\/23\/17(Sun)16:41:01","name":"Anonymous","com":"Ask a pakistani anything.<br><br>Serious questions appreciated.","filename":"pepe","ext":".png","w":470,"h":384,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":204,"tim":1492980061678,"time":1492980061,"md5":"lfmTXAjT8yWkH61qEnd4sw==","fsize":193223,"resto":0,"id":"xUtpRvpd","country":"PK","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"ask-a-pakistani-anything","country_name":"Pakistan","replies":53,"images":4,"omitted_posts":48,"omitted_images":4},{"no":122489463,"now":"04\/23\/17(Sun)17:19:30","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122487300\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122487300<\/a><br>Oh shit hol up","time":1492982370,"resto":122483569,"id":"kyDFTXva","country":"PT","country_name":"Portugal"},{"no":122490734,"now":"04\/23\/17(Sun)17:27:35","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122489463\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122489463<\/a><br>What happen?","time":1492982855,"resto":122483569,"id":"xUtpRvpd","country":"PK","country_name":"Pakistan"},{"no":122491308,"now":"04\/23\/17(Sun)17:31:29","name":"Anonymous","com":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/List_<wbr>of_countries_by_suicide_rate<br><br>Suicide rate in Pakistan is one of the lowest in the world according to that list.

This will be the new normal and any women that is less than will be less tolerated. The smart women will get the picture and start to fall in line. There may even be women that will share a bed with a robot and their man. The women who don&#039;t get it will be polarized the other way towards Tumblr tier shit and eventually chimpout. They will be cracked down on. Eventually they&#039;ll try to make their own safespace lebensraum\/economy without men. It&#039;ll fail hilariously but by this point male society will be doing so well they&#039;ll actually send them monetary aid and skilled workers to maintain it. The huddled impoverished women in these societies will be throwing themselves at their male saviors but the men will be disgusted by them. Real women refugees will start getting augmentations to become more robotlike. Not just in appearance but they will willing take medication to make them all around more pleasant to be around and to supress their shitty behaviour. <br><br>The artificial womb research might now actually find ways to genetically breed perfect flesh and blood waifus with perfect temperaments. Man will have succeed where God failed in creating a companion to share the world with him from his own flesh. This woman will be perfect and not doom humanity with her corrupted nature. No more wars will be fought for petrochemicals to make the endless cycles of disposable women&#039;s fashion to flatter them. We will no longer have a consumption based economy that favors women&#039;s propensity towards consumption. Men will no longer develop themselves in pointless ways and sabotage humanity like the peacock that lost it&#039;s ability to fly to create a spectacle for women. Men will no longer have to compete for more wealth or status than they ever need. All men will be brothers. All women that came before this upheaval will be referred to as &quot;Lilith&quot; and all women after will be reffered to as eve.","filename":"vivnita jameskeesian","ext":".png","w":660,"h":438,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":82,"tim":1492982752252,"time":1492982752,"md5":"qt9ZICSp92udoZNtGetXCA==","fsize":498378,"resto":122466952,"id":"4soZDwtU","country":"AU","country_name":"Australia"},{"no":122490492,"now":"04\/23\/17(Sun)17:26:03","name":"Anonymous","com":"Silicon with ferrofluid then nanomagnets to control it? possible?<br><br>Ferrofluid,<br>https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=vsQ<wbr>h1AT6qUE","time":1492982763,"resto":122466952,"id":"7K9SpTpn","country":"SE","country_name":"Sweden"},{"no":122491575,"now":"04\/23\/17(Sun)17:33:08","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122472855\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122472855<\/a><br>The sonic ceramic, the toy truck, the little girl sheets and socks, the twirling.

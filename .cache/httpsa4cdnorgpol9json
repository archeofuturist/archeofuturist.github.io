Places like Australia, Canada, and the US have a &quot;white&quot; ethnic group that is composed of different europeans. I am sympathetic to preserving these demographics through restricted immigration and increasing the white birthrate, but not through ethnic cleansing.

Africans, Arabs, Iranians, and Pakistan, Bangladesh, Malaysia and Indonesia have many characteristics in common with each other, though I think other cultural factors make Bangladeah, Malaysia and Indonesia much less of a shithole. <br><br>Anyway its worth co-operating with other cultures to stop islam, and we can&#039;t do that if we are completely ethnocentric, we can do it a little bit though, but no killing. <br><br><a href=\"#p120328190\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120328190<\/a><br><br>I want equality of opportunity, not outcome.

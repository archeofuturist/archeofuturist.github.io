Sure, as an evolutionary scientist, you don&#039;t predict future, but you can predict all kinds of things about what will be discovered from the past and present.<br><br>For example:<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;It was predicted that humans must have an intermaxillary bone, since other mammals do. The adult human skull consists of bones that have fused together, so you can&#039;t tell one way or the other in an adult. An examination of human embryonic development showed that an intermaxillary bone is one of the things that fuses to become your upper jaw.<\/span><br>This example is from here:<br>http:\/\/answersinscience.org\/evo_sci<wbr>ence.html<br><br>It&#039;s true that sometimes evolutionists fail with their predictions and later correct themselves with other explanations. But the same has been true with various physics theories as well, it&#039;s not inherently unscientific. Sure, evolution is a more tricky theory than most, but the mountain of good predictions and huge explanations is huge.<br><br>Think of this example. I give you a sequence of numbers. In this sequence, every number is actually chosen randomly from a certain distribution of probabilities. You can, after a while, realize that the sequence is random, but with some numbers more likely than others. You can start describing the distribution of probabilities, but you will never be able to predict an upcoming number with certainty. Does this mean that your theory about the sequence is unscientific? Not really.<br><br>I would highly recommend reading Dawkins&#039; &quot;The Selfish Gene&quot;. Whatever you may think about his anti-religion bullshit, this book is a really, really good explanation of the evolution theory, and it&#039;s highly fascinating. If you don&#039;t buy the theory even after reading that book with open mind, ok, sure, you can say that you are a learned evolution denier.

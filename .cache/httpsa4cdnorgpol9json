Why, of all the different tragedies throughout the history of man, does the whole world care and focus so greatly on the suffering of the Jews? Why not the suffering of many other nations, and peoples. even of present day? <br>Secondly, why demonize Hitler over so many other evil blooded men of history? Why not also associate &quot;Satan incarnate&quot; with other leaders who also attempted world domination? How about &quot;Alexander the Great&quot;- How is he crowned the titile: &quot;The Great&quot; when he was slaughtering nations out of a psychotically driving desire to control the entire world? How is it he goes down in history as &quot;a military genius&quot;? Makes you wonder from whose perspective history is written, eh?<br>2. TO CHRISTIAN READERS: If the Jews are &quot;God&#039;s chosen people&quot;, then why does the world LOVE and PROTECT them? Because God says in John 15:19 &quot; If you were of the world, the world would love its own. Yet because you are not of the world, but I chose you out of the world, therefore the world hates you.&quot; So then, why are they protected legally, by the World&#039;s leading government? Where is their persecution? Something else to make you go &quot;Hmm...&quot;.<br>3. Why did Hitler target the Jews? If he truly was after creating an &quot;Aryan Race&quot; (Perfect White Folks) Why not target those races with darkest skin first? Yet records show he actually band together with muslims and blacks of his day to fight the war. That leads me to think it wasn&#039;t about race, but something about the culture (actions) of the Jews themselves he dispised.<br><br>Now I&#039;m just reading historical documents and these are the rising thoughts. Hitler may be of the devil, but I can&#039;t see how the Jews are of God (Jehovah).","filename":"attic","ext":".jpg","w":421,"h":640,"tn_w":164,"tn_h":250,"tim":1493830077558,"time":1493830077,"md5":"9CnPxFyv3KcS6\/fOkZcrwA==","fsize":47073,"resto":0,"id":"S1eUwZvE","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"need-your-help-pol","country_name":"United States","replies":0,"images":0}]},{"posts":[{"no":123931616,"now":"05\/03\/17(Wed)12:47:47","name":"Anonymous","com":"Isn&#039;t pic related just a meme created by you know that to make us accept better totalitarian ideas thus halfway to reach a global communist dictatorship???","filename":"bandeira-nazista_sm","ext":".png","w":250,"h":150,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":150,"tim":1493830067860,"time":1493830067,"md5":"VAkCXSfEKPKWgBxh5MduVg==","fsize":4327,"resto":0,"id":"w\/I0Z0oz","country":"BR","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"isnt-pic-related-just-a-meme-created-by-you-know","country_name":"Brazil","replies":0,"images":0}]},{"posts":[{"no":123911121,"now":"05\/03\/17(Wed)09:18:09","name":"Anonymous","sub":"European Union Member States only thread","com":"There is no greater feeling than knowing that are an EUropean.","filename":"European Union","ext":".jpg","w":875,"h":744,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":212,"tim":1493817489231,"time":1493817489,"md5":"lFZz1bi8OFdL4S3EFo\/ODw==","fsize":172876,"resto":0,"id":"+Mx\/lb4E","country":"DE","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"european-union-member-states-only-thread","country_name":"Germany","replies":236,"images":62,"omitted_posts":231,"omitted_images":62,"tail_size":50},{"no":123928755,"now":"05\/03\/17(Wed)12:20:43","name":"Anonymous","com":"Yo kidding me?

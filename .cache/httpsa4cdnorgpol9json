Time will tell if Trump actually goes along with their plan.<br><br>How do you defeat your enemies very effectively? You divide them and compel them to extinguish each other. Then you take the spoils and land.<br><br>This is what they&#039;ve done throughout history, they are now doing it in the US. <br><br>This does NOT mean that you have to like Muslims or atheists or Christians, all that it means is that you should be aware of the real enemy capitalizing on our animosity -- the state of Israel. <br><br>The State of Israel, along with Saudi Arabia to a large extent, is the central hub of human trafficking and pedophilia. They make more than $100 billion each year just for sex trafficking. <br><br>It is not the countries and people there per se, but the heads of finance, industry and State. <br><br>Yes, they are initiating psychological demoralization and degeneracy campaigns on the population, via Hollywood film production companies and university systems. They have been doing it since the 60s but are increasing it more than ever now. <br><br>Why? Because Islam and Western traditional values both pose a threat to them.<br><br>This is not mere speculation but an evidential assessment of the known data, combined with what we already know about history. <br><br>I am not here to recommend a strategy -- though if I were pressed, I&#039;d say first take care of Israel, since they are the source of radical Islamic terrorism, and then push for nationalism -- but just be aware that Israel is behind much of what we see happening.<br><br>Also, expect terrorist attacks to go biological at some point in the near future. Groups like antifa are not just college students -- there will align with terror cells and resort to bombing.

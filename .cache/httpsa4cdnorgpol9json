Especially nowaddays.<br><br>FinaIly, with the protection of the state, we can assume our role as the dominant gender. We can beat the shit out of our husbands, emotionally torment them, even cheat on them and there is nothing they can do about it and ugly men will never have a chance to even be with us.<br><br>For example, my husband filed for divorce a little over a year ago when he discovered I was cheating on him. I wasn&#039;t even ashamed when he walked in on me fucking another man, because I was sick of him and his bullshit inability to satisfy me sexually. I continued to sleep with my black lover for weeks after he found out, sometimes even while my husband was home. He had to listen to us fucking and me getting pleased by a superior massive black cock while he slept on the couch. He eventually lost it and smacked me, giving me just the justification I needed to press assault charges and file for a restraining order. Under advice of legal counsel, I cleaned out our joint checking account and froze it and froze our credit cards while he was in jail, to prevent him from being able to afford to hire a competent lawyer.<br><br>Yesterday, I was awarded full ownership of the house, custody of the children he doesn&#039;t even realize aren&#039;t his, 1,450 dollars a month in child support, 3,725 dollars a month in alimony and basically suffered no consequence for being unfaithful. All this for being willing and able to take a smack across the face :)<br><br>He whined like a litle bich to the judge, claiming he had to get a roommate now, because he can&#039;t afford to rent an apartment by himself and pay me what he owes me. So pathetic.","filename":"1492553448231","ext":".jpg","w":893,"h":1200,"tn_w":186,"tn_h":250,"tim":1492736725830,"time":1492736725,"md5":"cMCwjkgCKLwFxFgXh88WAw==","fsize":133616,"resto":0,"id":"FiKDCkat","country":"US","m_img":1,"bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"l-love-being-a-woman-especially-nowaddays","country_name":"United States","replies":34,"images":8,"omitted_posts":29,"omitted_images":6},{"no":122076592,"now":"04\/20\/17(Thu)21:32:45","name":"Anonymous","com":"I know this is bait, but I&#039;ve literally seen almost this exact thing happen to 2 of my friends and my cousin .<br><br>It happens constantly all over the west.<br><br>I have no sympathy when I hear about gfs, wives, ex wives being brutally butchered by their men.

So that means a general education would be useless, if a child is just going to have one main profession when they&#039;re adult, so why not immediately start training them for their profession to not waste time? Also this division of labor would apply to the government as well. I don&#039;t think every doctor or coal miner has the skills needed to become a leader of a nation, so why would they vote for one if they couldn&#039;t even do the job well? The person in charge shouldn&#039;t be elected, but trained as a professional for their job in managing the country. Now the idea with subsistence pay and very hard work from everyone is towards making a great society. Low consumption and high production of industries will leave the nation with a high surplus and in a well off state to support its rapidly growing population.","time":1493007141,"resto":122529914,"id":"Szz4pr8W","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":122542241,"now":"04\/24\/17(Mon)00:28:08","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122529914\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122529914<\/a><br>stop posting on pol and go pilot a fucking Eva bitch","filename":"1486380466032","ext":".jpg","w":301,"h":377,"tn_w":99,"tn_h":125,"tim":1493008088685,"time":1493008088,"md5":"7eYdRm\/07tu81B0ipQi4xA==","fsize":28761,"resto":122529914,"id":"u9iTvI66","country":"AU","country_name":"Australia"},{"no":122543078,"now":"04\/24\/17(Mon)00:36:05","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122542241\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122542241<\/a><br>no","time":1493008565,"resto":122529914,"id":"Szz4pr8W","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":122544248,"now":"04\/24\/17(Mon)00:47:14","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122529914\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122529914<\/a><br>stop making me hard","time":1493009234,"resto":122529914,"id":"LWhJv7z4","country":"SE","country_name":"Sweden"}]},{"posts":[{"no":122544225,"now":"04\/24\/17(Mon)00:47:05","name":"Anonymous","sub":"be honest","com":"did you fall for this?","filename":"1492933422581","ext":".jpg","w":838,"h":771,"tn_w":249,"tn_h":230,"tim":1493009225872,"time":1493009225,"md5":"xoXuaFW5o5YwjbPhyNAIzg==","fsize":190024,"resto":0,"id":"q5YQWm99","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"be-honest","country_name":"United States","replies":1,"images":0},{"no":122545414,"now":"04\/24\/17(Mon)00:58:52","name":"Sage","com":"<a href=\"#p122544225\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122544225<\/a><br>Holy shit stop making these threads you autist.

What happened was he reversed a quarter percentage point cut to mortgage insurance rates that was yet to go into effect. There&#039;s two things to note here:<br>1. It hadn&#039;t even gone into effect yet. So there&#039;s no net increase on first time home buyer costs. They keep paying what they&#039;re paying now.<br><br>2. This isn&#039;t affecting mortgage premiums. It&#039;s about mortgage insurance premiums. Mortgage issuers require mortgage insurance for risky loans: people with low income, people with low credit scores, people asking for loans that represent more than they can reasonably afford. Keeping the cost of mortgage insurance premiums high is a good thing. Hell, if anything they should be increased even more. Maybe then people will think twice before going for the unaffordable mortgage. This reduces the default rate on mortgages.<br><br>So in effect, it&#039;s a commitment not to reduce the idiot insurance. It will remain costly to be an idiot.

Pinochet was one of the biggest pieces of shit to ever rule a country in general, much less only in Chile. I mean really, he let the openly neoliberal &quot;Chicago Boys&quot; shape his economic policies, he killed tons of Spaniards\/Basques\/Italians\/Germans etc for no good reason, he bowed down to America&#039;s every wish, and he was pro-Israeli\/Zionist. How in the fuck is that even remotely nationalist? Actual nationalist leaders who gave a fuck about their people such as Peron, Vargas, Allende, Chavez, etc protected their nations&#039; economy against &quot;foreign&quot; (aka &#039;murrican) investments. Pinochet basically turned Chile into an American protectorate.

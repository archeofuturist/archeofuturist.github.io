One thing I have to admit I never really connected to is the idea of charity or service -- NOT because I lack empathy, but rather because it seemed almost strange to me to focus on, say, feeding a homeless person, when there are all these other problems that are &quot;closer&quot; to me that need fixing -- helping the people in my own life with their struggles, illnesses, grief, etc., being a better person for my family, and that sort of thing. It almost seemed arbitrary to think of going out and putting my energy toward a problem removed from my own life when there&#039;s always so much &quot;at home&quot; that needs that kind of care. <br><br>Today, however, it struck me in a new way. As I look at the world around me, I can&#039;t help but feel that humanity is an unsolvable problem. I&#039;m sure I don&#039;t need to elaborate on what I mean by that. So I&#039;m suddenly seeing this call to service as an answer to that. It&#039;s unsolvable at the macro level, but as an individual, I can spread truth, mercy, and grace wherever I go, and there is no place that doesn&#039;t need those things, and that is what saves us, in a way, because the world will never be &quot;saved&quot; in the way we want it to be.<br><br>I&#039;d be curious to hear what other Christians think.

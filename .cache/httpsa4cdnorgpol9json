Is that to be the future of Europe? And is this competition to be organised within our European brotherhood? Bringing in these sweat-fields in Africa into our Europe civilisation, so that the financial power in one European country can use it against the financial power in another? Or the great financial central power of the world, now shifted from the City of London to Wall Street, New York? Shall be able on the mass of money, of wealth and of power which it brings to it? Again and again to exert it&#039;s influence in politics? Until that you see the day, it is childish nonsense to say that a British government rules Britain! Its nothing to do with British government or the British people! <br><br>The government of the world is the financial government! The power of money, and of money alone! &quot;","filename":"swald-mosley-attendsafiery-blackshirt-rally-in-manchester-circa-1938-14297071","ext":".png","w":500,"h":476,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":238,"tim":1492538240712,"time":1492538240,"md5":"V8gOujG9vYv08sXZhoFcuQ==","fsize":126941,"resto":0,"id":"Y3biVY5K","country":"GB","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"like-the-other-poor-devils-in-china-india-and","country_name":"United Kingdom","replies":1,"images":0},{"no":121715593,"now":"04\/18\/17(Tue)14:03:33","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121714830\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121714830<\/a><br>It&#039;s safe to say Mosley was the most red pilled Englishman of 20th century","time":1492538613,"resto":121714830,"id":"aDYbU1yQ","country":"ME","country_name":"Montenegro"}]},{"posts":[{"no":121712683,"now":"04\/18\/17(Tue)13:40:48","name":"Anonymous","sub":"Black Lives Matter","filename":"Adobe Spark (9)","ext":".jpg","w":2560,"h":2560,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":250,"tim":1492537248177,"time":1492537248,"md5":"5swtDN6gxa4vW3g+YXGl2A==","fsize":286758,"resto":0,"id":"wV4zEvwx","country":"CA","m_img":1,"bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"black-lives-matter","country_name":"Canada","replies":6,"images":0,"omitted_posts":1,"omitted_images":0},{"no":121713065,"now":"04\/18\/17(Tue)13:43:16","name":"Anonymous","com":"He was turning his life around.","time":1492537396,"resto":121712683,"id":"7F7Yjg+t","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":121713292,"now":"04\/18\/17(Tue)13:45:03","name":"Anonymous","com":"hewussagoodboy.","time":1492537503,"resto":121712683,"id":"lusVb7lY","country":"CA","country_name":"Canada"},{"no":121713307,"now":"04\/18\/17(Tue)13:45:08","name":"Anonymous","com":"he wuz at that mac donalds looking for a J O B <br>he wuz going on the right path! oh jesus these police be so vengeful, they see a young black man trying to better himself after a innocent mistake and gun him down like a monster","time":1492537508,"resto":121712683,"id":"WqlbtyZr","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":121714708,"now":"04\/18\/17(Tue)13:56:23","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121712683\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121712683<\/a><br>This image can&#039;t be real, can it?","time":1492538183,"resto":121712683,"id":"lMX6OPh0","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":121715534,"now":"04\/18\/17(Tue)14:03:04","name":"SomeTwat","com":"<a href=\"#p121714708\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121714708<\/a><br>&quot;Adobe Spark (9).jpg&quot;","time":1492538584,"resto":121712683,"id":"8ECNxDuc","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"}]},{"posts":[{"no":121715051,"now":"04\/18\/17(Tue)13:59:02","name":"Anonymous","com":"If a country is in outrageous debt to many countries but has all of its income, services and goods destroyed and therefore is unable to pay back its debtors, what happens?","filename":"Zimbabwe_Hyperinflation_2008_notes","ext":".jpg","w":1024,"h":818,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":199,"tim":1492538342558,"time":1492538342,"md5":"9CPxf1KlU+T2KNmrgELKoQ==","fsize":200360,"resto":0,"id":"JvCRHsqY","country":"GB","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"if-a-country-is-in-outrageous-debt-to-many","country_name":"United Kingdom","replies":1,"images":1},{"no":121715509,"now":"04\/18\/17(Tue)14:02:50","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121715051\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121715051<\/a><br>Judging from your picture I think you know","filename":"1453082194909","ext":".gif","w":318,"h":212,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":83,"tim":1492538570619,"time":1492538570,"md5":"qdC+jwAcCT\/idHOEz0pwbw==","fsize":2941016,"resto":121715051,"id":"5WYmUcYZ","country":"US","country_name":"United States"}]},{"posts":[{"no":121714500,"now":"04\/18\/17(Tue)13:54:44","name":"To the Ancapistanis of \/pol\/","com":"I am centre-right.

Christianity though initially having been based on a revelation by God has been thoroughly disproven. The bible is completely unreliable with the originals still unknown to this day. The quran however has been perfectly preserved since the beginning.<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Are Islam&#039;s teachings and \/pol\/&#039;s views compatible?<\/span><br>Yes perfectly. Islam fights any form of degeneracy with an iron fist. No drugs, no alcohol, no feminism. Strong patriarchic family values. The sound of children&#039;s laughter has almost silenced in the west, Islam has the highest birthrate in the world.<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Isn&#039;t it mysogynistic?<\/span><br>No. 3 women convert to Islam for every male convert. Women realise feminism is a false gospel and only when you find your purpose in life you can be truely happy. Yes Islam commands modesty but so did the west for millenia. People know start to realise that&#039;s the norm. It is time that \/pol\/ realises that too. The 4 wives you will have are a bonus.<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Isn&#039;t it anti-nationalistic?<\/span><br>No. Islam commands us to respect all races and cultures and only cut out the blasphemous and degenerate aspects. That&#039;s why Islam in Indonesia differs greatly from say SA Islam. Obviously like christianity the religion itself hass no boundaries by country but it very well respects nations within. Without Islamic birth rates your race and nation will soon go extinct.","filename":"4ec98fe0f739d52bb37740609a96688e01c59cca32d77484352c5aa14beaad91","ext":".png","w":1437,"h":909,"tn_w":249,"tn_h":158,"tim":1493115042471,"time":1493115042,"md5":"Kry9YCndXBZjVEox6seM+w==","fsize":89757,"resto":0,"id":"3iqdDX6B","country":"DE","bumplimit":1,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"islam-general-chemo-edition","country_name":"Germany","replies":311,"images":49,"omitted_posts":306,"omitted_images":48,"tail_size":50},{"no":122741624,"now":"04\/25\/17(Tue)10:54:31","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122741290\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122741290<\/a><br>Do you realize your prophet was told to consult the people of the book (jews) if he was unsure about a verse?","time":1493132071,"resto":122718937,"id":"J9VFdlh2","country":"CA","country_name":"Canada"},{"no":122741869,"now":"04\/25\/17(Tue)10:56:47","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122741019\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122741019<\/a><br>Doesn&#039;t help when the RoE and government assigned oversight forces the military to release military prisoners.","time":1493132207,"resto":122718937,"id":"XJdZpAxE","country":"CA","country_name":"Canada"},{"no":122742059,"now":"04\/25\/17(Tue)10:58:30","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122741624\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122741624<\/a><br>Fun fact: 90% of Muslims in the world are illiterate.","time":1493132310,"resto":122718937,"id":"f2cnjSVG","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":122742110,"now":"04\/25\/17(Tue)10:59:02","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122742059\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122742059<\/a><br>More like %60-70, the ones in the West get our education.","time":1493132342,"resto":122718937,"id":"XJdZpAxE","country":"CA","country_name":"Canada"},{"no":122742144,"now":"04\/25\/17(Tue)10:59:20","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122741019\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122741019<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;reddit spacing<\/span><br>isis is a political issue.<br><br><a href=\"#p122741214\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122741214<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;reddit spacing<\/span><br>They want to control and rip Iraq to pieces.<br>They are the reason shia are ape tier all the time.<br>Shia are not the same as before.

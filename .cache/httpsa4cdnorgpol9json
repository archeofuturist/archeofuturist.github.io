At least I didn&#039;t vote for drumft! <br><br>I consider myself a feminist. I dont believe in enforced gender roles; they may happen naturally, but they should never be coerced into happening unnaturally. As in, the societal pressure for gender roles should really go, even if it&#039;ll turn out that the majority of relationships continue operating the same way of their own accord. I treat women with the same outlook I treat men, and never participate in the old Reddit &quot;women are crazy&quot; circlejerk, because there are multiple women out there and each have different personalities just like there are multiple men out there and each with different personalities. I don&#039;t think you do much of anything except scare off the awesome women out there by going on and on about the ones who aren&#039;t awesome. That doesnt mean I look for places to victimize women, I just dont believe it&#039;s fair to make generalizations such as the one about women acting like everything&#039;s OK when it&#039;s really not (and that&#039;s a particularly harsh example, because all humans do that). I&#039;m kind of tired of citing these examples and I&#039;m guessing you&#039;re getting tired of reading them, if you&#039;ve even made it this far. In closing, the people who know me in real life all respect me, as do a great many people in the Reddit brony community, where I spend most of my time and where I&#039;m pretty known for being helpful around the community.

Researchers Report Biological Correlations in Anal Sex Role in Gay Men","com":"<span class=\"quote\">&gt;While a single factor (the elusive \u201cgay gene,\u201d for example) has yet to emerge in the ongoing scientific investigation of what determines sexuality, there are a host of theories. Genetic factors, hormonal factors, immunological factors, and more have been posited as possible biological causes. However, many experts argue that it\u2019s most likely a confluence of factors, as Barbara L. Frankowski and Committee on Adolescence did in a 2004 article in Pediatrics: \u201cSexual orientation probably is not determined by any one factor but by a combination of genetic, hormonal, and environmental influences.\u201d<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Regardless of how wide-ranging these studies are, they tend to have one thing in common: they treat gay men as a monolithic group. But now a research team out of the University of Toronto Mississauga (Ashlyn Swift-Gallant, Lindsay A. Coome, D. Ashley Monks, and Doug P. VanderLaan) has investigated variation within the population of gay men based on their anal-sex roles (that is bottom, or receptive, top, or penetrative, and versatile, or both receptive and penetrative depending on circumstance). The results of two of their studies suggest there very well could be biological subgroups of gay men, which is to say that one\u2019s biological makeup could possibly (and most likely, indirectly) influence whether or not he likes to fuck or get fucked (or both).<\/span><br>http:\/\/jezebel.com\/born-to-bottom-r<wbr>esearchers-report-biological-correl<wbr>ati-1794233584","filename":"1493662662001","ext":".jpg","w":1200,"h":740,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":154,"tim":1493718353583,"time":1493718353,"md5":"6aZy31WgHB3W6g0MJaURdw==","fsize":80007,"resto":0,"id":"OnT4Vn45","country":"IL","m_img":1,"bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"born-to-bottom-researchers-report-biological","country_name":"Israel","replies":16,"images":4,"omitted_posts":11,"omitted_images":3},{"no":123755145,"now":"05\/02\/17(Tue)06:49:06","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123754759\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123754759<\/a><br><a href=\"#p123754423\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123754423<\/a><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;not having a Submissive gf and being submissive yourself<\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;not getting a dominant Bull to Dom you both<\/span><br><br>I have been kept in chastity for weeks and also clean up the cum out of my gf after our bull cums inside her.<br><br>Me and my gf are wearing a Choker when our bull is around and he does with us as he pleases.<br><br>One of the most memorable experiences is when our bull bred me in front of my gf and filled my boywomb with his virile cum.

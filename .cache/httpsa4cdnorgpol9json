Before I start though, I want to say that I fucking love America. I think it&#039;s a fantastic and fascinating country.<br><br>My question is: why does America so often look back and try to regain moments in its history, when in reality looking forward is what made it so great? In every era of American history people wanted to look back, but change continued to occur and America continued to grow. It went from a bunch of colonies to the biggest economic, social, military and cultural power to ever exist in world history, and it did this in 200 or so years. 1000 year old European nations failed to achieve half of what America has.<br><br>I supported Trump but I now wonder why the idea &quot;MAGA&quot; had any appeal to me. America never stopped being great and never will. If America stayed rooted and never changed, would it be where it is now? Would it have abolished slavery before the rest of the world did, awarded civil rights, landed on the moon, conquered the west economically and culturally, torn down the Berlin Wall, etc? Maybe you argue slavery should never have been abolished and women should never have been given the vote, but if that&#039;s the case, how can you as an American continue to celebrate your nation&#039;s journey to the top? You can&#039;t be selectively nationalist, you either celebrate the American success story or you don&#039;t. <br><br>I consider myself pretty conservative (UKIP and Leave supporter) but wonder whether trying to MAGA is the right way to approach things.

Exacerbating this is the willingness of doctors throughout the past few decades to prescribe opiates to their patients for the most minor of pain complaints, creating addictions and filling holes that were widened by dwindling economic prospects and a changing culture which downplays and mocks marriage and the image of a happy family (these days, the only family that&#039;s celebrated is the one with existential and interpersonal problems)<br><br>This is all waxing philosophical without identifying how to make a change, so we have to identify the political party preventing and, if anything, encouraging and promoting this trend: Democrats.<br><br>They celebrate and publicly laugh at white men committing suicide in record numbers<br>http:\/\/www.theblaze.com\/news\/2017\/0<wbr>4\/14\/watch-maine-democrats-laugh-ab<wbr>out-rising-suicide-rates-among-whit<wbr>e-males\/<br><br>Their embrace of free trade policies and sudden disregard for the working class while pushing for cheaper H1B labor and outsourcing is the equivalent of Republican restructuring voting zones while claiming that it has nothing to do with race: it&#039;s obvious bullshit to anyone who has enough street smarts to see it<br><br>tl;dr Dems are pushing policies targeting white men and encouraging them to commit suicide","time":1492796168,"resto":122158238,"id":"dh3GeWjF","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":122160680,"now":"04\/21\/17(Fri)13:38:03","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122158238\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122158238<\/a><br>- have to live in miserable suburbs.<br>- easy access to guns to end it.","time":1492796283,"resto":122158238,"id":"qX\/Kr4Js","country":"NL","country_name":"Netherlands"},{"no":122160758,"now":"04\/21\/17(Fri)13:38:43","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122158894\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122158894<\/a><br><a href=\"#p122159802\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122159802<\/a><br>This contributes to the issue but is hardly the damning factor.

The original sin is inability to possess sanctifying grace - the grace by which creatures can get to Heaven. It&#039;s pretty easy to get rid of this - the usual way is by baptism by water, although baptism of desire (desire of baptism combined with perfect love of God - a person who unexpectedly dies in such a state experiences the same effect as the one produced if they were actually baptised) suffices too, as does martyrdom. Notice that there is no right to sanctifying grace, it isn&#039;t inherent in nature of any creature. God by His own will gives it. This is the first reason why He is our saviour. You still have to deal with the other two, and there is no ordinary means to get rid of them. Of particualr interest to your question is concupiscence - before the Fall, the senses were completely submitted to reason. After the Fall, this condition was lost and now we have to struggle against sinful desires, which, even though we know they are wrong, are still tempting us. As is widely known from experience, we are tremendously bad at this - the worst that can happen to our soul, and indeed often happens, is mortal sin. Several sins - like murder, theft or lust - when committed with knowledge of their evil and with full consent - &quot;lock&quot; our souls on something which we identify as good, but which isn&#039;t God. When we live, this orientation of the soul can be changed, but not after death. Then, the soul is permanently set upon evil and as consequence is continuously and eternally punished. During life such a soul can&#039;t change its state by its own effort - for that, God Himself must intervene. Although it would still be just of Him to abandon this person, as the state they have put themselves into is their own, conscious choice, He neverthless prefers to have mercy on mortal sinners, giving them grace they need to reform themselves.","time":1492795492,"resto":122149878,"id":"KdlUoNY5","country":"PL","country_name":"Poland"},{"no":122160023,"now":"04\/21\/17(Fri)13:31:59","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122159279\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122159279<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;I believe that humanity is naturally good until someone fucks up, and then instead of correcting the problem individually people create rules and norms around it for the sake of efficiency thus creating morality<\/span><br><br>One of the basic notions upon which Catholicism is founded is that good is a real, objective thing, defined not by personal beliefs but inherent in the nature of reality.

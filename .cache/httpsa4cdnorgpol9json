After the death of ghaddafi, the flhx started. He was the one who blocked them.<br>Anyways, they roman free in the cities, i know people who teach italian to these people but classes are usually almost empty. Yes they have iphones. No nobodyfines them if they do not have a bus ticket. You can see them mostly shopping in a grocery store group of supermarkets named LIDL, which is german. I am assuming they five them free coupons to shop there. Or somethimf. They get \u20ac30-40 of cash per day. The other expenses like food, clothes, efc are all already covered by specific companies who host fhese people in specific buildings (nice buildings, i will be honest with you. They do not lice in slums. They are treated like actual human beings here in the north). These companies get funded by the government. also they pay almost no taxes.<br>They DO molest women from time to time. There has been an almost rape many times. Two that I know of surely. I have been seeing the same faces for years desu. These people are not looking for jobs. I guess the long term plan is moving to a country that will support them for an even longer amount of time,like france or sweden.<br><br>How do people feel about them:<br>older people: Empathic.

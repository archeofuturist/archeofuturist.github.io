Simply put: Muslims are hypocritical scumbags who loathe in their own Sharia ridden countries and, want to migrate to first world countries.","time":1490418695,"resto":118188719,"id":"kVhTvorS","country":"PK","country_name":"Pakistan"},{"no":118189834,"now":"03\/25\/17(Sat)01:18:43","name":"Anonymous","com":"Holland isn&#039;t a country you dip","time":1490419123,"resto":118188719,"id":"5iosLbpI","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":118189962,"now":"03\/25\/17(Sat)01:20:10","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118189834\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118189834<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;old image <\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;thinking OP made that image<\/span><br>kys mehmet","time":1490419210,"resto":118188719,"id":"kRFR5Uq\/","country":"US","country_name":"United States"}]},{"posts":[{"no":118188790,"now":"03\/25\/17(Sat)01:06:38","name":"Anonymous","com":"ITT: why is your country the best?","filename":"download","ext":".jpg","w":268,"h":188,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":175,"tim":1490418398280,"time":1490418398,"md5":"nBdH8uux6MBRW3XI1tR3yw==","fsize":23477,"resto":0,"id":"LOvhaGHR","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"itt-why-is-your-country-the-best","country_name":"United States","replies":10,"images":3,"omitted_posts":5,"omitted_images":3},{"no":118189306,"now":"03\/25\/17(Sat)01:12:30","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118189185\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118189185<\/a><br>You&#039;re not wrong","filename":"1485933299182","ext":".jpg","w":1080,"h":1123,"tn_w":120,"tn_h":125,"tim":1490418750190,"time":1490418750,"md5":"CAhIzMBiudySPfETv0rrvQ==","fsize":268112,"resto":118188790,"id":"2qMWFS2f","country":"US","m_img":1,"country_name":"United States"},{"no":118189340,"now":"03\/25\/17(Sat)01:12:50","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118188790\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118188790<\/a><br>Please nuke Canada","time":1490418770,"resto":118188790,"id":"FpFZrNa3","country":"CA","country_name":"Canada"},{"no":118189464,"now":"03\/25\/17(Sat)01:14:23","name":"Anonymous","com":"We are beat at being the best","filename":"1395284342325","ext":".png","w":634,"h":762,"tn_w":104,"tn_h":125,"tim":1490418863475,"time":1490418863,"md5":"YtmcY\/qAOSe8\/ql5nWbL5A==","fsize":267242,"resto":118188790,"id":"MwJ2RJYn","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":118189497,"now":"03\/25\/17(Sat)01:14:43","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118188790\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118188790<\/a><br>got to the moon first<br>will begin mining asteroids first<br>humble beginnings of second, larger ISS at LP2 before Trump&#039;s out of office<br>what a time to be alive<br>oh- did i mention the energy wall?","filename":"XH69JQikScMbnBqEQAiz27tUoMzi1AwJ_Y-eOxqkDuk","ext":".png","w":1024,"h":557,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":67,"tim":1490418883969,"time":1490418883,"md5":"lTmkeWwrHDGVNghW4yJMPQ==","fsize":474212,"resto":118188790,"id":"fJVuwOn7","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":118189944,"now":"03\/25\/17(Sat)01:19:54","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118189243\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118189243<\/a><br>You keep the Haitians away from us so that&#039;s cool.","time":1490419194,"resto":118188790,"id":"AXllHsPu","country":"US","country_name":"United States"}]},{"posts":[{"no":118189929,"now":"03\/25\/17(Sat)01:19:49","name":"Anonymous","com":"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=Bf3<wbr>e9Cl1-Bs<br><br>What happened leafs :&#039;(<br><br>Our culture is dying in favor of virtue signaling politicians for the sake of having diversity.","filename":"1490208072061","ext":".jpg","w":567,"h":437,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":192,"tim":1490419189134,"time":1490419189,"md5":"q0Qcrq4m1fyrtTIPIqfWLw==","fsize":35595,"resto":0,"id":"HVkLFV8V","country":"CA","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"what-happened-leafs","country_name":"Canada","replies":0,"images":0}]},{"posts":[{"no":118178914,"now":"03\/24\/17(Fri)23:23:56","name":"Anonymous","sub":"Trump got BTFO today","com":"I just love when the biggest cuck in the nation gets pwned.

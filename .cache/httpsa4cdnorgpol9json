These combination toilet-bidets (washlet) with seat warmers, or attachable bidets are particularly popular in Japan and South Korea, found in approximately 60% of households.[citation needed] They are commonly found in hotels and even some public facilities.

My big, juicy ass has never felt cleaner. When I returned I felt filthy and always left the bathroom unsatisfied and ashamed.

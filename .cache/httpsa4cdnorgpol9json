The answer to that question is noone. You might think the elites might use it to rid the earth of their enemies and reduce population, but even for them this way of doing it a) causes to many side effects and influence on nature and b) has too many variables, since you can&#039;t be sure who nukes where and you can&#039;t plan the outcome good enough to be able to stabilize a new society afterwards.<br><br>I mean look at the war zones we have today, war isn&#039;t what it used to be and the war in those countries is neverending. In a land where the infrastructure is destroyed, economics don&#039;t exist anymore and people lost all good belief there will be only chaos. This chaos would last for at least some decades and again the outcome would be very unstable and hard to plan for.<br><br>Second we have to ask ourselves why everyone keeps their bombs then. This one is simple and you heard it before: So no madman can push the button without killing himself. And there is a second answer: You can use nuclear weapons on a smaller scale for tactical combat. Small rounds with nuclear parts that wreck a lot of devastation will come, will be in use and will not influence nature too much. You can predict the outcome. This is very dangerous and unsettling, but won&#039;t lead to an all out nuclear war.<br><br>And there there is someting else people don&#039;t think about enough: Having an all out nuclear war only occurs when it is clear who shot first. All scenarios are like &quot;A attacks B who is partners with C, they shoot back but A is partners with D and will retaliate.&quot; and so on. Have you ever thought about that the &quot;new&quot; nuclear danger is not countries nuking it each other, but CovertOps looking like terrorist action? If you are Putin you could easily set up a CovertOps of Pseudo-Terrorists getting a quite small bomb into NY for example. You could blow up the city, and the US could not react.","filename":"1490157559435","ext":".jpg","w":1920,"h":1080,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":140,"tim":1490684412141,"time":1490684412,"md5":"qup1ycdk+bXuDM9BVh+GOA==","fsize":719699,"resto":0,"id":"uAKegO7Y","country":"DE","m_img":1,"bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"why-a-nuclear-war-wont-happen","country_name":"Germany","replies":80,"images":4,"omitted_posts":75,"omitted_images":4},{"no":118635571,"now":"03\/28\/17(Tue)06:32:47","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118634465\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118634465<\/a><br>I concur.","time":1490697167,"resto":118623143,"id":"uAKegO7Y","country":"DE","country_name":"Germany"},{"no":118635725,"now":"03\/28\/17(Tue)06:35:34","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118624252\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118624252<\/a><br>If the world fight&#039;s back against (((their))) grip, be assured they would rather nuke the planet than lose.","time":1490697334,"resto":118623143,"id":"SbuwHb6k","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":118635950,"now":"03\/28\/17(Tue)06:38:47","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118626342\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118626342<\/a><br>America has the most poisonous one too, along with UK and some others.

If our world is to survive for the next 100 or 1000 years, we cannot have two or even three sides who could just with one button erase life on earth. The moment a crazy person (think Kim Jong Un) can get such powers, the whole world should shiver. Maybe not with todays technology, but with technology we very possible will have in the future.<br><br><br>So back to my point, the best opportunity for a strike when one side has a clear technology advantage. I think we&#039;re close to that moment in history right now. With missile defense shields and cyber-warfare, we can shoot down missiles over russia or destroy any ICBM launch facilities. The hard part would be to shoot down missiles from russian submarines, as they would come from unknown locations. <br><br>Very soon, if we aren&#039;t already there, it will be entirely possible to wipe out russian nuclear capabilities, and all bombing we&#039;ll have to do would be focused on the russian warships and tanks.<br><br>The diplomatic solution is most likely a side-show. Domestic disputes and internal turmoil are probably the best way for a regime change, but when the state who has previously orchestrated regime changes suffers from one itself, it just wouldn&#039;t work.<br><br>Probably nothing will happen, but who knows...i just think it would make sense if you&#039;re a crazy enough to do it.","time":1490698101,"resto":118623143,"id":"pPbuPxlT","country":"NO","country_name":"Norway"},{"no":118637463,"now":"03\/28\/17(Tue)07:01:48","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118623143\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118623143<\/a><br><br>it&#039;s not a rational calculus<br><br>you&#039;re wrong<br><br>\/thread","time":1490698908,"resto":118623143,"id":"WKBNRzlc","country":"US","country_name":"United States"}]},{"posts":[{"no":118634850,"now":"03\/28\/17(Tue)06:21:26","name":"Anonymous","sub":"4chan blocked at Rome airport.","com":"Sex education.","filename":"Screenshot_2017-03-28-09-09-23_com.android.chrome","ext":".png","w":1080,"h":1920,"tn_w":140,"tn_h":250,"tim":1490696486237,"time":1490696486,"md5":"VsHlIXHr+18n2P1jfA2PNw==","fsize":229901,"resto":0,"id":"NKInu37v","country":"MT","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"4chan-blocked-at-rome-airport","country_name":"Malta","replies":2,"images":0},{"no":118635901,"now":"03\/28\/17(Tue)06:38:05","name":"Anonymous","com":"Italy is full of Catholic retards, dont be surprised","time":1490697485,"resto":118634850,"id":"BgakCODK","country":"NO","country_name":"Norway"},{"no":118636538,"now":"03\/28\/17(Tue)06:47:17","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118634850\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118634850<\/a><br>Wtf how is 4chan sex education?","time":1490698037,"resto":118634850,"id":"6hvPeYO8","country":"CA","country_name":"Canada"}]},{"posts":[{"no":118604017,"now":"03\/27\/17(Mon)23:19:06","name":"Anonymous","sub":"Hope thread.","com":"In the face of an enemy that seems unbeatable hopelessness and despair can set in, leading to frustration, unbridled hatred, and destruction of personal relationships. <br><br>This thread is for good vibes, hope, feels, and that burning determination in our hearts that won us the presidency.

Many of the rural areas surrounding it have dial up, satellite, or no internet at all.

Rather than allow that to happen, Tennessee&#039;s legislature just voted to give Comcast and AT&amp;T a $45 million taxpayer handout.<br>This year, the Tennessee state legislature was finally considering a bill that would have let EPB expand its coverage (without providing it any special tax breaks or grants; EPB is profitable and doesn&#039;t rely on taxpayer money). Rather than pass that bill, Tennessee has just passed the &quot;Broadband Accessibility Act of 2017,&quot; which gives private telecom companies\u2014in this case, probably AT&amp;T and Comcast\u2014$45 million of taxpayer money over the next three years to build internet infrastructure to rural areas.<br><br>To be clear: EPB wanted to build out its gigabit fiber network to many of these same communities using money it has on hand or private loans at no cost to taxpayers. It would then charge individual residents for internet service. Instead, Tennessee taxpayers will give $45 million in tax breaks and grants to giant companies just to get basic infrastructure built. They will then get the opportunity to pay these companies more money for worse internet than they would have gotten under EPB&#039;s proposal.","filename":"image","ext":".jpg","w":620,"h":320,"tn_w":249,"tn_h":129,"tim":1491989145439,"time":1491989145,"md5":"aV8GI3vdkCyvbWNriP527A==","fsize":68814,"resto":0,"id":"uHvQ5V36","country":"GB","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"tennessee-votes-to-pay-45-million-for-slower","country_name":"United Kingdom","replies":41,"images":4,"omitted_posts":36,"omitted_images":4},{"no":120741566,"now":"04\/12\/17(Wed)06:39:14","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120739220\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120739220<\/a><br>Who cares about mobile?","time":1491993554,"resto":120736602,"id":"\/+mxZIPk","country":"DE","country_name":"Germany"},{"no":120741747,"now":"04\/12\/17(Wed)06:41:36","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120736602\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120736602<\/a><br>Kill them.","time":1491993696,"resto":120736602,"id":"xXr+oGap","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":120742145,"now":"04\/12\/17(Wed)06:47:34","name":"Anonymous","com":"<span class=\"quote\">&gt;muh internet<\/span>","time":1491994054,"resto":120736602,"id":"\/Yp3TVtv","country":"BG","country_name":"Bulgaria"},{"no":120743337,"now":"04\/12\/17(Wed)07:05:51","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120741566\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120741566<\/a><br>Certainly not you, you basement dwelling fatass. <br>You missed the part where even normal Internet is routed through copper wire and slow as fuck and more expensive than elsewhere.","time":1491995151,"resto":120736602,"id":"jhaVxZb8","country":"DE","country_name":"Germany"},{"no":120745751,"now":"04\/12\/17(Wed)07:40:42","name":"Anonymous","com":"https:\/\/motherboard.vice.com\/en_us\/<wbr>article\/the-21-laws-states-use-to-c<wbr>rush-broadband-competition<br><br>This should make you guys even angrier.

There is only 1 thing here that scares me. Ethnic parties. Having 40% or even more of the parliament being minority parties would be madness.<\/span><br>Most people in Iran don&#039;t really look at each other as different ethnicities though. Genetically most Iranian ethnicities come from the ancient persians anyways, and its more about them developing their own languages due to isolation, but that isolation doesn&#039;t really exist anymore, so at the end of the day most Iranian groups are the same people.","time":1491996301,"resto":120736240,"id":"B5BWRwO5","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":120744673,"now":"04\/12\/17(Wed)07:26:28","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120743811\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120743811<\/a><br>Anyways I have to go to sleep (have to wake up in 90 minutes for fajr) and my laptop is at 4%.<br>Shab bekhehr :)<br>(and ya I&#039;m the guy from \/mena\/ lel)","time":1491996388,"resto":120736240,"id":"B5BWRwO5","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":120744756,"now":"04\/12\/17(Wed)07:27:57","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120744673\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120744673<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;(and ya I&#039;m the guy from \/mena\/ lel)<\/span><br>I guessed as much.<br><br>See you around mate.","time":1491996477,"resto":120736240,"id":"bg77OAMX","country":"RO","country_name":"Romania"},{"no":120744928,"now":"04\/12\/17(Wed)07:30:36","name":"Anonymous","com":"Reminder that thanks to you dumbfuck nazis and your muslim loving ways there are shitskins posting self important essays in this thread.","time":1491996636,"resto":120736240,"id":"SJEx8Om\/","country":"AU","country_name":"Australia"}]},{"posts":[{"no":120735479,"now":"04\/12\/17(Wed)05:06:53","name":"Anonymous","sub":"PAYBACK","com":"Destroy Islam: Five part plan<br><br>1.

Ridicule islam. Humour is not a choice. If it is funny people will laugh. Especially make fun of Muhammad, Mekka, the quran and things that muslims don\u2019t want you to joke about. Try to make fun of it in ways muslims dislike, they dislike gays, they dislike drawings of muhammad, they dislike a lot of things. Be creative.<br><br>3. Emasculate the men. Make up and spread the meme about the weak muslim man. Fat, hairy, smelly, small asian penis, impotent, cuck, gay, likes to dress up as a girl at home. So many transmen in the muslim community who only wants to be a boipussy for the white man etc. Be creative, come up with something we\u2019ve seen before done to asians and whites, or come up with something completely new.<br><br>4. Spread doubt about the womans chastity. Muslim women og fix their hymen on our clinics because they fuck so many white men. Do to them what they did to us, but this time it will be more fun, because you know they will rage hard.<br><br>5. Delegitimize their beliefs, values and traditions.

It&#039;s a national appellation, like &quot;Californian&quot;. Judea at the time was a multi-ethnic &quot;kingdom&quot; (thanks to Jews) with real Israelites mixed in. This is why Jesus preached in parables to the crowds but later told the disciples the true meaning, and that the message was only for true Israelites and not the whole multitude. <br><br>Anyway, the reason Paul was writing to the Galatians in the first place is because he knew they were lost white Israelite brethren who had been separated from their identity before the Israelites had received the mosaic law. They were the wild uncultivated olive tree that would be grafted back in to Israel and reconciled through Christ. The reason he is saying that there is no Judean or Gentile (of the nations of the known mediterranean\/Asia minor world, i.e. white civilizations) is because they are all Israelites by blood and able to receive Christ&#039;s gift. This is also why he tells the judeans not to be jealous just because they had the law of Moses. <br><br>From Christogenea: &quot;the Galatians to whom this is addressed were primarily Hellenized Gauls, who were Kelts, with some Greeks and Romans among them.

Paul knew that these Galatians: Kelts, Greeks and Romans, were the \u201clost\u201d Israelites, as he demonstrates so often in his epistles, and here he tells them as much in this very chapter, and in chapter 4, verse 28 where he says \u201cAnd we, brethren, down through Isaac, are children of promise\u201d.

The families of other races which are never a concern of the Scripture cannot be justly forced into this Genesis chapter 12 context. This is why we have a genealogy in Genesis chapter 10, so that we may recognize these nations. If all of the world\u2019s races were descended from Adam, the identity of the families of Noah would not even matter and therefore there would be no need for such a genealogy.

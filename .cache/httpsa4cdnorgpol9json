Biology says protect the females. Women can say, &quot;I don&#039;t need protection&quot; doesn&#039;t matter you&#039;re playing with instinct.

And fight over females. Doesn&#039;t matter if everyone&#039;s a highly trained professional and overtly everyone behaves. The female still will be signalling and the males still will be responding. Having females around really messes with moral.<br><br>Lastly, I notice that females in military don&#039;t have mandatory birth control. Female wants out she just gets pregnant. I&#039;m quite sure if given the option 2\/3&#039;s of the guys at Verdun or Monte Cassino or at Chosin Reservoir or Hue would have gone with pregnancy if only they could get the hell out of there. If the shit ever starts getting heavy a large chunk of the female force will suddenly become indisposed. And its not like the civilian population will tolerate a lot of women coming back in bags.

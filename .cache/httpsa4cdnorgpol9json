How is it not the same to just bend your torso toward your legs, like in pic related, and just rest your arm on your legs, like in pic related? You can bend pretty far like that and still be comfortable. In fact, the toilet seat is more comfortable if you bend instead of squat like that because more surface area of your ass is touching the bowl lid.","filename":"stock-photo-man-missing-you-wearing-a-long-sleeve-shirt-black-pants-brown-leather-shoes-short-haircut-a-224857600[1]","ext":".jpg","w":300,"h":470,"tn_w":79,"tn_h":125,"tim":1491154145746,"time":1491154145,"md5":"P9Av3wQ94FxdCfXsl49ZRA==","fsize":52797,"resto":119214730,"id":"+jiwAjCC","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":119222066,"now":"04\/02\/17(Sun)13:33:51","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119215880\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119215880<\/a><br>mods","time":1491154431,"resto":119214730,"id":"\/x4rOEN7","country":"SA","country_name":"Saudi Arabia"}]},{"posts":[{"no":119221291,"now":"04\/02\/17(Sun)13:26:33","name":"Anonymous","com":"1. Spics have higher welfare usage rates than Blacks.<br>2. WM\/SpicF couples have higher divorce rates than WMWF. <br>3. Spics have voted overwhelmingly democrat in every single election since they started being counted 40 years ago. Just like blacks.<br>4. Spic countries have the highest homicide rates in the world, to point that Uganda and the Congo look peaceful.<br>5. Spics are not White. The average Mexican is 57% Native, 37% European, and 5% African. This is barely &quot;Whiter&quot; than Africans Americans who are on average 25% European.<br>6. Spics have triple the homicide rate of Whites in the US, even though Muhammed and Achmed are included in \u201cNon-Hispanic White.\u201d<br>7. The most successful Spic nations are barely wealthier than the absolute poorest European nations.<br>8. Spics have significantly higher obesity rates than Whites.<br>9. Spics have an average IQ range of 80 to 90, some variation depending on sources but close to a standard deviation below whites (Blacks have about 1 standard deviation from Whites)<br>10. There is no \u201cmelting pot.\u201d We had laws in place to exclude all non-White immigrants. Since the US was formed, it has always been 80-90% Non-Spic White, comparable to European countries. The remaining population was black and could not vote or hold significant power. So who created the politics? The laws? The economy? The technology? Whites. That\u2019s why the US is a White nation. A nation is not the ground it was built on, it is the work of the people.<br>11. \u201cSpics can be great! Look at Cubans!\u201d Cubans have very low Native blood. They are basically either Spaniard, Black, or a negro mix. Therefore, \u201cWhite Cubans\u201d probably actually are White.<br>(Sources will be in a reply to this post)<br><br>The biggest difference between Spics and Blacks is that Spics are taking over our country.<br><br>Middle Easterners make up less than 4% of Germany.

Enjoy then consumerism which doesn&#039;t solve the problem of vanity which religion offers an answer to. And I could go on and on for paragraphs talking about how religion keeps people in shape. Anyways thanks to industrialization\/consumerism and a nationwide atmosphere of tolerance of what was deemed wrong in the past gives room for many people an option to live like utter hogs and whores, wallowing in degeneracy. Interesting how in Christianity the serious Christians achieve character through willful suffering by denial of their ego thus it&#039;s easily noticeable they are much more mature and have much more character than your typical person. Also no atheist has ever disproved the supernatural phenomenon occurring in religion sometimes, so honestly who gives a shit if some fat pope who doesn&#039;t even believe in what he says &quot;controls&quot; people by being the top authoritative figure of a religion when the poor people at the financial bottom might have in the literal sense 200 times more character and actually experience what they call god. But nope, gotta live according by primordial instincts and lusts right? And later wonder what should be done to fill in the void of loneliness. So in conclusion do a thorough research of religion and only then try to rationalize it after you&#039;ve studied the origin of it, the occult parts of it, the supernatural aspects of it, the philosophical viewpoint of it and only then give you opinion which prob. won&#039;t be so much based on your ignorant emotions. And I&#039;ll you a headsup, the very essence of religion lies in what is the prime animator of life here on earth.","time":1490871363,"resto":118891457,"id":"LnzVXaPQ","country":"US","country_name":"United States"}]},{"posts":[{"no":118910108,"now":"03\/30\/17(Thu)06:54:50","name":"Anonymous","com":"What are YOU doing towards ensuring the safety of your family, your neighborhood, your people \/pol\/?<br><br>Are you already prepping?","filename":"Pepe_Punisher","ext":".jpg","w":1148,"h":1200,"tn_w":239,"tn_h":250,"tim":1490871290992,"time":1490871290,"md5":"gL5v6SVzqtFzxP2xjxJQpQ==","fsize":390947,"resto":0,"id":"as5XC3nt","country":"ES","m_img":1,"bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"what-are-you-doing-towards-ensuring-the-safety-of","country_name":"Spain","replies":1,"images":0},{"no":118910151,"now":"03\/30\/17(Thu)06:55:25","name":"Anonymous","com":"nothing","time":1490871325,"resto":118910108,"id":"0oVp4BB7","country":"US","country_name":"United States"}]},{"posts":[{"no":118910150,"now":"03\/30\/17(Thu)06:55:23","name":"Anonymous","com":"Have you<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;incorporated your shadow<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;slayed your dragon<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;saved your father<\/span><br>If not, what the fuck are you doing here?","filename":"1489671414089","ext":".jpg","w":2000,"h":1333,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":166,"tim":1490871323844,"time":1490871323,"md5":"acOBdhdZKRSty1Uk2JwBQQ==","fsize":213265,"resto":0,"id":"wxZ14+6i","country":"AU","m_img":1,"bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"have-you","country_name":"Australia","replies":0,"images":0}]},{"posts":[{"no":118894657,"now":"03\/30\/17(Thu)02:43:55","name":"Anonymous","com":"Hitler was a fucking lunatic.

A classic example arises from Hans Christian Andersens\u2019 fable of the Emperor\u2019s New Clothes: the fact that the emperor in fact has no clothes is mutual knowledge, but not common knowledge, because everyone (save, eventually, for a small child) is refusing to acknowledge the emperor\u2019s nakedness, thus perpetuating the charade that the emperor is actually wearing some incredibly expensive and special clothing that is only visible to a select few. My own personal favourite example of the distinction comes from the blue-eyed islander puzzle, discussed previously here, here and here on the blog. (By the way, I would ask that any commentary about that puzzle be directed to those blog posts, rather than to the current one.)<br><br>I believe that there is now a real-life instance of this situation in the US presidential election, regarding the following<br><br>Proposition 1. The presumptive nominee of the Republican Party, Donald Trump, is not even remotely qualified to carry out the duties of the presidency of the United States of America.<br><br>Proposition 1 is a statement which I think is approaching the level of mutual knowledge amongst the US population (and probably a large proportion of people following US politics overseas): even many of Trump\u2019s nominal supporters secretly suspect that this proposition is true, even if they are hesitant to say it out loud.","filename":"06d081a74c990871583f69fa892d2252","ext":".jpg","w":620,"h":346,"tn_w":249,"tn_h":139,"tim":1490867226854,"time":1490867226,"md5":"BtCBp0yZCHFYP2n6iS0iUg==","fsize":40014,"resto":0,"id":"I7PSbxLf","country":"CA","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"in-logic-there-is-a-subtle-but-important","country_name":"Canada","replies":7,"images":3,"omitted_posts":2,"omitted_images":1},{"no":118908614,"now":"03\/30\/17(Thu)06:31:15","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118906195\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118906195<\/a><br>This is neither a solid piece of mathematical reasoning nor a well-articulated piece of political commentary. I\u2019m not sure which Mr. Tao intended it to be. All it boils down to is a mere assertion of his politics couched in logical form (use of the pretentious phrasing \u201cproposition 1\u201d) as though this were something to be deductively proven.<br><br>Mr. Tao should also tell us what he believes would constitute a remote qualification \u2013 the words used in \u201cproposition 1\u201d. Since apparently this proposition is going to be proven to deductive certainty, one should expect a full fleshing-out of the word \u201cqualified\u201d here, so as to prevent ambiguity. I might recommend a checklist format to assure complete transparency. In addition, Mr. Tao should feel free to speculate as to why each of the qualifications on this imagined checklist are necessary to hold office.<br><br>Nonetheless, it is always quite lively to point out that even those academically-minded people, where people naively expect them to hold sophisticated thoughts in fields outside their occupation, end up doing nothing more than regurgitating trivialities. Here, we observe Mr. Tao\u2019s espousal of the trivial statement \u201cTrump is unfit for office (whatever \u201cfit\u201d means)\u201d along with a case which is made no better than a bungling political commentator. It will also be amusing to see particle physicists, organic chemists, algebaists, and other academics step outside their limited domains of expertise to offer us their opinions and guts feeling, masquerading as sophisticated and informed political positions.","time":1490869875,"resto":118906195,"id":"N9uJeWhP","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":118908691,"now":"03\/30\/17(Thu)06:32:24","name":"Dr Sage and Mr Hide","com":"fuck off with your shit OP","filename":"1468101069926","ext":".jpg","w":310,"h":394,"tn_w":98,"tn_h":125,"tim":1490869944936,"time":1490869944,"md5":"ISiMpy049X84ZAQEJ+Z0XA==","fsize":34259,"resto":118906195,"id":"9QpzGchX","country":"TH","country_name":"Thailand"},{"no":118909163,"now":"03\/30\/17(Thu)06:39:55","name":"Anonymous","com":"Maybe he should define what he deems &#039;qualifications&#039; fit for presidency. <br><br>There&#039;s no president school or anything.

A new but completly unlikeable protagonist. The game got so &quot;restriced&quot; and bad, building a deck was futile because the cards you couldn&#039;t use the cards you wanted to anyway. When they started play cards on bikes I completly refused it and anything related. It was just too stupid and disgusting. I forgot everything about this until just now, even though I had some nice and fun memories in the beginning. <br><br>Why am I posting this on \/pol\/?<br>Because even though this is related to a japanese cartoon, this is actually how leftists do their deads. They see you like something and then twist it and pervert it until you either cry like a litte girl or turn away in disgust.<br><br>Oldfags know this principle. It is and was always the modus operandi on this site, it&#039;s fun. However the difference between oldfags fun and current year leftists is still significant. <br><br>It funny when you don&#039;t discriminate and there is nothing you can&#039;t make fun of. It boring and unfunny if you have a political agenda and only try to destroy what doesn&#039;t fit into it... and that&#039;s why leftists can&#039;t

RECORDED ACID ATTACKS IN LONDON SINCE 2011","com":"Acid attacks in Britain&#039;s capital are soaring to new heights, new data reveals. <br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;A Freedom of Information request submitted by the Mirror shows that between 2011 and 2016, London had nearly 1,500 cases of the devastating crime, which burns the skin and leaves victims cowering from their injuries.<\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;In the long term, the scale of the injuries are so scarring that victims can often suffer serious psychological damage as a result of the attacks. Last year alone, there were 431 such acid attacks \u2013 a rise of 170 cases from the year prior. The figures match a general UK trend, in which the crime rate for such attacks has risen by 50% since 2005.<\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Globally, roughly 80% of victims tend to women. Attacks are often carried out by vengeful men who have had their marriage proposals or sexual advances rebuffed. However, acid attack charities in the UK estimate that British victims are predominantly men, at roughly 71% of victims. Jaf Shah, the executive director of the support group Acid Survivors Trust International (ASTI), told the Guardian: &quot;Looking at the data in general, there is a fairly large probability that a high percentage of the incidents are male-on-male attacks and most likely to be gang-related.<\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;&quot;The numbers appear to be very high and suggest an increase, which is very concerning.&quot; A former gang member described how acid attacks had become more acceptable and were not seen as a &quot;big deal&quot;. &quot;People don&#039;t think of the consequences,&quot; he said. &quot;It&#039;s easy to buy most of the ingredients legally\u2026One of my cousins was done a few years ago.

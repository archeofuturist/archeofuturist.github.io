New energy sources or energy management or both would allow for extreme changes in the world. Scarcity of most resources would decrease to levels far below even that of what they are today. Not making money will not be as big of a deal as it is today. The world currently produces far more than enough food for every person on the planet to eat three times per day, however, the problem in large part is transportation\/distribution and of course greed\/profit (i.e. why feed someone when you don&#039;t earn money for it). It may sound like socialism\/communism to provide food for everyone on Earth without money being involved, however, the very fundamental nature of the political and resource climate after sentient AI will be stupendously different as advancements in technology will be so monumentally radical most people currently do not even have an even basic concept of it. Feeding the planet and providing health care for everyone will be an immensely easy thing to do.<br><br>Of course, there&#039;s any number of issues that could arise... let&#039;s say the Elite class controls a sentient AI and it&#039;s knowledge and advancements are not made available to anyone but the Elites themselves... well, that would be a fucked up situation. There is a race on at this very time to develop the first truly sentient AI and if they wrong people obtain it first, it could spell disaster and suffering for most of the world&#039;s people. It&#039;s actually possible (though probably unlikely) that some organization (i.e. government, corporation, research group etc) already has developed and activated a sentient AI. If that&#039;s the case, in all probability (based on the corrupt nature of certain types of people) whoever it is will keep it secret at any cost and will end up with magnificent degrees of power the likes that humanity has never before seen in all of history.","filename":"ascii matrix pepe","ext":".gif","w":800,"h":792,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":123,"tim":1491443487575,"time":1491443487,"md5":"fApaeq6+ht+s6Cdu6qdlrQ==","fsize":621126,"resto":119684427,"id":"JJ2gvCFZ","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":119689159,"now":"04\/05\/17(Wed)21:59:25","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119684427\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119684427<\/a><br><a href=\"#p119685213\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119685213<\/a><br>I hope they kill us all","time":1491443965,"resto":119684427,"id":"cwv6OoSK","country":"CA","country_name":"Canada"},{"no":119689217,"now":"04\/05\/17(Wed)22:00:05","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119687300\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119687300<\/a><br>Wouldn&#039;t it be nice if one of the first accomplishments of a truly sentient would be to engineer some sort of infectious agent or nanotechnology that would specifically and only target the plague of the Earth that is niggers!? <br><br>Wew lad... it&#039;s of course unlikely but considering the stupendously radical advancements in technology and science a sentient AI would produce, it would technically be a possibility and the technology\/science itself of such a thing would be supremely easy for such an AI. <br><br>We can hope!","filename":"pepe laughs","ext":".jpg","w":400,"h":388,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":121,"tim":1491444005534,"time":1491444005,"md5":"ljuVh7kiuPd9\/D5EmjjUPA==","fsize":16558,"resto":119684427,"id":"JJ2gvCFZ","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":119689265,"now":"04\/05\/17(Wed)22:00:30","name":"Anonymous","com":"I hate conversations about AIs; people take what&#039;s happening now with algorithms and automation then try to extrapolate about artificial minds \/ brains.

Did I not tell you just a few days ago to be careful defending this blow hard. Trump has done nothing but talk since he took office......well if don&#039;t count appointing jew bankers to run country&#039;s finances, calling for another 60 billion in military spending, making obamacare even worse by trying ti fix it, putting his Jew son-in-law as his &quot;other&quot; vice president, etc. And now it looks like he will continue the Western War Mongering right where Obama left off, who picked up right where Bush left off.<br><br>Now you are seeing the light? Well I am sure most will after another 30 days of constant bs out of Trumplethinskin.","filename":"trumpoo","ext":".jpg","w":946,"h":798,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":210,"tim":1491443847869,"time":1491443847,"md5":"VkwpIlxZl0Ldc\/54vr8\/RQ==","fsize":149033,"resto":0,"id":"txUgka6b","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"fuck-trump-fuck-trump","country_name":"United States","replies":1,"images":1},{"no":119690330,"now":"04\/05\/17(Wed)22:11:37","name":"Anonymous","filename":"1490985415174","ext":".png","w":512,"h":512,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":125,"tim":1491444697705,"time":1491444697,"md5":"duAh5L\/ZjvOYMU7MET4nNw==","fsize":92646,"resto":119688947,"id":"Cb6tPG5D","country":"RS","country_name":"Serbia"}]},{"posts":[{"no":119687606,"now":"04\/05\/17(Wed)21:43:44","name":"Anonymous","com":"Girl posted this on her Facebook in reference to the movie Monsters, Inc.

Not saying you talk nonsense, I just haven&#039;t worked in alternatives to QM and like for 4 years I stopped reading any Physics in my free time. <br><br>What do you mean photons know the frequency of a material they interact with before they make contact? If you have a wave packet, you will have photons of several different frequencies, some of which might coincide with the resonance frequency of the atoms or whatever you&#039;re thinking about. If you had a monochromatic ray of light thrown against a &quot;material with some frequency&quot; and they wouldn&#039;t coincide, you&#039;d have no resonant effect. Not sure I get what you mean by knowing beforehand.<br><br>Time distortion at heavy mass and high speeds, why wouldn&#039;t it work?<br><br><a href=\"#p122451000\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122451000<\/a><br>Basically like with the other anon, I never studied alternatives to QM or got too interested on them. However Bohm was a good phycisist, I guess it can make sense. <br><br>The field of alternatives of Copenhagen is much more reduced than it seems, it&#039;s really over-represented outthere. Not saying this is good or bad, probably we need to think QM more carefully, but still.","time":1492968556,"resto":122424511,"id":"fRcuBy9f","country":"IT","country_name":"Italy"},{"no":122452070,"now":"04\/23\/17(Sun)13:29:47","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122451038\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122451038<\/a><br><br>Im the queen of england, and nothing you have said has contributed to the conversation in the slightest. You sound like a fucking moron who has at best taken Econ 101 at JuCo from a fucking marxist.

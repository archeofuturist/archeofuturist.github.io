For instance if we reduce it down to a tiny example of 100 people, and they pay five men to act as a policing force in ensuring safety and the upholding of social contracts, those five men are fathers and husbands and uncles and friends of the people in the community an it is their responsibility and interest to police it fairly and diligently because of this.

I think governments use coercion and force to enforce their view on how they might best benefit the public on people who do not agree with their views. All laws are made by the people are they not? I do not think there is some abstract organization creating laws for the sole purpose of subjugating the populous. The problem with this is that if you try to govern many people all at once, some will not like your laws. However, you need to force them to obey your laws so that you may benefit the maximum amount of people even if that requires sacrificing a small percentage of the population.<br><br>Sometimes, some people might not agree with some laws the government makes, sometimes they do. I can not argue that the sole result of government is the benefit of the populous, but that is their intend purpose. There are of course many flaws and loopholes in their system.<br><br>If their interests involve not paying taxes, then they ought not live within that community or that country or benefit from any service the government provides.

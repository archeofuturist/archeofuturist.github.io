It is known in occult circles as the black sun, the inner trauma that binds us to karmic cycles. The wound in Christ&#039;s side. This is the result of denial of self love, which is projected onto the external world, often resulting from a reaction to being position of subjugation to an oppressor and reflecting the others nature outwards. It might sound like hippy washy bullshit, but love is syntropy and homeostasis, which naturally arises OUT of chaos.

You, consciousness, arises out of the same chaotic fluctuations into which cyclically it perishes, however it&#039;s very arising suggests a momentum toward increased complexity as a consequence of increased entropy, an increase in the wavelength of the wave, within the universal system.

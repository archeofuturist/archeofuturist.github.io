I felt kind of sick after eating it and biting on chunks of fat made me gag and my stomach turn. For about 5 years I went full vegetarian. Even smelling meat was hard and disgusting. <br><br>It changed when I was invited to a celebration feast for a completed apprenticeship. We&#039;ve been about 20 guys an a big table with pretty much anything from salat to fish to meat and bread, in a nice restaurant. <br><br>Of course I started with salat and vegetables, but everything was so awsome and tasty, more tasty than anything I&#039;ve eaten before in my life. I enjoyed it so much, I had to try everything on the table including the various meat dishes. Not only it was so good I felt like crying, only a few minutes later a unique satisfying wave of warmth filled every cell in my body. Only then I understood my body desired this for a very long time and I selfishly denied it. Nothing can compare to giving your body what it truly wants and needs.<br><br>Days after that meal I felt like a changed person. I could think better and was full of energy. My face had a healthy color and smelled better. <br><br>No matter what anyone says, you cannot replace meat in your diet. Soja Product and various other Products to get the Proteins? It&#039;s all a lie.<br><br>Don&#039;t buy cheap shit from a discouter. Nothing can compare to quality meat and a cook who knows what he&#039;s doing. Never looked back to the vegetarian life, I only regret beeing so dumb for many years and miss out on good food.<br><br>Also, many politically correct people seem to be vegetarians and vegans thus making eating meat politically incorrect for some reason. Proof, the following posts made by SJW calling me an inhuman moster and showing cute animals while asking &quot;How can you hurt this cute animal!?&quot;<br><br>Thanks for reading my

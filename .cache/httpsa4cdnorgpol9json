As a result, &quot;all or nearly all of the directors (of the widely despised Ministry of Public Security of Poland) were Jewish&quot; as noted by Polish journalist Teresa Tora\u0144ska among others.[71][72] A recent study by the Polish Institute of National Remembrance showed that out of 450 people in director positions in the Ministry between 1944 and 1954, 167 (37.1%) were of Jewish ethnicity, while Jews made up only 1% of the post-war Polish population.[31] While Jews were overrepresented in various Polish communist organizations, including the security apparatus, relative to their percentage of the general population, the vast majority of Jews did not participate in the Stalinist apparatus, and indeed most were not supportive of communism.[47] Krzysztof Szwagrzyk has quoted Jan T. Gross, who argued that many Jews who worked for the communist party cut their ties with their culture \u2013 Jewish, Polish or Russian \u2013 and tried to represent the interests of international communism only, or at least that of the local communist government.[31]<\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Among the notable Jewish officials of the Polish secret police and security services were Minister Jakub Berman, Joseph Stalin&#039;s right hand in the PRL; Vice-minister Roman Romkowski (head of MBP), Dir.

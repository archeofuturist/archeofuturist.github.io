Even the scrawniest private-schooled never-got-in-a-real-fight boy will have, by simple encounter with reality at any level, a greater understanding of violence than a woman. Not just what makes it frightening but what often makes it legitimately alluring, and not wrongly so. Young men have gone off to war for hundreds of thousands of years and come back warning against it for just as long and somehow simultaneously grasp that both perspectives are correct. Man has a mythos for, and codified honor of, violence that intertwines it to our beings in ways we often rarely appreciate or even fully understand.<br><br>Women do not have this. Not biologically and not through experience. Combat is a separate world to women. It exists in another universe and you can tell by the way the modern women both regards violence at the grand scale and engages in it at the interpersonal scale that she has conceived of no respect for it. All at once she denounces it in all its forms and yet behaves as though it is inconceivable that it would ever happen to her irrespective of her choices in life - often enough she is correct, and utterly shell-shocked otherwise. No man, not even the most pozzed numale Feminist with his carefully quieted mind, ever fully escapes the disturbing tenor roused in him when he watches his female counterparts engage in violence or offer their quaint perspectives on it. Every man on Earth has felt relief at some point that women have been stuck in such physically frail bodies.<br><br>So when they think about going off to be big bad grrrls in the army, it&#039;s sort of like how your history teacher in grade 8 told you that people went prancing off to WWI expecting to just breeze down some Germans and then waltz back home in a few months.

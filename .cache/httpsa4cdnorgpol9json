Missouri Compromise). The South were massively democratic, and being such staunchly opposed the Republican north, seeing as the republicans wanted to stop the expansion of slavery, and really it was kickstarted by Lincolns election. Seeing how Lincoln got little to no support in the south and if my memory serves him right he won no southern states. Southerners had already threatened to secede if he was elected. They also felt after the election that disunion was their only option, feeling they were losing representation and felt that their rights were being stomped on. Then when the southern states seceded and that in my opinion marks the start of civil war. I personally would argue that it was more about preservation of the union than the abolition of slavery, seeing how an independent south would add to increased tensions over trade, land right etc. Though I believe slavery played in important role. Seeing how much support Lincoln got from abolitionists, also we need not forget how Lincoln opposed slavery, even arguing that blacks should have the right to vote after the war during reconstruction, which coincidentally led to his assassination. So in summary it was more about states right in the south and preservation of the union in north.","time":1493789230,"resto":123869720,"id":"D8tRbfUb","country":"US","country_name":"United States"}]},{"posts":[{"no":123873439,"now":"05\/03\/17(Wed)00:53:14","name":"Anonymous","sub":"is \/pol\/ ever just fucking happy","com":"yes I get it being red pilled is realizing the massive flaws with society and race.

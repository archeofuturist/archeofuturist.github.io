Accepting religion is the exact same thing as being tolerant of trannies who claim to be made-up genders, or otherkins, or whatever other bullshit they believe. It&#039;s complete nonsense that holds 0 scientific credibility. Why should I play along with Hindus, Jews, Muslims, etc, when, again, it&#039;s obviously fake? No, fuck off, you creepy, preachy cunt. I&#039;m not going to tolerate it.<br><br>Religion does not deserve some special magic reason to be &#039;accepted&#039;, just because some mentally ill retards think it&#039;s real (again, like trannies). Shit like Mormonism, Scientology, Paganism, etc, is a straight up insult to every person with a working brain. It is nothing but anti-intellectualism, lies, manipulation, degeneracy, and I strongly advocate for religion to be banned.<br><br>Jews and Muslims are the absolute worst people in the world. They are the root everything bad in the world today. They are murders, they are oppressive, they mutilate their children, the list goes on to a million other things. Their creepy cults are a disgrace and burden to all of humanity, and they absolutely must be stopped by force. They have 0 evidence or genuine logical reasons to justify the pain and suffering they caused to so many millions. They are true psychopaths. <br><br>The only people I can accept are &quot;cultural Christians (or -whatever religion you are-)&quot;, because those people acknowledge that all religion is (factually) tradition\/myth, and therefore they don&#039;t take any baseless special snowflake beliefs seriously. Scientific evidence of deism is also fine with me, but that&#039;s it.<br><br>And don&#039;t dare try and paint non-religious people as fedora wearers or uncool. Religion isn&#039;t cool. It&#039;s an abomination. If you joined religion to escape from atheism you have the same mindset as teenagers and tumblrtards who reject logic and reason for degeneracy and LGBQWR trends.","filename":"anger","ext":".jpg","w":640,"h":480,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":187,"tim":1493948947608,"time":1493948947,"md5":"7XnbhuebwIe\/\/IahXMeQ3g==","fsize":38824,"resto":0,"id":"Wb6cUY3x","country":"GB","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"anti-religion-thread","country_name":"United Kingdom","replies":1,"images":0},{"no":124147040,"now":"05\/04\/17(Thu)21:50:22","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p124146861\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;124146861<\/a><br>BECAUSE THE WHOLE WEST IS BASED ON CHRISTIAN VALUES AND IF YOU CAN&#039;T SEE THAT YOU ARE BLIND<br><br>GO READ SOME CRIME AND PUNISHMENT NOT MY JOB TO EDUCATE YOU SHITLORD","time":1493949022,"resto":124146861,"id":"RHAB0cd4","country":"US","country_name":"United States"}]},{"posts":[{"no":124142361,"now":"05\/04\/17(Thu)21:12:40","name":"Anonymous","com":"What did he mean by this?","filename":"trump","ext":".jpg","w":750,"h":500,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":166,"tim":1493946760246,"time":1493946760,"md5":"+s8pUO4Aw8\/xCtz0a79noA==","fsize":91174,"resto":0,"id":"rLhUYt0m","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"what-did-he-mean-by-this","country_name":"United States","replies":16,"images":3,"omitted_posts":11,"omitted_images":2},{"no":124146211,"now":"05\/04\/17(Thu)21:43:50","name":"Anonymous","com":"He&#039;s just trying to make us canucks jealous, but we all know we are America&#039;s true greatest ally (after Israel of course)","time":1493948630,"resto":124142361,"id":"42Gm59pj","country":"CA","country_name":"Canada"},{"no":124146408,"now":"05\/04\/17(Thu)21:45:36","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p124142361\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;124142361<\/a><br>He kept the Australian PM waiting 3 hours because he was so busy celebrating the repeal of Obamacare.","time":1493948736,"resto":124142361,"id":"Dx9CpdO7","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":124146615,"now":"05\/04\/17(Thu)21:47:08","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p124142361\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;124142361<\/a><br>He wants a bloomin onion and some vegemite","time":1493948828,"resto":124142361,"id":"Iac7SGQ0","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":124146817,"now":"05\/04\/17(Thu)21:48:49","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p124145906\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;124145906<\/a><br>look man, you really gotta chill. i know she&#039;s your girl, we just wanted to hangout, maybe see a movie or something<br><br>just chill bro","time":1493948929,"resto":124142361,"id":"scjjAwrA","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":124146974,"now":"05\/04\/17(Thu)21:49:58","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p124142361\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;124142361<\/a><br>Lies.

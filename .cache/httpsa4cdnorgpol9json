The following question remains unanswered: Why is it that 5,000 units of our currency is worth one unit of your currency, when we are the ones with the actual gold reserves?<\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;It\u2019s quite evident that the aid is in fact not coming from the West to Africa, but from Africa to the Western world. The Western world depends on Africa in every possible way<\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;We all know the dollar is worthless, while the euro is merely charged with German intellect and technology, and maybe some Italian pasta.<\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;It\u2019s super sweet of you to come with your colored paper in exchange for our gold and diamonds. But instead, you should come empty-handed, filled with integrity and honor. We want to share with you our wealth and invite you to share with us. The perception is that a healthy and striving Africawould not disperse its resources as freely and cheaply. Which is logical. Of course. It would instead sell its resources at world market prices, which in turn would destabilize and weaken Western economies, established on the post-colonial free meal system.<\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Former French president Jaques Chirac stated in an interview recently that we have to be honest and acknowledge that a big part of the money in our banks comes precisely from the exploitation of the African continent.

In the world we have created. Have you ever wondered how things work in nature? One would assume that in evolution the fittest survives.

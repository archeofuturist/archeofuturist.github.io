Fast food joints and Coffee shop space demands are increasing as less and less people cook for themselves. Go into any coffee shop at midday lunch hour and its packed. One of the easiest ways to increase space is to condense the relatively large bathroom facilities they are often legally required to provide. <br><br>A trend with gender neutral bathrooms I&#039;ve noticed is that they are the old disabled toilets with a new sign. All your disabled, male, and female customers are going to be covered by one tiny part of the store. This covers all their obligations and allows for on average 20 extra seats. Milage may vary depends on the toilets they had before. <br><br>There was a metric shitload of work over the last few years for my construction firm. These places would hre us to knock down the walls and remove the utilities so that the current seating areas became enlarged. Was a massive earner for us and others I&#039;m sure. <br><br>When you see bullshit notices about a store being &#039;progressive&#039; and adopting &#039;gender neutrality&#039; promoting bathrooms don&#039;t fool for it. It&#039;s nothing more than a ploy to shut up anyone that might be annoyed that there is at least 1 3rd less of the facilities than before. After all - you&#039;re a cis gendered bigoted hate-monger if you don&#039;t want to have to wait in a queue to share a single facility that is currently being defiled by the trigglypuff you politely allowed to skip ahead of you due to chivalrous etiquette. <br><br>I don&#039;t really care either way, I very very rarely ever go to a coffee shop or a fast food restaurant and there is no major work shortage on my end, but if you guys were to voice your concerns I&#039;d be grateful as it&#039;d be hilarious to reinstall all that plumbing.","time":1490871968,"resto":118887823,"id":"bAglLAfi","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":118911621,"now":"03\/30\/17(Thu)07:20:21","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a

Japanese slaves are believed to be the first of their nation to end up in Europe, and the Portuguese purchased large numbers of Japanese slave girls to bring to Portugal for sexual purposes, as noted by the Church[citation needed]in 1555.

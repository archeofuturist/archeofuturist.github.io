So, expect not just obscure in-jokes, but byzantine labyrinths of buzzwords; not just preening, but an odd sort of \u201cvirtue-signaling\u201d in which what a given troll seeks to signal is that he isless\u201cpolitically correct\u201d than everyone else and therefore more (as he will see it) \u201ccourageously subversive\u201d; not just references to pop culture, but citations of those obscure sub-dungeons of pop culture which only an initiate into the most esoteric cubbyholes of the digital age could ever grok.<br><br>whatever.... <br>here the news.. <br>https:\/\/medium.com\/@Seth_Abramson\/l<wbr>isten-up-progressives-heres-how-to-<wbr>deal-with-a-4chan-alt-right-troll-4<wbr>8594f59a303","time":1493816120,"resto":123909090,"id":"Dnm2gsFs","country":"US","country_name":"United States"}]},{"posts":[{"no":123909011,"now":"05\/03\/17(Wed)08:50:00","name":"Anonymous","com":"Stop gaslighting black people https:\/\/youtu.be\/5fuIDbR_-mw","filename":"image","ext":".png","w":750,"h":1334,"tn_w":140,"tn_h":249,"tim":1493815800659,"time":1493815800,"md5":"cH4mneT+b7xFIUFLS\/gF\/w==","fsize":1361611,"resto":0,"id":"knZ\/+4eh","country":"US","m_img":1,"bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"stop-gaslighting-black-people","country_name":"United States","replies":2,"images":0},{"no":123909081,"now":"05\/03\/17(Wed)08:51:06","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123909011\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123909011<\/a><br>how else are you to heat up the ovens?","time":1493815866,"resto":123909011,"id":"k88NLRyK","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":123909220,"now":"05\/03\/17(Wed)08:52:59","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123909011\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123909011<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Her hair<\/span><br>Disgusting","time":1493815979,"resto":123909011,"id":"V0NzT9b1","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"}]},{"posts":[{"no":123909035,"now":"05\/03\/17(Wed)08:50:26","name":"Anonymous","sub":"Post lefty memes","filename":"18199113_10155673010380016_4041692974732283074_n","ext":".jpg","w":538,"h":906,"tn_w":148,"tn_h":250,"tim":1493815826964,"time":1493815826,"md5":"1314zN3jRCyY6izcKnnRjg==","fsize":157903,"resto":0,"id":"NY+4O+YZ","country":"GB","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"post-lefty-memes","country_name":"United Kingdom","replies":3,"images":1},{"no":123909124,"now":"05\/03\/17(Wed)08:51:46","name":"Anonymous","com":"No","time":1493815906,"resto":123909035,"id":"tCnQFh6S","country":"BG","country_name":"Bulgaria"},{"no":123909181,"now":"05\/03\/17(Wed)08:52:29","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123909035\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123909035<\/a>","filename":"gooddaysir","ext":".jpg","w":600,"h":800,"tn_w":93,"tn_h":125,"tim":1493815949137,"time":1493815949,"md5":"jXsLopvukvv9WjawcZa0RA==","fsize":80224,"resto":123909035,"id":"JDK49Yo5","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":123909326,"now":"05\/03\/17(Wed)08:54:13","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123909124\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123909124<\/a><br>But look at how far behind they are.

You must be successful, reliable, hardworking, and, above all, happy. Do people in your life trust and respect you? What does your family think of you? Are you capable of raising children? Racial politics doesn\u2019t have to be the only factor of your life. And if you can&#039;t achieve these things in your real life, then you are not ready to be a political activist, either online or in real life. Because if you can&#039;t make anything of your own, individual life, then how can you think you&#039;ll be able to make a real difference for the race, for the lives of many?<br><br>Always remember: we live in first world countries and have opportunity that most people born on this planet don&#039;t. Things aren\u2019t as good for us as they were for our parents. But billions of people in the third world would still kill to have the opportunity that you do right now. So take care of yourself! Work your ass off, every day, to build a good life for you, and for your family. Spend your time wisely, and keep your real life priorities in order. Work hard, but also do fun and wholesome things with real people in real life. That is very important.

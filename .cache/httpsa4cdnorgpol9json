I&#039;ve been watching a lot of Moly lately; and, although I enjoy a lot of his content, the guy is pretty clearly fucked up. A few of the things I&#039;ve noticed: <br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;sometimes he starts &quot;acting&quot; in a very clear and bizarre manner, like he&#039;ll start swaying and speaking in a different voice; usually this happens when he&#039;s talking about some grand historical concept or something he&#039;s really serious about, like parenting. <\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;constantly, and I mean constantly, bringing up how young he was when he did intellectual shit. I&#039;ve heard of all the times he skipped his recess to study programming whe nhe was 12 at least six or seven times, and he&#039;s constantly describing how old he was when he read various authors and philosophies. <\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;constantly and aggressive describing his show as a &quot;philosophy show&quot;, which it isn&#039;t; clearly the program is a current events\/news and politics show which he tries to pass off as &#039;philosophy&#039; because he&#039;s deranged. <\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;insane inability to take criticism. Go watch that episode with Fritz or whatever his name is to answer this. <\/span><br><br>So anybody on \/pol\/ an armchair psycologist? What the fuck is this guy&#039;s problem and how do we fix him so that one of the most popular youtubers who addresses our issues (race realism, general right wing ideology, etc) doesn&#039;t come off as a fucking raging lunatic to any outside observer. I know I&#039;d be embarrassed to link an impartial outsider a Moly video, even if I did strongly agree with the content.","filename":"maxresdefault (3)","ext":".jpg","w":1159,"h":736,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":158,"tim":1492613340801,"time":1492613340,"md5":"g4+vjwpk0JfB0g4vG5A7Cg==","fsize":47985,"resto":0,"id":"VjSTB2FH","country":"CA","m_img":1,"bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"lets-diagnose-stefan-molyneux-with-the","country_name":"Canada","replies":2,"images":0},{"no":121852807,"now":"04\/19\/17(Wed)11:01:39","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121851471\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121851471<\/a><br>obviously he has problems with his family relations (thus his defoo)<br>He seems to have especial aversion to his jew mother","time":1492614099,"resto":121851471,"id":"pyKyKe8Z","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":121853046,"now":"04\/19\/17(Wed)11:03:46","name":"Anonymous","com":"Schizoid personality disorder<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt; Affected individuals may be unable to form intimate attachments to others and simultaneously demonstrate a rich, elaborate and exclusively internal fantasy world.<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt; narcissism<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt; a sense of superiority<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt; preoccupation with fantasy and introspection<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt; indifference to social norms and conventions<\/span>","time":1492614226,"resto":121851471,"id":"fCqkZi+Y","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"}]},{"posts":[{"no":121848553,"now":"04\/19\/17(Wed)10:21:02","name":"idos","sub":"4CHAN ATTACK","com":"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=NvL<wbr>ssV_Bl3A","filename":"message","ext":".png","w":912,"h":653,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":179,"tim":1492611662406,"time":1492611662,"md5":"0Xtfk6IUXDm15hv5yuyn+w==","fsize":730866,"resto":0,"id":"cDg\/5eP8","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"4chan-attack","country_name":"United States","replies":16,"images":4,"omitted_posts":11,"omitted_images":4},{"no":121849752,"now":"04\/19\/17(Wed)10:33:09","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121848553\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121848553<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;&quot;and, if they think they can be weaponized autism they&#039;re gonna get BTFO&quot;<\/span><br><br>holy fuck who is this retard","filename":"whenthecringeistoostrong","ext":".jpg","w":320,"h":220,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":85,"tim":1492612389906,"time":1492612389,"md5":"IlHKX8tjjhF90UmPcle+sw==","fsize":19306,"resto":121848553,"id":"\/7fua3jp","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":121850675,"now":"04\/19\/17(Wed)10:42:16","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121848723\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121848723<\/a><br>That one Jewish divorce lawyer (and spouse)","time":1492612936,"resto":121848553,"id":"RAkZQApf","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":121851558,"now":"04\/19\/17(Wed)10:49:49","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121848553\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121848553<\/a><br><br>gonna start my blog to reblog infowarz and earth flat teories.","time":1492613389,"resto":121848553,"id":"3SdMbkkz","country":"MX","country_name":"Mexico"},{"no":121852547,"now":"04\/19\/17(Wed)10:59:10","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121848723\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121848723<\/a><br>this<br>also<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;unironically saying &quot;weaponized autism&quot;<\/span>","filename":"543143_3621928085736_831815643_n","ext":".jpg","w":480,"h":640,"tn_w":93,"tn_h":125,"tim":1492613950009,"time":1492613950,"md5":"dzZfJZDiEkkdjus2qx8i4w==","fsize":29317,"resto":121848553,"id":"TRnFMLSc","country":"HR","country_name":"Croatia"},{"no":121853043,"now":"04\/19\/17(Wed)11:03:47","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121849462\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121849462<\/a><br>i&#039;m sorry that autism makes it hard to get sarcasm, anon","time":1492614227,"resto":121848553,"id":"O\/l93oAO","country":"US","country_name":"United States"}]},{"posts":[{"no":121847857,"now":"04\/19\/17(Wed)10:12:54","name":"Anonymous","com":"Press S to shart on grave","filename":"IMG_1546","ext":".jpg","w":3000,"h":2200,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":183,"tim":1492611174864,"time":1492611174,"md5":"9gBLqwyiDZnyH261BQjtHg==","fsize":2602103,"resto":0,"id":"jsJmzCZA","country":"US","m_img":1,"bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"press-s-to-shart-on-grave","country_name":"United States","replies":29,"images":2,"omitted_posts":24,"omitted_images":1},{"no":121851676,"now":"04\/19\/17(Wed)10:50:53","name":"Anonymous","com":"S","time":1492613453,"resto":121847857,"id":"2+iTLc3f","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":121851719,"now":"04\/19\/17(Wed)10:51:13","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121851607\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121851607<\/a><br>Ah, okay.

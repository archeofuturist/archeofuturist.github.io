A man who feels he has no responsibilities to other people, or has already failed in his responsibilities to his family (usually financial) is no longer worried about what impact his death will have on other people. For him, the worst has already come to pass. <br><br>Women tend to see their social responsibilities in a different light, involving day to day caretaking and providing emotional support. Therefore, women are less likely to commit suicide, because they fear the consequences. They tend to worry more about how their death will impact children, parents, lovers, etc. No longer being present as a caretaker and betraying those emotional bonds would be the greatest failure of social responsibility for a woman. <br><br>The second issue is that less women are comfortable using firearms, hanging, other other methods involving tools or weapons. You may laugh, but it is true. Many women have simply never learned to use them the way men have, and therefore feel they have less options,s o to speak.<br><br>Men who commit suicide are also reported as acting out of anger (they want to prove a point, hurt someone, or leave a mess for people to clean up) and anger can be very motivating. Women who are suicidal are more prone to depressive behaviors, which tend to be passive and involve not wanting to be noticed and avoiding conflict.<br><br>This just reflects the general trends. there are exceptions to every rule.<br><br>My mother, for instance, grew up hunting, and was very comfortable with firearms. She committed suicide by shooting herself in the throat and bled out in less than a minute. She did this after leavig a note that basically was a giant &quot;Fuck You&quot; to everyone she knew.<br><br>So not everyone follows the trends, but in general, there are patterns that explain why more men commit suicide than women.","time":1491843744,"resto":120454390,"id":"hlIdb1P9","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":120458959,"now":"04\/10\/17(Mon)13:03:33","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120454390\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120454390<\/a><br>feminism<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;i wanna do what men do!<\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;where are all the real men to do what i dont want to do?<\/span>","time":1491843813,"resto":120454390,"id":"xIF1Ohnw","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":120459009,"now":"04\/10\/17(Mon)13:04:07","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120455790\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120455790<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Committing suicide and ending it all<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Not slowly poisoning yourself with the fermented jew<\/span><br>Is functional alcoholism the ultimate redpill?","filename":"images(22)","ext":".jpg","w":342,"h":431,"tn_w":99,"tn_h":125,"tim":1491843847036,"time":1491843847,"md5":"PBxHyQWZ\/WvzIc1L2\/RLVw==","fsize":21654,"resto":120454390,"id":"oDCGQF9O","country":"MX","country_name":"Mexico"},{"no":120459362,"now":"04\/10\/17(Mon)13:07:37","name":"SAGE","com":"<a href=\"#p120454390\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120454390<\/a><br>because life is easier for females","time":1491844057,"resto":120454390,"id":"Sa45CsR3","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":120460138,"now":"04\/10\/17(Mon)13:15:00","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120454390\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120454390<\/a><br>same reason male salaries are higher","filename":"1490272725621","ext":".jpg","w":2431,"h":3000,"tn_w":101,"tn_h":125,"tim":1491844500937,"time":1491844500,"md5":"9ysdWH8Ke75SVNHqa\/sg6Q==","fsize":1115599,"resto":120454390,"id":"tsRUON61","country":"US","m_img":1,"country_name":"United States"}]},{"posts":[{"no":120459811,"now":"04\/10\/17(Mon)13:11:47","name":"Anonymous","com":"Face it, they won","filename":"Bow","ext":".jpg","w":259,"h":194,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":187,"tim":1491844307163,"time":1491844307,"md5":"1XxXYmPwgWEc8QuQbZr2LA==","fsize":6213,"resto":0,"id":"Sg7QLv3v","country":"NZ","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"face-it-they-won","country_name":"New Zealand","replies":1,"images":0},{"no":120460111,"now":"04\/10\/17(Mon)13:14:47","name":"Anonymous","com":"The secret is they never lost.

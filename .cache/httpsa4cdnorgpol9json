New York magazine\u2019s The Cut website described the Tinder crowd as \u201csingle people who hang out at bars,\u201d and it\u2019s become known for facilitating hookups and last-minute dates among those in their 20s and 30s. To enter a bar, however, you usually have to be 21; the age of admission to Tinder is just 13\u2014and Alyssa\u2019s hardly the only teen on the app. The company won\u2019t reveal its exact number of users, but it did disclose that 2.5 percent are people ages 13 to 17. If you do the math based on a late-2014 story in The New York Times, which reported that the app had nearly 50 million active users at the time, you\u2019re left with well over a million users under 18 on the platform.<br><br>As a precaution, minors on Tinder can see only other minors. \u201cWe want people to be safe,\u201d says Rosette Pambakian, Tinder\u2019s vice president of global communica- tions and branding. \u201cIf you\u2019re not lying about your age, we\u2019re not showing you 40-year-olds.\u201d Still, teens can easily circum- vent this hurdle by lying about their age on Facebook, which is how Tinder authenticates new users (the minimum age to join Facebook is 13). That\u2019s what Alyssa did and how she ended up listed as 18. \u201cA lot of kids do that,\u201d she admits. As a result, she saw men as old as 50.

Even if you used high energy RF to ionize the molecules in the atmosphere, the atmosphere is moving and flowing in a way you cannot control.","time":1492403045,"resto":121463505,"id":"GG3y5XFY","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":121479614,"now":"04\/17\/17(Mon)00:33:29","name":"Anonymous","com":"bane?","time":1492403609,"resto":121463505,"id":"PxwIijpS","country":"AR","country_name":"Argentina"},{"no":121479700,"now":"04\/17\/17(Mon)00:34:18","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121463505\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121463505<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;mfw they can actually shut down the atoms<\/span>","filename":"1466984831980","ext":".png","w":510,"h":332,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":81,"tim":1492403658973,"time":1492403658,"md5":"vlqyHwNIxTIVVTJ2RjGbFQ==","fsize":67301,"resto":121463505,"id":"8VW6lg7y","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":121480190,"now":"04\/17\/17(Mon)00:38:53","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121478695\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121478695<\/a><br>What if the area surrounding the ion beam is laced with anti-matter, imitating the vacuum of space?","time":1492403933,"resto":121463505,"id":"Wq+eonAD","country":"US","country_name":"United States"}]},{"posts":[{"no":121477514,"now":"04\/17\/17(Mon)00:13:21","name":"Anonymous","com":"Is degeneracy really that bad?","filename":"apeofnaples","ext":".png","w":650,"h":597,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":229,"tim":1492402401743,"time":1492402401,"md5":"CiF2f+p8\/hqmyus8eQXw5A==","fsize":146596,"resto":0,"id":"wLZtP3iu","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"is-degeneracy-really-that-bad","country_name":"United States","replies":4,"images":0},{"no":121477918,"now":"04\/17\/17(Mon)00:16:34","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121477514\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121477514<\/a><br>Truth is more interesting than degeneracy","time":1492402594,"resto":121477514,"id":"lPr81moQ","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":121479156,"now":"04\/17\/17(Mon)00:28:58","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121477918\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121477918<\/a><br>good point","time":1492403338,"resto":121477514,"id":"wLZtP3iu","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":121479702,"now":"04\/17\/17(Mon)00:34:19","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121477514\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121477514<\/a><br>A little degeneracy is necessary to move society forward.

You will NEVER convince them with rational debate, or with some logical and clever meme. The time for reasoned discussion is OVER. Trump supporters have a legal and constitutional right to hold rallies, marches, etc., but anyone who shows up thinking the police will protect them are NAIVE. If you&#039;re stupid enough to show up to a Trump rally and not have a gun, or at least SOME means of protecting yourself from rabid leftists, then sorry to say but you KINDA deserve whats coming to you.

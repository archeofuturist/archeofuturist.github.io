All public knowledge of the attack indicates a false flag - but Trump may be sitting on undeniable evidence.<br><br>HOWEVER - it&#039;s irrelevant whether it&#039;s true or not in the grand scheme of things.<br><br>And this is why:<br>1. If it wasn&#039;t a false flag he responded appropriately. All he did was bomb an airfield - targeting aircraft and infrastructure while avoiding personnel - after warning the Russians. No Russian casualties = No WWIII. Currently conflicting reports on SAA casualties. Doesn&#039;t matter. By targeting the air base and not Assad&#039;s headquarters (like Libya) he demonstrated this had NOTHING to do with regime change. Just sending a message. (Also, the way he was silent about this shit until the attack was pretty cool. It&#039;s what a President ought to do. Don&#039;t run your mouth, just do what needs to be done. That ought to scare the shit out of any other country.)<br><br>2. He just put Assad in check while sedating Neo-Cons like McCain, and Israel (who are the people who would have supported the false flag). He&#039;s winning over support from people stonewalling him with a glorified firework show.<br><br>3. He&#039;s being tough on China and North Korea. He was meeting with the leader of China today. By pulling the trigger unannounced like this he&#039;s showing he&#039;s not fucking around with North Korea. No doubt a message to Iran as well.<br><br>4. Even if Syrian forces are grounded they still have Russian air support. Essentially nothing has changed strategically speaking.<br><br>5. The momentary salt of some of his supporters will fade as the hysteria dies down when it&#039;s seen as it is - truly nothing of significance.<br><br>6. Another nail in the coffin for the Russian collusion narrative.","filename":"sa on syria","ext":".png","w":758,"h":548,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":90,"tim":1491578688567,"time":1491578688,"md5":"bGNi65w5zHqLKhbaC7i49Q==","fsize":69912,"resto":119952531,"id":"ZsHk7o4R","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":119965942,"now":"04\/07\/17(Fri)11:26:16","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119965690\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119965690<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;3.<\/span><br>This is more a message to China and NK than anything else.","time":1491578776,"resto":119952531,"id":"Cgbq\/fct","country":"SE","country_name":"Sweden"},{"no":119966274,"now":"04\/07\/17(Fri)11:28:26","name":"Anonymous","com":"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=Bdn<wbr>r32H34T4","time":1491578906,"resto":119952531,"id":"Rma4FWty","country":"AU","country_name":"Australia"},{"no":119967441,"now":"04\/07\/17(Fri)11:35:19","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119953672\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119953672<\/a><br>Fuck of r\/the_donald, go suck ISIS dick if you want to help them anymore","time":1491579319,"resto":119952531,"id":"pjjKjm6l","country":"BR","country_name":"Brazil"},{"no":119967840,"now":"04\/07\/17(Fri)11:37:43","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119956552\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119956552<\/a><br>The only source are moderate beheaders.<br><br>You really think Assad would do it?

The hangings\/shootings were a minimal portion of the deaths. Most of the deaths came from disease and starvation, partly because the Allies decided to bomb Germany&#039;s industrial centers and logistics routes.","time":1491809530,"resto":120404368,"id":"v9Egr1B3","country":"US","country_name":"United States"}]},{"posts":[{"no":120408332,"now":"04\/10\/17(Mon)03:18:14","name":"Anonymous","com":"Was Trump just lying to us this whole time or is he being manipulated like a baby?<br>I can&#039;t believe this.

Twenty-five years after the former Socialist Federalist Republic of Yugoslavia was split into Serbia (which later split again to form Montenegro in 2006), Bosnia, Croatia, Slovenia, and Macedonia, a group of linguists have declared that Bosnian, Serbian, Croatian, and Montenegrin are all just versions of the same language. (Macedonian and Slovenian languages remain different.)<br><br>Before the fragmentation of Yugoslavia, citizens of the region generally spoke a language known as Serbo-Croatian. As each country gained independence, the local version of the language was renamed. But linguists now say that the roots of language commonality in the region stretch much further back than Yugoslavia. Therefore, this common language isn\u2019t being called Serbo-Croatian, and doesn\u2019t have a new name yet. While any proposed label will inevitably be the subject of heated political debate, the Balkan Insider reports that it could be called Euroslav.<br><br>This linguistic development is the result of four language conferences, each held in one of the four former Yugoslav countries being studied. On March 30, the conference participants signed a Declaration of Common Language in Sarajevo contending that all languages spoken in the Balkan states that formerly spoke Serbo-Croatian should be considered the same.<br><br>Predictably, nationalists\u2014in all of the countries involved\u2014are already criticizing this idea. Augustus Kova\u010dec, one of the region\u2019s most prominent linguists, called the declaration \u201cvague and unnecessary,\u201d and labeled it a provocation (link in Croatian). Members of the Croatian government seem to agree: The culture minister and prime minister warned that creating a comma language could undermine the self-determination of individual Balkan states and related it back to the artificial unity imposed under Tito\u2019s regime.","filename":"greatermacedonia","ext":".png","w":904,"h":768,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":212,"tim":1491807256332,"time":1491807256,"md5":"0vFMkHc4kWFhSfHNiupD3A==","fsize":54374,"resto":0,"id":"zp76czmZ","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"linguists-say-most-balkan-languages-are-the-same","country_name":"United States","replies":6,"images":1,"omitted_posts":1,"omitted_images":1},{"no":120408120,"now":"04\/10\/17(Mon)03:15:27","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120406496\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120406496<\/a><br>Yes they are, Bosnian, Serbian, Croatian, and Montenegrin are certainly the same language with minor differences, Bulgarian and Macedonian are the same language with different accent, Russian and Belorussian and Ukrainian are the same, etc.","time":1491808527,"resto":120406496,"id":"dO8Ne6gg","country":"BG","country_name":"Bulgaria"},{"no":120408221,"now":"04\/10\/17(Mon)03:16:47","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120408120\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120408120<\/a><br>So if you visited Skopje and spoke in your native Bulgarian, they would understand every word?","time":1491808607,"resto":120406496,"id":"zp76czmZ","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":120408389,"now":"04\/10\/17(Mon)03:19:00","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120408221\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120408221<\/a><br>Of course, it&#039;s easier for me to understand Macedonian then some dialects from northwest Bulgaria.

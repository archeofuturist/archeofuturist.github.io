Drawing on the authors&#039; deep knowledge of Hillary from their previous book, the acclaimed biography HRC, Shattered will offer an object lesson in how Hillary herself made victory an uphill battle, how her difficulty articulating a vision irreparably hobbled her impact with voters, and how the campaign failed to internalize the lessons of populist fury from the hard-fought primary against Bernie Sanders.<\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Moving blow-by-blow from the campaign&#039;s difficult birth through the bewildering terror of election night, Shattered tells an unforgettable story with urgent lessons both political and personal, filled with revelations that will change the way readers understand just what happened to America on November 8, 2016.<\/span><br><br>Basically a book about HRC getting Schlonged very Big League and probably a hilarious read for any \/pol\/fags.

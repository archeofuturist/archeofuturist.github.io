Atheism is in decline worldwide, with the number of atheists falling from 4.5% of the world&#039;s population in 1970 to 2.0% in 2010 and projected to drop to 1.8% by 2020, <br><br>Real surveys and statistics say atheism is on the decline worldwide. Sorry atheists but atheism is not on the rise nor is it winning. It&#039;s still the minority and a declining one at that. <br><br>The Pew Research Center&#039;s statistics show that atheism is expected to continue to decline all the way into 2050 with a continued growth of religion. Other research also shows a huge surge in growth for Christianity in China which is currently the world&#039;s most &quot;atheist&quot; nation because of the atheist communist government suppressing religion, the research suggests that China will soon become the world&#039;s most Christian nation within 15 years. <br><br>This is simply history repeating itself: Christianity prospered in Rome back in the ancient era when it was suppressed and it still grew in the militant atheist soviet Russia when it was suppressed there only a century ago with the majority of Russians today now also identifying as Christian. Just goes to show that atheist suppression of religion still doesn&#039;t stop religion.<br><br>Sources for the legion of whiny \/Redditor\/ fedoras that will no doubt show up it this thread:<br><br>http:\/\/www.pewforum.org\/2015\/04\/02\/<wbr>religious-projections-2010-2050\/<br>http:\/\/www.pewforum.org\/2012\/12\/18\/<wbr>global-religious-landscape-unaffili<wbr>ated\/<br>http:\/\/www.telegraph.co.uk\/news\/wor<wbr>ldnews\/asia\/china\/10776023\/China-on<wbr>-course-to-become-worlds-most-Chris<wbr>tian-nation-within-15-years.html<br>http:\/\/masterrussian.com\/russia\/fac<wbr>ts.htm","filename":"1488223422556","ext":".png","w":264,"h":200,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":189,"tim":1493656303230,"time":1493656303,"md5":"CZeJ6Dns1Hdbc+F3CtMj9A==","fsize":276085,"resto":0,"id":"JULOVyDM","country":"PL","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"atheism-is-the-fastest-shrinking-religion-in-the","country_name":"Poland","replies":0,"images":0}]},{"posts":[{"no":123638231,"now":"05\/01\/17(Mon)12:19:54","name":"Anonymous","sub":"We Japanese liberals support Abe","filename":"1485403036513","ext":".jpg","w":300,"h":273,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":227,"tim":1493655594615,"time":1493655594,"md5":"OPAZvsW86n0+7AdlZ8uCpA==","fsize":15187,"resto":0,"id":"lwH1Jv8O","country":"JP","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"we-japanese-liberals-support-abe","country_name":"Japan","replies":6,"images":1,"omitted_posts":1,"omitted_images":0},{"no":123638789,"now":"05\/01\/17(Mon)12:25:25","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123638231\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123638231<\/a><br>Who doesn&#039;t?","time":1493655925,"resto":123638231,"id":"25BauOVD","country":"DE","country_name":"Germany"},{"no":123638793,"now":"05\/01\/17(Mon)12:25:30","name":"Anonymous","com":"Abe is centre-right, sometimes centre-left.","time":1493655930,"resto":123638231,"id":"e98QRBMk","country":"JP","country_name":"Japan"},{"no":123638928,"now":"05\/01\/17(Mon)12:26:52","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123638231\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123638231<\/a><br>What&#039;s with these colonial american names in japan lol<br><br>Your president better get along with putin senpai","time":1493656012,"resto":123638231,"id":"9YufPZt+","country":"CA","country_name":"Canada"},{"no":123639191,"now":"05\/01\/17(Mon)12:29:32","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123638231\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123638231<\/a><br>He seemed like a nice guy when he was in London doing some speech.<br><br>I","time":1493656172,"resto":123638231,"id":"GlNLKY37","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":123639376,"now":"05\/01\/17(Mon)12:31:23","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123638928\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123638928<\/a><br>\u5b89\u500d = Abe<br>We can see the first Abe in the 10th century in Japanese history","time":1493656283,"resto":123638231,"id":"e98QRBMk","country":"JP","country_name":"Japan"}]},{"posts":[{"no":123636763,"now":"05\/01\/17(Mon)12:05:12","name":"Anonymous","com":"<span class=\"quote\">&gt;campaigns against income inequality<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;receives $400,000 for a speech to wall-street<\/span><br><br>What did Obama mean by this ?","filename":"obama_speech","ext":".png","w":925,"h":865,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":233,"tim":1493654712542,"time":1493654712,"md5":"V3iE1V9\/J61tpzz0Vp25jw==","fsize":437447,"resto":0,"id":"RDU8k\/jS","country":"CA","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"campaigns-against-income-inequality","country_name":"Canada","replies":9,"images":4,"omitted_posts":4,"omitted_images":1},{"no":123637988,"now":"05\/01\/17(Mon)12:17:37","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123636763\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123636763<\/a><br>what a uncle tom","filename":"fatbama","ext":".png","w":133,"h":142,"tn_w":117,"tn_h":125,"tim":1493655457885,"time":1493655457,"md5":"6PJmwUdtg2YNNvF+KuTqYQ==","fsize":25100,"resto":123636763,"id":"iNKNtlle","country":"RO","country_name":"Romania"},{"no":123638142,"now":"05\/01\/17(Mon)12:18:59","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123637988\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123637988<\/a><br>There is literally nothing wrong with being an Uncle Tom.

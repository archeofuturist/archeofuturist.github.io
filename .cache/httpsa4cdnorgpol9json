Kay Ivey is set to sign legislation that would enable taxpayer-funded adoption agencies to deny placement to LGBT families out of religious objections.<br><br>The legislation, known as House Bill 24, is titled the \u201cChild Placing Agency Inclusion Act,\u201d but instead of encouraging child placement would permit agencies to deny placement of children into LGBT households. The bill was approved by the Senate on Wednesday by a 23-9 vote and by the House in March by a 60-14 vote.<br><br>The stated purpose of the bill is to \u201cprohibit the state from discriminating against child placing agencies\u201d if declining to place a child with a family \u201cconflicts with the religious beliefs of the provider.\u201d<br><br>Rep. Rich Wingo (R-Tuscaloosa), the sponsor of the bill, was quoted in AL.com in February as saying the measure is necessary to uphold \u201creligious freedom.\u201d<br><br>\u201cThis bill is not about prohibiting gay and lesbian couples from adopting or fostering a child,\u201d Wingo is quoted as saying. \u201cIt\u2019s about protecting and not discriminating against faith-based agencies that, due to their religious beliefs, could have their right to choose where to place a child taken away from them.\u201d<br><br>Many child placement agencies are faith-based organizations, such as Catholic adoption agencies, but the new law makes no distinction between agencies that are religious or otherwise affiliated. However, the bill wouldn\u2019t apply to agencies that receive federal funding.<br><br>Other states with laws allowing adoption agencies to deny placement to LGBT households are Michigan, South Dakota, North Dakota and Virginia. South Dakota Gov. Dennis Daugaard signed the anti-LGBT adoption law in his state in March, marking the first time this year an anti-LGBT measure became law.","filename":"adoption","ext":".jpg","w":700,"h":525,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":187,"tim":1492721176864,"time":1492721176,"md5":"DAe83IVkLH+VJMNye0Mobg==","fsize":147373,"resto":0,"id":"jvsp10W8","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"gays-banned-from-adopting-in-alabama","country_name":"United States","replies":13,"images":2,"omitted_posts":8,"omitted_images":1},{"no":122044120,"now":"04\/20\/17(Thu)17:04:26","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122041474\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122041474<\/a><br>Good.<br>Result: less gays in Alabama, Alabama loses potential funding and potentially higher property values (fags raise property values), almost half the country hates Alabama and they suffer further like NC and its tranny bathroom bill.<br>The free market is the shit desu.","time":1492722266,"resto":122041474,"id":"YryAOKPb","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":122044210,"now":"04\/20\/17(Thu)17:05:13","name":"Anonymous","com":"How is there any political downside for us?","filename":"tjkdtyuktyuk","ext":".png","w":945,"h":601,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":79,"tim":1492722313008,"time":1492722313,"md5":"K2U3l0tganCCKIvD2POTEg==","fsize":83182,"resto":122041474,"id":"CFTZWMRQ","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":122044512,"now":"04\/20\/17(Thu)17:07:24","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122041474\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122041474<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;taxpayer-funded adoption agencies<\/span><br>For some horrible reason, i think this might be a caveat for some jews to fuck things over to enable pedophilia.<br><br>Are there non-taxpayer funded adoption agencies?","time":1492722444,"resto":122041474,"id":"hv\/dVMjM","country":"EE","country_name":"Estonia"},{"no":122044662,"now":"04\/20\/17(Thu)17:08:35","name":"Anonymous","com":"Gays will never stop getting BTFO.<br>First group to get purged regardless of whether the Commies or the Right takes power.","time":1492722515,"resto":122041474,"id":"bwTMz6T6","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":122045532,"now":"04\/20\/17(Thu)17:15:47","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122044662\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122044662<\/a><br>Even if either of those groups get into power, the gays will be killed by nature itself, due to them no longer being forced to even have a beard to cover their degeneracy, and therefore even produce minimal offspring.<br><br>If you tie your identity in any way to faggotry, you will archive nothing but defeat sooner or later.

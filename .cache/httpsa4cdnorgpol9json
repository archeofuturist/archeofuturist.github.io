Seriously learn civics and economics and learn about how insurance works. You&#039;ve got people with preexisting conditions and people who can&#039;t pay for insurance covered, that makes premiums raise. The way the ACA tried to counteract that was forcing everyone to have insurance which gives the insurers more capital to work with and reduces their overall risk. Group rates get discounted because the more people who are insured the more profitable it is. The healthy people pay in and don&#039;t receive payouts, while the sick pay in and receive payouts. Now less healthy people will be paying for shit tier coverage so the insurance companies will have to charge more to the people who are still paying in order to offset the costs of insuring people who need expensive treatments but never bought their own health insurance. <br><br>Premiums were rising like mad even when the mandate was in effect.

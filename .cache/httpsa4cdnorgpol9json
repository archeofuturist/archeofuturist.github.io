at large you guys so don&#039;t worry about that) the second is forcing genotypes upon people and basically making humans all look the exact same and then do something like put on a mask or something so you can distinguish between us ( this one would make humanity more collectivised and have general improvement overall to living conditions basically making the ideals of communism and socialism possible) the third is getting rid of what makes us human by deleting the abillity for humanity to have a subconcious or pre concious ( see wikipedia entry https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Preco<wbr>nscious ) by deleting that which our ancestors have wrought for us it would delete any preconviced notions of others and make the species more charitable as

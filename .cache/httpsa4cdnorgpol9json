However, a disturbing trend is that the quality of discussion on this board has deteriorated as people are not able to have a rational conversation on this subject but instead quickly devolve into shitflinging. You&#039;ve seen it, I&#039;ve seen it, it&#039;s clearly a fucked situation. So here is what I propose to remedy this situation:<br><br>Temporarily filter the word &quot;shill&quot; to be &quot;friend&quot;<br>Temporarily filter the word &quot;reddit&quot; to &quot;school&quot; <br><br>The filters dont have to be exact obviously but I think this would go a long to way to bringing back some actual discussion as opposed to the mindless accusations of bad faith which seem to plague every thread.

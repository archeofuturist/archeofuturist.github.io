Google Earth), draw a path from Easter Island to Giza Plateau and extend that line around the globe. You&#039;ll probably be just as astonished as I was when realizing that many of the most mysterious and famous ancient sites are aligned to that &#039;alternative equator&#039;. Located almost exactly on that Equator (within a perimeter of ~30km), you&#039;ll find: Easter Island, the Nazca Lines, Machu Pichu, Sacsayhuaman, the Oracle of Amun, Giza Plateau, Petra, Persepolis and Mohenjo-Daro. All being major archaeological\/ancient sites linked to age-old cultures, from the creators of the Moai up to the Indus-Valley-Civilization. I wonder whether the location of these sites can really be purely coincidental? I admit that some important other sites (like Stonehenge, Baalbek etc.) are not located on that line, but it still puzzles me that, along that alternative equator, we find many world famous settlements and monuments that are almost perfectly aligned over that vast distance ... <br>Please also consider this: Easter Island and Mohenjo-Daro are ~20.000 km apart, in both directions (east and west)! That&#039;s very disturbing, especially when taking into account the equatorial circumference of the Earth, which is 40,075.017 km.","time":1492640694,"resto":121899612,"id":"CyaGO5wp","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":121907287,"now":"04\/19\/17(Wed)18:25:25","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121902282\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121902282<\/a><br>So niggers couldn&#039;t steal it.","time":1492640725,"resto":121899612,"id":"YQXoRsEV","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":121908053,"now":"04\/19\/17(Wed)18:30:46","name":"Anonymous","com":"They found an almost intact preserved dinosaur and they&#039;ve cloned it.","time":1492641046,"resto":121899612,"id":"GduSfLie","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":121908955,"now":"04\/19\/17(Wed)18:37:14","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121908053\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121908053<\/a><br>Also lots of oil.

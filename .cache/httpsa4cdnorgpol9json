(The marriage is hypothetical but I don&#039;t date anyone with that idea atleast on the table, not something I&#039;m aiming for)<br><br>Lady 1: only has dated one guy who ended up abandoning her, it was long term, thus she learned not to tolerate fuck boy bullshit. Not into casual sex with strangers. Shy, enjoys puns. Quite independent but not to the point of ridiculousness like some females. Smart, very very smart. Also determined and driven. But also has some medical issues like bad migraines, and probably some depression. Very very classy. Leans abit to the left more politically how ever. <br><br>Lady 2: younger than lady 1. Do not know her as well BUT the factor putting her in this race is she is quite obsessed or infatuated with me. No effort is needed on my part. She insists I am the perfect man, (someone must&#039;ve dropped her on her head or something) and though I&#039;ve thought internally that oh this is just some little crush she&#039;s just playing, it&#039;s been 8 months and there has been no sign of her changing her mind. So my little &quot;oh she&#039;s just playing&quot; theory, has been squashed. Not going to lie, pretty damn cute as well. I feel like if I went with her I would never have to worry about loyalty or any of that jazz. Seems like she would literally fall into the stereotypical 1950s wife type loyal, obedient, and trustworthy. Key word here obedient.<br><br>So which would you choose? The classy independen, smart, but sweet and cute lady number 1 who could contribute as an equal? Or lady number 2? A lady who would fall into what ever place I put her in, little effort required and loyalty all but assured by her obsession. <br><br>Thoughts?","filename":"image","ext":".jpg","w":750,"h":1334,"tn_w":140,"tn_h":249,"tim":1493661771305,"time":1493661771,"md5":"s1u3IpXOBDjeNMu1ZFxwcw==","fsize":146997,"resto":0,"id":"hTnWpxgc","country":"US","m_img":1,"bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"help-the-younger-generation-pick-a-wife-pol","country_name":"United States","replies":2,"images":0},{"no":123650293,"now":"05\/01\/17(Mon)14:06:58","name":"Anonymous","com":"Penis sizes?","time":1493662018,"resto":123649842,"id":"Fn6o1978","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":123650533,"now":"05\/01\/17(Mon)14:09:07","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123650293\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123650293<\/a><br>No traps in sight :\/ sorry to disappoint anon","time":1493662147,"resto":123649842,"id":"hTnWpxgc","country":"US","country_name":"United States"}]},{"posts":[{"no":123647992,"now":"05\/01\/17(Mon)13:47:17","name":"jeb","sub":"Macron &amp; his people","com":"Scary or not?","filename":"moonsect","ext":".jpg","w":1024,"h":577,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":140,"tim":1493660837970,"time":1493660837,"md5":"NePVR9JhJMBzxZy\/AcpoPA==","fsize":83684,"resto":0,"id":"ZUBCmxr+","country":"FR","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"macron-his-people","country_name":"France","replies":3,"images":0},{"no":123650039,"now":"05\/01\/17(Mon)14:04:34","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123647992\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123647992<\/a><br>Give that man a pussy hat!","time":1493661874,"resto":123647992,"id":"onyFuwEV","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":123650163,"now":"05\/01\/17(Mon)14:05:40","name":"Anonymous","com":"<span class=\"quote\">&gt;all &quot;white&quot; frogs with problematic glasses<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;one Arab<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;one nig nog<\/span><br>Looks like the average French population to me.","time":1493661940,"resto":123647992,"id":"ET+w2o0c","country":"DE","country_name":"Germany"},{"no":123650261,"now":"05\/01\/17(Mon)14:06:40","name":"Anonymous","com":"All those misogynist pigs baka","time":1493662000,"resto":123647992,"id":"p9Ip6pfJ","country":"US","country_name":"United States"}]},{"posts":[{"no":123646313,"now":"05\/01\/17(Mon)13:33:07","name":"Anonymous","com":"Reminder that you are a cuck if your wife works anything other than teaching in primary school or as a gynaecologist (or some other &quot;feminine&quot; job).","filename":"we cuck do it","ext":".jpg","w":533,"h":749,"tn_w":177,"tn_h":250,"tim":1493659987911,"time":1493659987,"md5":"t4mUdTml0KJMKsxPCAhUVw==","fsize":101765,"resto":0,"id":"I1yJdV4D","country":"DZ","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"reminder-that-you-are-a-cuck-if-your-wife-works","country_name":"Algeria","replies":6,"images":0,"omitted_posts":1,"omitted_images":0},{"no":123647852,"now":"05\/01\/17(Mon)13:46:03","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123646824\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123646824<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;it&#039;s not quite possible to sustain a family unless I&#039;m a fucking CEO or something.<\/span><br>If by sustaining a family you mean having a swimming people and a big house, then yeah, totally.

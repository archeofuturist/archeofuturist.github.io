Some of it involving hate speech and other just non family friend content. Because of this it was widely reported that big advertisers were pulling out due to the current climate of that social justice movements for decades have been strengthening. While Google may be claiming that these problems are \u201cvery very very small\u201d and that the ad controversies will be rectified. They have slowly been rolling out changes, such as channels not being able to monetize unless they hit a certain threshold for views.<\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt; how Google is apparently handling it:<\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt; \u201cWe\u2019re also raising the bar for our ads policies to further safeguard our advertisers\u2019 brands.\u201d\u2026That statement followed a more direct plea to advertisers earlier this week in which Google promised it would be giving brands more direct control over and insight into where ads were placed on YouTube and Google-partnered third-party sites. The company also promised new tools like artificial intelligence-powered filtering that would detect offensive language and other contents within a video and flag it. Bloomberg reports that Google plans on implementing these new tools and changes as soon as this Sunday, according to an internal company memo.

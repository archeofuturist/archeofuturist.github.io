This was unbridled lust, a condom would be an insult to what both were about to experience. Lauren leaned her head back with her eyes close as T finally infiltrated her womanhood.

This paper theorizes that one future pedagogical priority of women\u2019s studies is to train students not only to master a body of knowledge but also to serve as symbolic \u201cviruses\u201d that infect, unsettle, and disrupt traditional and entrenched fields. In this essay, we first posit how the metaphor of the virus in part exemplifies an ideal feminist pedagogy, and we then investigate how both women\u2019s studies and the spread of actual viruses (e.g., Ebola, HIV) produce similar kinds of emotional responses in others.<\/span><br><br>link: http:\/\/hipatiapress.com\/hpjournals\/<wbr>index.php\/generos\/article\/viewFile\/<wbr>1983\/1624#page=78","filename":"how to read a book","ext":".jpg","w":200,"h":310,"tn_w":161,"tn_h":249,"tim":1490307523167,"time":1490307523,"md5":"SLhITUBgGLH\/A8II4FNSgw==","fsize":20155,"resto":0,"id":"BwT2ujbr","country":"CA","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"pol-learns-to-read-feminism-is-cancer-edition","country_name":"Canada","replies":3,"images":0},{"no":117993516,"now":"03\/23\/17(Thu)18:19:39","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p117993396\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;117993396<\/a><br>This is the last part of the abstract.<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;In doing so, we frame two new priorities for women\u2019s studies\u2014training male students as viruses and embracing \u201cnegative\u201d stereotypes of feminist professors\u2014as important future directions for the potentially liberatory aspects of the field.<\/span>","time":1490307579,"resto":117993396,"id":"BwT2ujbr","country":"CA","country_name":"Canada"},{"no":117993969,"now":"03\/23\/17(Thu)18:23:05","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p117993516\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;117993516<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;At the same time, women\u2019s studies offers\u2014by virtue of its interdisciplinary, critical, and \u201cinfectious\u201d structure\u2014cutting-edge perspectives and goals that differentiate itself from more traditional academic fields. Women\u2019s studies has wholly embraced both its humanism and its social science leanings; it occupies a place across fields, within fields, and has thoroughly (and somewhat chaotically) attached itself to numerous partnerships, cross-listings and interdisciplinary projects across the university (Romero, 2000). Women\u2019s studies programs traverse disciplinary boundaries and often exist permanently on the margins of academia (Hooks, 2000b), taking on topics as diverse as feminist science studies, critical intersectionality, embodiment, trans studies, and new materialisms. With its ever-changing names and alliances, women\u2019s studies has become even more difficult to locate and place within the corporatized university (Briggs, 2013), particularly as it prioritizes emotional course content, critical stances toward sexism, intense classroom dynamics, and the fusion between theory and practice (Fisher, 1987).<\/span><br><br>Some interesting elements: women&#039;s studies have &quot;attached&quot; (read: parasitized) different department and discipline.

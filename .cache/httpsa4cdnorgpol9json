That changed dramatically in theory as there seemingly were great advances in feminism. Feminism emerged in Paris as part of a broad demand for social and political reform. The women demanded equality to men and then moved on to a demand for the end of male domination.&quot;<br>&quot;When the Revolution started, some women struck forcefully, using the volatile political climate to assert their active natures. In the time of the Revolution, women could not be kept out of the political sphere&quot;<br>&quot;Most of these outwardly activist women were punished for their militancy. The kind of punishment received during the Revolution included public denouncement, arrest, execution, or exile. Th\u00e9roigne de M\u00e9ricourt was arrested, publicly flogged and then spent the rest of her life sentenced to an insane asylum. Pauline L\u00e9on and Claire Lacombe were arrested, later released, and continued to receive ridicule and abuse for their activism. Many of the women of the Revolution were even publicly executed for &quot;conspiring against the unity and the indivisibility of the Republic&quot;.[23]&quot;<br>You are just to weak to be able to use violence.

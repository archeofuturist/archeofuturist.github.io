Now, people who want to get that information will have to suck it up or spend their youth with crippling student debt. The perpetrators of this crime against public education? Stacy Nowak and Glenn Lockhart, who petitioned the National Association of the Deaf, which petitioned the Justice Department that these public, freely available educational videos were discriminatory against deaf people because they did not include subtitles. The Justice Department was forced to conclude that that was in fact the letter of the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA), and after that UC-Berkeley deleted the videos, taking a small step towards making it harder for self-studying and poor people to get access to educational materials.

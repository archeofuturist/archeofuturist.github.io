It completely destroyed any semblance of the notions of classical liberalism being applied to it&#039;s own populace in World War 2. Over a century of Fabian society marxist bullshit has warped our population into thinking that no matter what social problems are present in conemporary society, taxing the rich (and everyone else) will solve them. We drink water, we eat food and we think socialist. We have a political system that represents nobody and survives on pure tribalism. We have completely changed the nature of our capital city, because once the Labour party discovered that once working class oiks get a little cash together they tend to think more conservatively, so rather than adapt to this trend they thought it apt to import millions of foreigners so they would always have a large voting base (should&#039;ve imported a few million more given their current predicament). We are America&#039;s lapdog and our quaint, yet glorious culture is becoming more base and vulgar as a result of it. We shot ourselves in the foot when the church endorsed the actions fo the government (wholesale slaughter of young men) in World War 1, rather than being above the temporary whims of nation and government.<br><br>We also have regulations that seem hellbent on destroying small business, I mean if your local Paki shopkeeper decides to show you his fine selection of tobaccos so you can make your choice, that business can then be fined to the tune of \u00a310,000. We have a bullshit education system, which gives you no knwoledge of the classics (because oiks can&#039;t afford it, and even if they could what would they do with that knowledge except subvert our Marxist ideals)and history is taught with massive 500 year gaps. This means what our youth get isn&#039;t a richer understanding of the world, but instead a few trendy job skills like programming which will be outdated by the time they enter the workforce.","time":1493437833,"resto":123282811,"id":"aAxLPXpl","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":123293038,"now":"04\/29\/17(Sat)00:03:56","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123291752\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123291752<\/a><br><br>We also have a paedophile occupational government, which nobody seems to care about.

Not only that, we have to pay a fucking tribute to this immoral organisation under the threat of a fine for not choosing not to enjoy their homosexual\/socialist\/racemixing propaganda.<br><br> We have a healthcare system which has a complete stranglehold on the nation, is always short of funding, and will never address it&#039;s true funding problem (like Africans and Pakis coming over solely to get treatment on the NHS). Our governments, whether they be Labour or Tory want to browbeat us with this funding crisis so they can tax whatever the fuck they like (the next labour government will give us fat, sugar and alcohol taxes). Real wages haven&#039;t risen at all since 2008. Most of our towns look like the one in Eraserhead. Our police has surrendered all of it&#039;s power to the courts, so you have completely unsafe streets to walk down, but that&#039;s okay, I&#039;m sure longer punitive sentences within our already packed prisons will show the criminals a thing or two (when they aren&#039;t fucked on spice or converting to Islam).

These interactions are guided by societal &#039;rule&#039; or norms of behavior. These norms can change over time based on internal or external sources. But are reinforced to stay as is by the concept of tradition. Tradition while there is an emotional component to it, is essentially based on the principle of, &quot;If it ain&#039;t broke don&#039;t fix it.&quot; <br><br>Different cultures have different norms of behavior. Those with the most advantageous norms had the most stable and prosperous societies. Those with middling societal norms didn&#039;t do as well, and those with awful norms died out. Eventually the norms which were the most successful displaced with even middling norms. The highly successful norms of societies are nuclear family, rule of law, private property, justice system to prevent murder, usurpation and other crime.<br><br>Because these norms became so pervasive through the iterative process of societal growth, they became associated with &#039;traditional&#039; values. Traditional values are traditional because they work. They allowed generation after generation of those societies to flourish, prosper, and most importantly produce another generation that would do the same.","filename":"two genders","ext":".jpg","w":480,"h":360,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":93,"tim":1493435250636,"time":1493435250,"md5":"UX8uh1R8L0Asa2Fb+DL+fw==","fsize":24367,"resto":123285574,"id":"tnTx0aBC","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":123290624,"now":"04\/28\/17(Fri)23:38:22","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123286110\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123286110<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Gay sex<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Pedophilia <\/span><br>ok","time":1493437102,"resto":123285574,"id":"e3jYnX9w","country":"CA","country_name":"Canada"},{"no":123292257,"now":"04\/28\/17(Fri)23:55:31","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123290624\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123290624<\/a><br>or you know, a philosophically sound basis for why an objective morality can exist.

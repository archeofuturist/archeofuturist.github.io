He completed the high school curriculum in Texas by age 15, and was working on a Masters at Duke at age 20, when I met him. He only supported homeschooling for children under the circumsance that the parents have an excellent general education. Sadly, unless you&#039;re extremely well educated in a myriad of subjects (such as a physician or a lawyer might be) you&#039;re probably better of deferring some of the responsibility of educating your child to teachers. If you have the means to do it, put your kids into a private school and provide them with supplentary education at home.","time":1492704694,"resto":122006870,"id":"iwGzJ5nK","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":122009224,"now":"04\/20\/17(Thu)12:12:21","name":"Crownon","com":"<a href=\"#p122006870\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122006870<\/a><br>it&#039;s god awful but it&#039;s better than public school.","time":1492704741,"resto":122006870,"id":"BZA3Rc\/z","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":122009311,"now":"04\/20\/17(Thu)12:13:08","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122008833\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122008833<\/a><br>OH MY QUAD-DUBS.","time":1492704788,"resto":122006870,"id":"iwGzJ5nK","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":122009326,"now":"04\/20\/17(Thu)12:13:17","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122006870\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122006870<\/a><br>Homeschool is infinitely better than public school, no matter how bad the parents are.

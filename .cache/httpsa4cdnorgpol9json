Fatties are literally forced starved in pre-bootcamp.<br><br>- DO NOT MIX CURRENT PROFESSIONAL BRANCHES WITH DRAFTEEFAGS!!! Drafted snowflakes get safe logistical\/admin\/civil affairs jobs with even no weapons training. De-cucked and woke draftees can have more of a defensive role and in turn receive training that will check elite power down the line.

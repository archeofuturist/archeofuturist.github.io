Recently there has been a large influx of people from the south side of Chicago who have brought there problems with them. This quiet town is now filled with violence; random people are being shot, people&#039;s houses are being robbed, I can&#039;t let my children wander a block away. What do I do? These niggers destroy everything, just the other day my wife went shopping and was followed by two black men who cornered her in the parking lot and took her purse.

The elites are pretty fucking good at pushing for *just* enough bullshit that it never seems to push anybody over the edge. It&#039;s slow and gradual to the point where nobody will ever bother doing anything to stop it. I feel like with Hillary, we would have just experienced the same, slow, gradual decline that we&#039;ve experienced for the past several decades, and nobody would have done anything about it. <br><br>Furthermore, a defeat for Trump would have been a crushing blow to the entirety of the right-wing (from generic conservatives to many far-right individuals) that threw their weight behind him. He, in essence, had to win, for better or for worse. So many people were interested in right-wing politics for the first time because of Trump, and had he lost, we probably would have seen a lot of people drop out of politics as we did when Bernie lost and his supporters just said &quot;fuck it&quot;. Right wing ideas would be so incredibly shamed and browbeaten (that&#039;s not to say that they aren&#039;t now, but people don&#039;t give a fuck because we won), that I feel like the surge of right wing sentiment we see these days would have been stopped dead.<br><br>And I mean, with regards to what we&#039;re seeing now, the right-wing has become the new counter culture. Whether they&#039;re being genuine or they&#039;re being edgy, far-right ideas are a part of this counter-culture, and therefore, are beginning to enter the public consciousness. Over time, the people that ironically say &quot;Hitler did nothing wrong!&quot; are unironically saying it. Watching the left double down on their disgusting trash and get violent about it (i.e. antifa) is redpilling a ton of people, and the overuse of the words &quot;nazi&quot;, &quot;racist&quot;, etc., are making people more comfortable with identifying as those labels.","time":1493265010,"resto":122986489,"id":"+pQBfBeQ","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":122991647,"now":"04\/26\/17(Wed)23:58:53","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122986489\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122986489<\/a><br>You did not have time to let another leftist increase your numbers.

The as-yet-unnamed carrier still requires much more additional work before it joins PLAN&#039;s fleet. But the ship&#039;s construction began less than five years ago (in November of 2012), and it only moved into full dry-dock construction in 2015. And China appears poised to churn out additional new aircraft carriers even faster based upon the experience acquired in this first homegrown carrier project.<br><br>Adding a second aircraft carrier will dramatically increase China&#039;s ability to project power in the Western Pacific. There are limits to the reach of the Liaoning and its new sister ship, however. Both are conventional steam-powered ships rather than nuclear-powered. The new carrier has a displacement of 50,000 metric tons (slightly larger than the Liaoning), which is half the size of the Ford. But while the Liaoning has been outfitted as a training ship, Zhu pointed out in March, the new carrier will be China&#039;s first real combat carrier. And as China military strategist PLA Major General Peng Guangqian explained, while China&#039;s new carrier is not on par with US aircraft carriers, the difference is partially &quot;because US Navy doctrine requires unchallenged global dominance, while Chinese carriers are mainly used for self-defense.&quot;<br><br>That &quot;self-defense&quot; is likely to be focused on &quot;sea denial&quot; operations, particularly in the disputed waters of the South China Sea and Yellow Sea. But the new combat carrier could also allow China to conduct operations much further afield.","filename":"ChineseCraftmanship","ext":".jpg","w":1024,"h":641,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":156,"tim":1493528450126,"time":1493528450,"md5":"qjb\/mkk\/RTkFg7HHOLVnow==","fsize":129394,"resto":0,"id":"LBGG0qmv","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"china-launches-domestically-produced-aircraft","country_name":"United States","replies":7,"images":3,"omitted_posts":2,"omitted_images":1},{"no":123440716,"now":"04\/30\/17(Sun)01:19:57","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123438839\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123438839<\/a><br>bump","filename":"JOE BIDEN PEDO","ext":".jpg","w":1020,"h":720,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":88,"tim":1493529597881,"time":1493529597,"md5":"K8r4gWI9wF6j8kad\/l72NA==","fsize":290012,"resto":123438839,"id":"6x6Y+etQ","country":"RS","country_name":"Serbia"},{"no":123440938,"now":"04\/30\/17(Sun)01:22:32","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123438839\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123438839<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;oh look a fucking ramp<\/span><br>says the increasingly nervous americans for the 100th time this week","filename":"1493487260419","ext":".jpg","w":250,"h":241,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":120,"tim":1493529752695,"time":1493529752,"md5":"Gp9Mj0h8tdqfx3XA1TygRg==","fsize":6841,"resto":123438839,"id":"qWcaI9b5","country":"CN","country_name":"China"},{"no":123441138,"now":"04\/30\/17(Sun)01:24:20","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123440938\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123440938<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Ching chong ling long<\/span><br>Says a chink for the 100th time this week","time":1493529860,"resto":123438839,"id":"UjzOu3ZS","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":123442687,"now":"04\/30\/17(Sun)01:42:03","name":"Anonymous","com":"<span class=\"quote\">&gt;It has a ramp<\/span>","filename":"chinese_kek_","ext":".jpg","w":1600,"h":1150,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":89,"tim":1493530923971,"time":1493530923,"md5":"LgqTj9XfSzR5xE7TGtp5wg==","fsize":202441,"resto":123438839,"id":"Q72teYTE","country":"US","m_img":1,"country_name":"United States"},{"no":123442999,"now":"04\/30\/17(Sun)01:45:30","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123438839\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123438839<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;literally just bought a Russian ship with no electronics and copied it<\/span><br><br>https:\/\/rusreality.com\/2017\/04\/26\/t<wbr>he-new-chinese-aircraft-carrier-was<wbr>-an-old-soviet\/<br><br>Jesus christ can a chinese man invent anything on their own?","time":1493531130,"resto":123438839,"id":"9b4imIZy","country":"US","country_name":"United States"}]},{"posts":[{"no":123441306,"now":"04\/30\/17(Sun)01:26:00","name":"Anonymous","sub":"Operation Caesar","com":"If you really want to test our power, why not see if we can make the Roman salute unrelated to white supremacy?","filename":"Adolf Hitler Walking Through a Crowd Saluting","ext":".jpg","w":2814,"h":2135,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":189,"tim":1493529960032,"time":1493529960,"md5":"V7a5VjRg7F3CP51kZaznFw==","fsize":612546,"resto":0,"id":"fKEkJHGx","country":"US","m_img":1,"bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"operation-caesar","country_name":"United States","replies":6,"images":0,"omitted_posts":1,"omitted_images":0},{"no":123441575,"now":"04\/30\/17(Sun)01:28:58","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123441394\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123441394<\/a><br>To see if we can make more people do the salute","time":1493530138,"resto":123441306,"id":"fKEkJHGx","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":123442281,"now":"04\/30\/17(Sun)01:37:01","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123441306\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123441306<\/a><br>Go on.","time":1493530621,"resto":123441306,"id":"LyeOKKt0","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":123442327,"now":"04\/30\/17(Sun)01:37:34","name":"Anonymous","com":"The Roman salute will always be linked to white supremacy.

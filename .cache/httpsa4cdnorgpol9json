I&#039;m very disillusioned at the moment. For all that right-wingers kick up a fuss about leftist bullshit, there&#039;s no actual way to stop their values from sinking in. The female vote was once an outrageous concept, and conservatives 100+ years ago resisted and complained about it. In spite of this, it is considered as normal now as a man&#039;s right to vote was in the early 1900s. The same thing is happening again with the acceptance of transfags. People aren&#039;t fully convinced yet, but the idea that gender can be decided by the individual will be as normal in the year 2120 as our conception of biologically determined gender is now. The point I&#039;m trying to make isn&#039;t about transgenderism in particular, though. I&#039;m just using it as an example to illustrate the inevitability of left-wing ideas rooting themselves into society.<br><br>The conservative mindset operates under the false assumption that the two sides have an equal chance of winning \u2013 that, by resisting lefty bollocks, you can keep tradition intact. But, in reality, it amounts to nothing more than a delaying tactic. Once a libshit idea enters mainstream consciousness, the battle is already lost. The best conservatives can do is slow down the rate at which it is accepted by the populace, but its eventual acceptance is inevitable at that point.<br><br>If you look back on history, our overall movement has been towards the left rather than the right.","filename":"8fjd52bf","ext":".jpg","w":745,"h":1119,"tn_w":166,"tn_h":250,"tim":1490185111120,"time":1490185111,"md5":"XgroyT4VetXH9kz8t1hwOw==","fsize":117914,"resto":0,"id":"A6ARSFPJ","country":"GB","m_img":1,"bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"how-do-you-deal-with-the-fact-that-youre","country_name":"United Kingdom","replies":41,"images":12,"omitted_posts":36,"omitted_images":10},{"no":117758618,"now":"03\/22\/17(Wed)09:37:15","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p117752508\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;117752508<\/a><br>You start speaking the truth, anon.

As soon as America losses petrol dollar, every signle westerm country (up until 2001, this did not include Switzerland) will have an economic collapse that you can&#039;t properly imagine. The American dollar is backed by nothing but oil and is already hyperinflated (that is why we keep fighting in the middle east). Your euro is backed by our dollar and the swiss franc gave up the gold standard.<br><br> But there&#039;s a silver lining. During The Collapse we will have the chance to create great nations again. But we have to remember how we got here and how to stop it. Women must NEVER be allowed to vote, it has to be in some way an irrefutable part of the country&#039;s laws. The welfare state can only exist for the people of your country if it is truly inseparable from prosperity. We can&#039;t have uncontrolled immigration of inferior people.

However as I dig and dig, i&#039;m finding overlooked and missed history. Nazi Germany did have non-whites in their military contrary to popular beliefs. However, i&#039;m still reading about how it was like growing up under Nazi occupation.<br>Yes, the Jews were still being persecuted and sent to the camps. But reading on history, Hitler and the party didn&#039;t have any real rules in set for visible minorities such as arabs, blacks, etc due to the population being relatively small. Apparently the Nazis had a Arab foreign legion during the North African campaign that actively tried to recruit the natives. India was fighting against British rule from what I heard so allying with the Axis was rather easy. Then of course the Asian population in the German ranks as well.<br>This is from reading the internet last night.

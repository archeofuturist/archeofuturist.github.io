Not a written language, weaved cloth, a calendar, a plow, a road, a bridge, a railway, a ship, a system of measurement, or even the wheel. (Note: This is in reference to the pure-blooded Negro.) He is not known to have ever cultivated a single crop or domesticated a single animal for his own use (although many powerful and docile beasts abounded around him.) His only known means of transporting goods was on the top of his hard burry head. for shelter he never progressed beyond the common mud hut, the construction of which a beaver or muskrat is capable.<br><br>The White race has crossed seas, harnessed rivers, carved mountains, tamed deserts, and colonized the most barren icefields. It has been responsible for the invention of the printing press, cement, the harnessing of electricity, flight, rocketry, astronomy, the telescope, space travel, firearms, the transistor, radio, television, the telephone, the lightbulb, photography, motion pictures, the phonograph, the electric battery, the automobile, the steam engine, railroad transportation, the microscope, computers, and millions of other technological miracles. It has discovered countless medical advances, incredible applications, scientific progress, etc. Its members have included such greats as Socrates, Aristotle, Plato, Homer, Tacitus, Julius Ceaser, Napoleon, William the Conqueror, Marco Polo, Washington, Jefferson, Hitler, Bach, Beethoven, Mozart, Magellan, Columbus, Cabot, Edison, GrahamBell, Pasteur, Leeuwenhoek, Mendel, Darwin, Newton, Galileo, Watt, Ford, Luther, Devinci, Poe, Tennyson, and thousands upon thousands of other notable achievers.","filename":"napoleon-1er","ext":".jpg","w":625,"h":952,"tn_w":164,"tn_h":250,"tim":1491435440237,"time":1491435440,"md5":"8bj17R6TmYg2KPbgK2Rg1Q==","fsize":164080,"resto":0,"id":"L6nJdxyH","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"throughout-6000-years-of-recorded-history-the","country_name":"United States","replies":2,"images":1},{"no":119674398,"now":"04\/05\/17(Wed)19:41:37","name":"Anonymous","com":"<span class=\"quote\">&gt;tfw english<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;tfw english people as an ethnic group have contributed more to the world than anyone else<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;tfw all i do is sit around shitposting on an anime imageboard<\/span>","filename":"1479504175017","ext":".png","w":738,"h":845,"tn_w":109,"tn_h":125,"tim":1491435697002,"time":1491435697,"md5":"icHUnJ32mAbdgudEPfSi3g==","fsize":632601,"resto":119673974,"id":"yXrOXoOb","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":119674762,"now":"04\/05\/17(Wed)19:44:48","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119673974\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119673974<\/a><br>and what the fuck are you doing faggot? <br><br>you don&#039;t get to claim this bullshit glory if you&#039;re just some fat weeabo","time":1491435888,"resto":119673974,"id":"eVhXjiMT","country":"US","country_name":"United States"}]},{"posts":[{"no":119674129,"now":"04\/05\/17(Wed)19:39:02","name":"Anonymous","com":"are you retarded?","filename":"1489569207252","ext":".jpg","w":487,"h":457,"tn_w":249,"tn_h":234,"tim":1491435542545,"time":1491435542,"md5":"IGSFSrtvNTk+5SgrEfCz+w==","fsize":36027,"resto":0,"id":"igSsr5vt","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"are-you-retarded","country_name":"United States","replies":3,"images":0},{"no":119674347,"now":"04\/05\/17(Wed)19:41:07","name":"Anonymous","com":"fbpb","time":1491435667,"resto":119674129,"id":"gozJCUBl","country":"RS","country_name":"Serbia"},{"no":119674443,"now":"04\/05\/17(Wed)19:42:00","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119674347\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119674347<\/a><br>I agree with this Croatian poster.","time":1491435720,"resto":119674129,"id":"W+XjVpCr","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":119674759,"now":"04\/05\/17(Wed)19:44:47","name":"Anonymous","com":"I once ate 17 hits of acid","time":1491435887,"resto":119674129,"id":"w4OwpFbF","country":"US","country_name":"United States"}]},{"posts":[{"no":119674751,"now":"04\/05\/17(Wed)19:44:45","name":"Anonymous","com":"Destroy Communism, destroy North Korean concentration camps, destroy ISIS, Vote Le Pen, Build the wall, Support Trump, Kek, Arrest the leaders and disband BLM and Antifa, Socially outcast Feminism, End SJW thought policing, Destroy SJWs control over our advertisers and journalists, Restore monetisation for YouTube, Kick out Marxist professors from our universities, Uphold free speech, Vet refugees, Reduce all immigration to an assimilatable level, Encourage condemnation of barbaric Muslim teachings, make Hollywood non partisan, Support Fracking and remove money from going to barbaric middle eastern shit hole despots.

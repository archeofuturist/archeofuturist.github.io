Pretty good analysis overall I think, basicaly the teachers are recruiting their students<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;So the Visibility section of the pamphlet makes one thing very clear: all recruiting is done person to person \u2014 there are no mass, public signups. That would create the risk of infiltration. This lends a bit of credence to my professor\/student theory. The sheer numbers these antifa groups are enlisting makes me very skeptical that they\u2019re recruiting only from social circles. These groups are showing up 100s of members deep at events. Is it likely that someone who isn\u2019t in an influential position like a professor would have access to the number of people necessary to filter out the right people to recruit? Say 1 out of every 10 leftist students would actually join an antifa group and 5 out of every 10 college students are politically-active leftists (these are completely hypothetical numbers). Whom other than a professor has access to enough students to recruit 1 out of every 30? Once again, these are totally hypothetical numbers, but the point stands: the pamphlet strongly suggests that the founders are also the recruiters, so they must have access to a large pool of potentially violent leftists.

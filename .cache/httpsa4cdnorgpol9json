The first elected governor of Arab descent in the United States,[1][2] Atiyeh was elected in 1978, defeating incumbent Democratic Governor Robert W. Straub. He was re-elected against future Governor Ted Kulongoski with 61.6% of the vote in 1982, the largest margin in 32 years.[1] Prior to being elected Governor, Atiyeh had served continuously in the Oregon Legislature since 1959, initially in the House and later in the Senate. To date, Atiyeh is the last Republican to have served as the governor of Oregon.[3]<br><br>The son of Syrian immigrants, Atiyeh grew up in Portland, attending Holladay Grade School and Washington High School.[4] He spent two years at the University of Oregon in Eugene, where he played guard for the Oregon Ducks football program and became a regional leader in the Boy Scouts of America.[5] When his father died Atiyeh dropped out of college and took over his family&#039;s rug and carpet business, Atiyeh Brothers.[5][6]","filename":"victor-g-vic-atiyeh","ext":".jpg","w":665,"h":1000,"tn_w":83,"tn_h":125,"tim":1491585057391,"time":1491585057,"md5":"fIonZ04g1IcC3cNFAKbAYQ==","fsize":86325,"resto":119978316,"id":"KYoXBv8V","country":"US","country_name":"United States"}]},{"posts":[{"no":119978373,"now":"04\/07\/17(Fri)12:39:23","name":"Anonymous","com":"Should news sites that don&#039;t have comments section be trusted?","filename":"1489905473841","ext":".jpg","w":1357,"h":2048,"tn_w":165,"tn_h":250,"tim":1491583163735,"time":1491583163,"md5":"EDVk7Uz10sU4mZXNQYSy0Q==","fsize":233715,"resto":0,"id":"CVR0n96v","country":"US","m_img":1,"bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"should-news-sites-that-dont-have-comments-section","country_name":"United States","replies":11,"images":0,"omitted_posts":6,"omitted_images":0},{"no":119979174,"now":"04\/07\/17(Fri)12:44:09","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119978373\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119978373<\/a><br>Nope, the ones with them shouldn&#039;t be either.<br>It isn&#039;t the source, its the content.","time":1491583449,"resto":119978373,"id":"lk4H6bMX","country":"CA","country_name":"Canada"},{"no":119979587,"now":"04\/07\/17(Fri)12:46:43","name":"Anonymous","com":"its completely obvious that any news site that shuts down its comment section should not be trusted, it is worse when sites shadowban commenters and cultivate a garden of non-dissenting voices. huffington post is a main one","time":1491583603,"resto":119978373,"id":"JHVjaoi0","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":119980989,"now":"04\/07\/17(Fri)12:54:38","name":"Anonymous","com":"hnggg those tights and feet","time":1491584078,"resto":119978373,"id":"7fPPI77A","country":"ES","country_name":"Spain"},{"no":119982745,"now":"04\/07\/17(Fri)13:04:43","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119979106\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119979106<\/a><br>right, she&#039;s 4\/10th of a typical merifat landwhale.","time":1491584683,"resto":119978373,"id":"ZhHUSWOz","country":"AT","country_name":"Austria"},{"no":119983067,"now":"04\/07\/17(Fri)13:06:57","name":"Anonymous","com":"<span class=\"quote\">&gt;thinking there&#039;s actual value in online newspaper comment sections<\/span><br>it&#039;s one step above youtube comments.

And yes, I am aware of the shilling, and concern trolling, and World War 3 terrified posters turning their autism against trump. And I am also aware of the very possible upsides to this attack that he could have meant for. All things considered, especially that his whole &quot;support for israel and jewish daughter&quot; thing is starting to take shape in his decisions with this attack, can we TRULY support him or fully denounce him? I mean, just look at pic related. I think this is incredible. I don&#039;t honestly know how I feel at the moment and it sucks. On one hand, what he did was scummy and looked like he bowed down to the deep state with no upsides. On the otherhand, if the autism of &quot;4028 DIMENSIONAL BASKETWEAVING&quot; actually ends up being true, then it will have been a good decision. (I am aware of this being very unlikely.)

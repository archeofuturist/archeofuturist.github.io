I dated her when I was a teenager so I spent a considerable amount of time with her family. <br><br>Even when I dated her when bluepilled I said that &quot;jewish memes are set up so to make a successful diaspora population, such as extreme in group preference and the limiting of interethnic marriage ensured that the jews would not just get absorbed by the host culture.&quot; At the time I didn&#039;t think this was a bad thing because I had not yet put the pieces together. <br><br>Her dad seemed very redpilled in a way and he said things like &quot;jews should not run countries&quot; which I assumed meant he disagreed with the policies of israel but looking back might have been something more because he also said that situations like nazi germany only ever happened when jews begun to leave their tight communities and become part of the wider culture and politics. Me being naive assumed that this meant they were giving up the extreme ethnocentrism but they actually don&#039;t give up the ethnocentrism. They are contributing to the wider culture and politics without actually being a part of the wider culture so they have zero incentive to preserve it, and in some cases might actually work against it for the good of the jewish community. One of these ways is rejecting nationalism because when you engage in ethno-nationalism the natural question arises &quot;what do you do about the jews?&quot;. the origin of the Jewish Question predated hitler and the nazis and is just a natural thing that arises from nationalism. <br><br>It was naive to assume the jews were not ethnocentrist because her parents clearly were because her mom complain that a jewish piano guy would not help her son do some piano stuff. she thought he would help her son because they were both jewish.

The jews convinced the UK to support the creation of israel. <br><br>The thing is that zionism did not die when israel was created, its still going on now. ZIonist billionaires are working for the interests of israel. <br><br>The conspiracy component is that over time the zionists have gained more and more control over western media and government to the point that they can get america to have a pro-zionism foreign policy.<br><br>Why I think my interpretation is enlightened is that it does not require a bunch of jews to be sitting around a table controlling things, its just that most jews are pro-zionist and are in positions of power so they just all sort of know what they need to do without being directed. Their are some zionist billionaires who are funding other things as well.","time":1493953146,"resto":124147921,"id":"I7CnR7EM","country":"CA","country_name":"Canada"},{"no":124155121,"now":"05\/04\/17(Thu)23:03:32","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p124153230\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;124153230<\/a><br>You pretty well got btfod by this unusually based leaf.<br><a href=\"#p124154650\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;124154650<\/a>","time":1493953412,"resto":124147921,"id":"luU4a9Dc","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":124155229,"now":"05\/04\/17(Thu)23:04:29","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p124153230\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;124153230<\/a><br>read the culture of critique. jews work to increase the power of other jews as a part of their culture because it was necessary to survive as a diaspora. the thing is that this just never ends, they constantly try to get more power, because that is what their culture tells them to do.

The &#039;myth of the metals&#039; which is required in order to create a society that functions on the basis where everyone believes they are doing the best good possible for their community is actually built into jewish critique. <br><br>EVERY SINGLE JEWISH RITE OF PASSAGE is attended by rabbis, and most require extensive study of repetition, critical thinking, and a very important intellectual &#039;trial by fire&#039; attended by top rabbis in the community. The vast majority never make it past a certain point, and thus are not told the economic secrets necessary to exert a great amount of control over society. However, with each rite of passage, the more gifted are given increasingly more influential positions in society and form connections with those who hold key power in jewish society. <br><br>They never make jewish kids feel like they&#039;ve done a &#039;bad&#039; job, but the ones that are exceptionally brilliant receive substantially more aid and influence from the greater jewish religious and financial community. <br><br>They use this so that their familial ties are stronger than any society ever seen throughout all history. It&#039;s simple enough for them to accomplish once the system is in place, and the critical nature of it weeds out the best and brightest (possibly the least moral in the upper echelons).<br><br>Tl;dr: jews have more control over society because their ethnicity functions as a state, Zionism is just a reflection of this in policy making.","time":1493954507,"resto":124147921,"id":"RI2H0hD\/","country":"CA","country_name":"Canada"}]},{"posts":[{"no":124150365,"now":"05\/04\/17(Thu)22:19:33","name":"Anonymous","com":"Why do late night comedians like ripping into Trump?","filename":"IMG_20170504_221820","ext":".jpg","w":1247,"h":713,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":142,"tim":1493950773726,"time":1493950773,"md5":"ZpMoxoW4okayK2sBagVPyw==","fsize":128743,"resto":0,"id":"KKDc0Nqo","country":"US","m_img":1,"bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"why-do-late-night-comedians-like-ripping-into","country_name":"United States","replies":43,"images":4,"omitted_posts":38,"omitted_images":4},{"no":124154876,"now":"05\/04\/17(Thu)23:01:21","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p124154539\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;124154539<\/a><br>Yeah, they could have made her into a psychotic Basic Instinct\/Fatal Attraction type of character.

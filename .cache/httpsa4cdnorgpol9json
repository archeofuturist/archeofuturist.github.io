Their books of Morals chiefly consisted in a minute enumeration of duties. From the law of Moses were deduced 613. precepts, which were divided into two classes, affirmative and negative, 248 in the former, and 365 in the latter. It may serve to give the reader some idea of the low state of moral philosophy among the Jews in the Middle age, to add, that of the 248. affirmative precepts, only 3. were considered as obligatory upon women; and that, in order to obtain salvation, it was judged sufficient to fulfill any one single law in the hour of death; the observance of the rest being deemed necessary, only to increase the felicity of the future life. What a wretched depravity of sentiment and manners must have prevailed before such corrupt maxims could have obtained credit! It is impossible to collect from these writings a consistent series of moral Doctrine.&#039; Enfield, B. 4. chap. 3.

I wanted to take a second and make a thread thanking you various anons. Over the past few years (found 4chan in 2007 from green text stories), I&#039;ve come here daily for the laughs, the heart ache, and the pranks. <br><br>When I found \/pol\/ in 2009, then \/new\/ I began to see the transformation first hand. It was a glorious thing to see. But at the same time, I knew it would be bitter sweet. You see, \/pol\/ is the not only the last place on the surface web which promotes free speech, it promotes free thinking. It begs you to ask the questions of &quot;How come? Why not? What if? or Then what?&quot; These questions have been lost in daily society but live and breath here as the lifeline and pulse of \/pol\/. You guys helped me understand that without continuous questioning the truth would forever remain hidden and with it, hope. <br><br>That&#039;s what \/pol\/ is to me. In some ways you could call me a masochist for thinking this was. Taking the red pill, going down the rabbit hole and coming out the other end wishing I was dead and never saw or read what I had. But in the end, it was well worth it. So in conclusion the most truthful statement I have read on \/pol\/ came from a thread not more than 30 mins ago and it summarized \/pol\/ so well I had to share it. <br><br>&quot;The upside is a community of like minded individuals all plagued by the same bitterness.&quot; <br><br>Remember who we are \/pol\/, we are that voice in the wilderness crying out to people to repent of their ways and see the truth.

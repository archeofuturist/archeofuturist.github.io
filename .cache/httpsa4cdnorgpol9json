You are in no way a warrior and there is no such thing as social justice. You are so indoctrinatied that you will never see how small minded you all are. You will never think for yourselves. But it&#039;s ok to call us conservicucks (how original), racists, homophobes, and whatever phobes or ists you can think of because we have a dissenting opinion.

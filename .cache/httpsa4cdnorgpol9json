The experiment confirmed Alexander Oparin&#039;s and J. B. S. Haldane&#039;s hypothesis that putative conditions on the primitive Earth favoured chemical reactions that synthesized more complex organic compounds from simpler inorganic precursors. Considered to be the classic experiment investigating abiogenesis<br><br>The experiment used water (H2O), methane (CH4), ammonia (NH3), and hydrogen (H2). The chemicals were all sealed inside a sterile 5-liter glass flask connected to a 500 ml flask half-full of liquid water. The liquid water in the smaller flask was heated to induce evaporation, and the water vapour was allowed to enter the larger flask. Continuous electrical sparks were fired between the electrodes to simulate lightning in the water vapour and gaseous mixture, and then the simulated atmosphere was cooled again so that the water condensed and trickled into a U-shaped trap at the bottom of the apparatus.<br>After a day, the solution collected at the trap had turned pink in colour....Miller identified five amino acids present in the solution: glycine, \u03b1-alanine and \u03b2-alanine were positively identified, while aspartic acid and \u03b1-aminobutyric acid (AABA) were less certain, due to the spots being faint.[4]<br>In a 1996 interview, Stanley Miller recollected his lifelong experiments following his original work and stated: &quot;Just turning on the spark in a basic pre-biotic experiment will yield 11 out of 20 amino acids.&quot;[10]","filename":"1461092692550","ext":".jpg","w":2048,"h":1358,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":82,"tim":1491457227201,"time":1491457227,"md5":"Ti0j2VX4elwmp9R4H7rKbA==","fsize":857812,"resto":119681313,"id":"\/qbjB99Y","country":"US","m_img":1,"country_name":"United States"},{"no":119711111,"now":"04\/06\/17(Thu)01:40:47","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119710996\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119710996<\/a><br>Fuck, meant to quote <br><a href=\"#p119710738\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119710738<\/a><br><br>I&#039;m not used to post on my phone","time":1491457247,"resto":119681313,"id":"l\/CWDGsg","country":"BR","country_name":"Brazil"},{"no":119711320,"now":"04\/06\/17(Thu)01:43:11","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119682374\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119682374<\/a><br><a href=\"#p119682374\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119682374<\/a><br><a href=\"#p119682374\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119682374<\/a><br>and here we go","time":1491457391,"resto":119681313,"id":"I37hmyuM","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":119711388,"now":"04\/06\/17(Thu)01:44:02","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119710495\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119710495<\/a><br>a formless void of nothing where nothing ever existed and nobody missed it?","time":1491457442,"resto":119681313,"id":"5Yc3JSQs","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":119711438,"now":"04\/06\/17(Thu)01:44:36","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119709242\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119709242<\/a><br><br>How do I kill my ego?","time":1491457476,"resto":119681313,"id":"JmZBoOo2","country":"US","country_name":"United States"}]},{"posts":[{"no":119707506,"now":"04\/06\/17(Thu)00:59:45","name":"Anonymous","com":"MUH SANCTUARY CITY","filename":"You have to go back","ext":".png","w":1258,"h":1140,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":226,"tim":1491454785012,"time":1491454785,"md5":"Z4tRp8GbJIYBkXnbgpMYdg==","fsize":1057107,"resto":0,"id":"MGwXSCCk","country":"CA","m_img":1,"bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"muh-sanctuary-city","country_name":"Canada","replies":1,"images":0},{"no":119709521,"now":"04\/06\/17(Thu)01:22:10","name":"Anonymous","com":"stupid spics","time":1491456130,"resto":119707506,"id":"MGwXSCCk","country":"CA","country_name":"Canada"}]},{"posts":[{"no":119709115,"now":"04\/06\/17(Thu)01:17:51","name":"Anonymous","com":"Did Trump finally get stumped?","filename":"IMG_3264","ext":".png","w":650,"h":388,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":149,"tim":1491455871437,"time":1491455871,"md5":"lCwlO7Uz\/mliXXMnS7LiJQ==","fsize":337548,"resto":0,"id":"t0MW2aaU","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"did-trump-finally-get-stumped","country_name":"United States","replies":5,"images":1},{"no":119709199,"now":"04\/06\/17(Thu)01:18:46","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119709115\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119709115<\/a><br>this question is for your master.","filename":"OnePercent","ext":".jpg","w":989,"h":1280,"tn_w":96,"tn_h":125,"tim":1491455926765,"time":1491455926,"md5":"pjoGik0hat0p2vUXnnIS\/Q==","fsize":264761,"resto":119709115,"id":"sqG6VFiQ","country":"US","m_img":1,"country_name":"United States"},{"no":119709201,"now":"04\/06\/17(Thu)01:18:48","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119709115\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119709115<\/a><br>What happened?

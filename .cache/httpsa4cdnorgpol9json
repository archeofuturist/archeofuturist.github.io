In a speech at the ceremony, Mercer, who grew up in New Mexico, said that he had a \u201cjaundiced view\u201d of government. While in college, he had worked on a military base in Albuquerque, and he had showed his superiors how to run certain computer programs a hundred times faster; instead of saving time and money, the bureaucrats ran a hundred times more equations. He concluded that the goal of government officials was \u201cnot so much to get answers as to consume the computer budget.\u201d Mercer\u2019s colleagues say that he views the government as arrogant and inefficient, and believes that individuals need to be self-sufficient, and should not receive aid from the state. Yet, when I.B.M. failed to offer adequate support for Mercer and Brown\u2019s translation project, they secured additional funding from darpa, the secretive Pentagon program. Despite Mercer\u2019s disdain for \u201cbig government,\u201d this funding was essential to his early success.","time":1490567561,"resto":118407722,"id":"0JGDaBIY","country":"DE","country_name":"Germany"},{"no":118428243,"now":"03\/26\/17(Sun)18:34:01","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118407722\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118407722<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;almost a disaster<\/span><br>did we watch the same convention?

Accordingly, postmodern thought is broadly characterized by tendencies to epistemological and moral relativism, pluralism, irreverence and self-referentiality.[4]<br><br>Sound like post-modernism is shit like Jung and archetypes and shit.<br><br>Don&#039;t take the dictionary word for it. <br>You can&#039;t.

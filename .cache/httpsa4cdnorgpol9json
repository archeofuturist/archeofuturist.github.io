And this &quot;we need 60 votes&quot; is a very new rule, so that begs the question - who created that rule and why the number 60? The point is that over half of America voted for a republican Senate, a republican House, and a republican Presidency. Yet we are once again, as we did all eight years of Obama, handing everything to the dems. Everything the dems want, the dems get. There comes a point where you have to go back to the way our government was supposed to be run, and stand up for the will of the people. And the will of the people voted for republicans to push a very specific agenda, and the republicans, including Traitor Trump, are instead bowing down to the dems and doing the will of the globalist commies.<br><br>#FireKushner<br>#FireIvanka<br>#TraitorTrump","time":1493863641,"resto":123979684,"id":"RKy\/ffVX","country":"US","country_name":"United States"}]},{"posts":[{"no":123999283,"now":"05\/03\/17(Wed)21:43:34","name":"Anonymous","com":"Is this the new fedora?","filename":"maga","ext":".png","w":597,"h":486,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":203,"tim":1493862214315,"time":1493862214,"md5":"Rz0Hw\/YdP8\/LgBVeVocP+g==","fsize":506193,"resto":0,"id":"93Y5JUrs","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"is-this-the-new-fedora","country_name":"United States","replies":14,"images":6,"omitted_posts":9,"omitted_images":4},{"no":124001593,"now":"05\/03\/17(Wed)22:02:26","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p124001340\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;124001340<\/a><br>Shut the fuck up you kike shill cuck<br>\/pol\/ is only shit because of people like you","time":1493863346,"resto":123999283,"id":"vImAj2Gq","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":124001699,"now":"05\/03\/17(Wed)22:03:22","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p124001593\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;124001593<\/a><br>thanks for proving my point","filename":"1491693033607","ext":".jpg","w":640,"h":480,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":93,"tim":1493863402258,"time":1493863402,"md5":"oWSXvRjCxjmSesC3fpqQQg==","fsize":72281,"resto":123999283,"id":"AOEwuGRu","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":124001769,"now":"05\/03\/17(Wed)22:04:03","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p124001593\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;124001593<\/a><br>heh","time":1493863443,"resto":123999283,"id":"TvpJxoc8","country":"MX","country_name":"Mexico"},{"no":124001831,"now":"05\/03\/17(Wed)22:04:39","name":"Anonymous","com":"<span class=\"quote\">&gt;not wearing grab her by the brain hat<\/span>","filename":"people-are-really-pissed-over-this-grab-her-by-th-2-23154-1477146640-0_dblbig","ext":".jpg","w":625,"h":415,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":83,"tim":1493863479437,"time":1493863479,"md5":"YX+uMHC7cgoalUGrn9d+bA==","fsize":47675,"resto":123999283,"id":"sfkcQW47","country":"CA","country_name":"Canada"},{"no":124002065,"now":"05\/03\/17(Wed)22:06:39","name":"Anonymous","filename":"1485712192067","ext":".jpg","w":300,"h":360,"tn_w":104,"tn_h":125,"tim":1493863599746,"time":1493863599,"md5":"c2al8dkRdN90eAE0g+Gqog==","fsize":36540,"resto":123999283,"id":"Z0X9Nv6v","country":"PR","country_name":"Puerto Rico"}]},{"posts":[{"no":124000866,"now":"05\/03\/17(Wed)21:55:51","name":"Anonymous","sub":"An Antifa Recruitment Video: Men Should Wear Dresses For Equality","com":"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=_XN<wbr>4EQxucL8 - Antifa recruitment video revealing the Internet&#039;s freshest batch of cringe.

Hear me out. What we thought was a meme war was actually just a meme battle -- and we won. This comic will reach millions of normalfag liberals and they will get one thing out of it: how antagonizing memes influence their actions. They will understand how it is that our non-pc rhetoric affects their minds and influences their behavior. Essentially, our enemies have given up on their old tactics and have used us against ourselves. They tricked us into using memes to affect reality, like they do in the name of moloch via imbuing power in celebrities and sigils, we did in the name of kek or &#039;teh lulz&#039;, or whatever (and lets be honest - 4chan isn&#039;t one person, there are as many motivations as there are users) via our memes. It backfired on them and we managed to make some big changes, or so we thought. We played right into their hands. All their efforts are going towards using our memes as the vaccine to the mind viruses we create. As quickly as we gained power and influence we will lose it. By the end of the year the left will be completely immune to all of our tactics leaving us completely powerless against our greatest foe. The worst part is that there is nothing we can do about it at this point.

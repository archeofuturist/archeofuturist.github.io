I couldn&#039;t tell you one single person that was just casually drinking or even heavy drinking every weekend for fun, who got hooked.

It&#039;s mostly always the same system and has to do with dopamine and or gaba. So it was certainly important to get rid of the physical addiction, but it&#039;s way more important to find out the root of your problems and try to solve those as good as possible.

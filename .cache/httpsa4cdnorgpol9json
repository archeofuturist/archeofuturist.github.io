The Differentiating Function.<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;This function is based off of the last one.

The Selective Function.<br><br>- Or, simply, Darwinian Natural Selection. The structure of school is to assess the breeding quality of each individual child. The idea is to &quot;consciously improve the breeding stock.&quot; Teachers do this unknowingly, however; it&#039;s a structural harvest of information. What curators of this philosophy are looking for, to simplify things, are ways to prevent the &quot;poorer&quot; population, or the &quot;lower&quot; layers, from reproducing. They do this by encouraging shallow thought, humiliating students by labeling and dividing them, by teaching that sexual pleasure is the only valuable thing one can draw from a relationship, by trivializing spirituality and the unknown, and that short-term emotional gratification is liberating. Essentially, the principle of this function is that school acts as a mechanism for tagging the &quot;unfit&quot; by assigning them poor grades, remedial placement, etc., thus quantifying their inferiority, so that their peers will accept them as inferior, and the &quot;superior breeding stock&quot; among the opposite sex will reject whichever individual has failed this system of education.","filename":"1461040122296-2","ext":".jpg","w":1750,"h":1724,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":123,"tim":1493951793277,"time":1493951793,"md5":"cJz+7ZOx88xQ8Hx\/CGZC\/Q==","fsize":1153127,"resto":124151882,"id":"J2Aseko6","country":"US","m_img":1,"country_name":"United States"},{"no":124152556,"now":"05\/04\/17(Thu)22:39:40","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p124152189\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;124152189<\/a><br><br>6.

Is this feeling of hopelessness what it feels like when we&#039;ve ended our unhindered domination by lifting the uncivilized shit skins to being only a step beneath us (cause muh genetics) rather than a kilometer below? Perhaps the loss of our identity is simply the irony of winning so much that our hegemony over the earth and our christian kindness has resulted in such rapid advancement. Now we obviously don&#039;t want our path to be chosen by niggers, feminists, goat fuckers, and (((them))) but is there a way for us to live as near equals with, say east asians, whilst being guided by the obviously superior foundation of western civilization?","filename":"ef148d7a7fd3b1a562e27e0975175ccd-d6g523w","ext":".png","w":1297,"h":615,"tn_w":249,"tn_h":118,"tim":1492832161927,"time":1492832161,"md5":"6+Oapdq053RXEqAvGOQ3JA==","fsize":202337,"resto":0,"id":"3YghTpKZ","country":"CA","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"can-we-live-in-harmony-with-nonwhites-whilst","country_name":"Canada","replies":3,"images":1},{"no":122232371,"now":"04\/21\/17(Fri)23:56:30","name":"Anonymous","com":"Economic marxism was retarded, but it can relapse with cultural marxism. 2083 is the way.","filename":"1491399291104","ext":".jpg","w":640,"h":460,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":89,"tim":1492833390628,"time":1492833390,"md5":"pIc1NkxLkoGWqDE\/kHj2QQ==","fsize":68926,"resto":122230475,"id":"KRzEscZ4","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":122232502,"now":"04\/21\/17(Fri)23:57:51","name":"Anonymous","com":"Kill off the jews, niggers, and sandniggers if you want world peace.","time":1492833471,"resto":122230475,"id":"WZ1IaLf8","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":122232708,"now":"04\/22\/17(Sat)00:00:07","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122230475\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122230475<\/a><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;we<\/span><br><br>jej look at this leafass on his computer thinking he did something.

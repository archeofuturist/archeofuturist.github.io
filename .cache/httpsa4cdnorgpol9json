Yes, we know you don&#039;t like Trump and yes, we know you are upset that he won. But what are you trying to spin by saying Trump and Russia are colluding?<br><br>1. How did Russia steal the election from Hillary by showing the clearly undemocratic and unlawful ways the DNC was running their show? All it did was show that the DNC and their super delegates had Hillary coined as their nominee before the election process even started. Which people should be happy about knowing.<br><br>2. Russia had absolutely no idea Trump was going to win the election, just like everyone else had no idea. Everyone was surprised. <br><br>3. The Trump administration has not done anything that empowers Russia or done anything that would hint that Trump is a secret shill for Russia. The administration has been clear on where they stand with Ukraine, Crimea and other hot spots in the world. Trump has not done anything to weaken us.<br><br>4. Wasn&#039;t it the Obama administration that wanted to Buddy up to Iran, and gave them billions of dollars only for Iran to spit in our face? And wasn&#039;t it the Clinton&#039;s that sold Russia 20% of our Uranium? And wasn&#039;t it Obama that told Putin that he would be &quot;more flexible&quot; after the election?

This leads to males wanting to impregnate every female they can to ensure the survival of their genes, and the best way in their case is to take whatever you can and even if some are genetically inferior due to the female chosen, another surely will bare a healthy child. Females however need to choose whisely their partner to ensure good genes as they are heavily limited regarding the numbers of possible offsprings.<br><br>When now some other people come and threaten our lifestyle or rival us in any way we logically want to get rid of them one way or the other or make them more like you without you becomming more like them.

I am a nationalist, and nationalism implies every single ethnicity on Earth deserves a state and means of self-preservation. I love all peoples that choose to fight for what is just and honorable. But russians have to be like that, seeing many russians still praise soviet buchers is absolutely dehumanising. Fighting a brotherly war in Ukraine, for what purpose? One thing that made me question my chauvinism was that the majority of russian fascist volunteers went on to fight for Ukraine, not for Donbas alcoholics.","time":1491190044,"resto":119260145,"id":"nIoBJl3a","country":"LT","country_name":"Lithuania"},{"no":119285911,"now":"04\/02\/17(Sun)23:39:37","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119260145\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119260145<\/a><br>Is wafflekurd still going off?<br>I think it might be female.<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;tfw no angry little shitposting kurd waifu to biji your wiji into and BLEACHED.COM her<\/span><br>i think i&#039;ll live, lads, this one time","time":1491190777,"resto":119260145,"id":"JDdluAaJ","country":"US","country_name":"United States"}]},{"posts":[{"no":119277929,"now":"04\/02\/17(Sun)22:13:15","name":"Anonymous","com":"Hey \/pol\/<br><br>What war would you rather fight in:<br><br>World War 1 or World War 2","filename":"main-qimg-30e2d7f0331335ac1b2b99eb99d165dd","ext":".png","w":602,"h":361,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":149,"tim":1491185595610,"time":1491185595,"md5":"MOLX8DMTNawbK5nrmdFl3Q==","fsize":1136,"resto":0,"id":"aD3DxIDS","country":"AU","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"hey-pol","country_name":"Australia","replies":47,"images":13,"omitted_posts":42,"omitted_images":13},{"no":119281588,"now":"04\/02\/17(Sun)22:53:09","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119281134\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119281134<\/a>","filename":"1483189668678","ext":".png","w":1200,"h":802,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":83,"tim":1491187989918,"time":1491187989,"md5":"jZqlJ169ke+8AHuk9ofTgw==","fsize":2892769,"resto":119277929,"id":"qpD2XjBO","country":"DE","m_img":1,"country_name":"Germany"},{"no":119282071,"now":"04\/02\/17(Sun)22:58:18","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119281366\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119281366<\/a><br>im not the one shitting myself.","filename":"e3h3cDs","ext":".png","w":684,"h":676,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":123,"tim":1491188298443,"time":1491188298,"md5":"kMkQrihWV19+x8DH6OrJ8g==","fsize":630819,"resto":119277929,"id":"51er7RAJ","country":"AU","country_name":"Australia"},{"no":119282863,"now":"04\/02\/17(Sun)23:06:45","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119282071\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119282071<\/a><br>Because you&#039;re a 15 year old kid.<br><br>You&#039;ve probably never even been in a fight.<br><br>Go play Battlefield or something you giant retard","filename":"1491050884013","ext":".png","w":601,"h":599,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":124,"tim":1491188805796,"time":1491188805,"md5":"mkHUV1GTUB+z\/Mwix72e7w==","fsize":280157,"resto":119277929,"id":"R3tXZKsJ","country":"AU","country_name":"Australia"},{"no":119282969,"now":"04\/02\/17(Sun)23:07:47","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119281588\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119281588<\/a><br>ty, my dude","filename":"1451186331220","ext":".jpg","w":3696,"h":2645,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":89,"tim":1491188867658,"time":1491188867,"md5":"4wV7IEV2Zdd6\/G4KrE8iBA==","fsize":2104214,"resto":119277929,"id":"bboQR\/yh","country":"US","m_img":1,"country_name":"United States"},{"no":119284733,"now":"04\/02\/17(Sun)23:27:04","name":"Anonymous","com":"ww1 so i can get shellshock in my anus","time":1491190024,"resto":119277929,"id":"aD3DxIDS","country":"AU","country_name":"Australia"}]},{"posts":[{"no":119254794,"now":"04\/02\/17(Sun)18:26:50","name":"roachPrime","sub":"how many of you do this shit too","com":"<span class=\"quote\">&gt;see bad news<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;look up the people responsible<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;check their wikipedia page<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;check &quot;early life&quot;<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;see &quot;born into a Jewish househo- I FUCKING KNEW IT<\/span>","filename":"shlogirl","ext":".jpg","w":300,"h":430,"tn_w":174,"tn_h":250,"tim":1491172010775,"time":1491172010,"md5":"KjEvkjMICt0VSeMDg2ziVg==","fsize":18313,"resto":0,"id":"U9hEHHDs","country":"TR","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"how-many-of-you-do-this-shit-too","country_name":"Turkey","replies":154,"images":35,"omitted_posts":149,"omitted_images":33,"tail_size":50},{"no":119283714,"now":"04\/02\/17(Sun)23:15:41","name":"roachPrime","com":"<a href=\"#p119280535\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119280535<\/a><br>daymn angry burger shitkid<br>you seem to be confused with your positions here<br>go &quot;find yourself&quot;

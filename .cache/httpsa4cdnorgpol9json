My cousin got a huge TV through one of those rental companies, but then went full dindu nuffin when they came to take it away from her. Her excuse was that it wasn&#039;t in the contract. She didn&#039;t even read it.<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt; So why give them more incentive to keep doing crime and give them fewer opportunities and the mental toolbox needed to clime out of that life? <\/span><br>The solution is in their heads. They are the only ones that can start saving, they are the only ones that can remove cancerous people from their lives. You can&#039;t fix them with welfare. Welfare makes it worse.

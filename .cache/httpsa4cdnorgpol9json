The mothers get into a psychological condition where they&#039;re aware that sexual urges can stop their children from studying and feel that they are the best option for countering the craving. Some mothers will do anything to make sure their junior high school sons pass the all determining entrance exams. Studies show that almost 80% of Japanese men report they have had some form of sexual contact with their mothers with most of the sexual contact between mother and son beginning at a very early age. A boys childhood in contemporary Japan, although somewhat more Western than that of other Eastern nations, still includes masturbation by mothers &quot;to put them to sleep.&quot; Parents often have intercourse with their children in the same bed with them, and &quot;co-sleeping,&quot; with mothers physically embracing the child, routinely continues until the boy is ten or fifteen. One recent Japanese study found sons sleeping with their mothers over 20 percent of the time after age 16. A recent sex survey reported &quot;hot lines&quot; of sexual abuse saying that mother-son incest in almost a third of the calls, the mother saying to her teenage son, &quot;It&#039;s not good to do it alone. Your IQ becomes lower. I will help you, &quot; or &quot;You cannot study if you cannot have sex. You may use my body,&quot; or &quot;I don&#039;t want you to get into trouble with a girl. Have sex with me instead.&quot;<\/span>","filename":"War_flag_of_the_Imperial_Japanese_Army.svg","ext":".png","w":220,"h":147,"tn_w":220,"tn_h":147,"tim":1491523361315,"time":1491523361,"md5":"A1khBPS3vwCBpswGQOccAQ==","fsize":12362,"resto":0,"id":"\/upaekQy","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"japanese-birth-rates","country_name":"United States","replies":1,"images":0},{"no":119820113,"now":"04\/06\/17(Thu)20:06:37","name":"Anonymous","com":"The birth rate in Japan needs to fall.

One I would like to now bring back and make active again.<br><br>Remember in Atlanta how some anons with balls the size of church bells stood outside the fed with a variety of AR&#039;s, shotguns and slavshit for an hour? It was hard to miss because they rang when they walked. It was so damn loud they had noise complaints called on them from the terrified employees who couldn&#039;t figure out where the shoah was coming from. Then in Texas an attempt was made but it fell apart due to poor pre-planning. There probably still are willing anons there, and I hope you goys go for round two. Don&#039;t let a failure get to you. Learn from it and improve. You can do this!<br><br>This thread, however, is for a new location - Minneapolis. As some of you undoubtedly know there is a Federal Reserve Branch bank in downtown Minneapolis, and I plan on standing out there for an hour at noon on a Monday once a month starting 4-6 weeks from now. That gives 3 possible dates (depending on how you interpret 4-6 weeks) that I would like to start this series of protests. April 24th, May 1st, and May 8th. This is up for debate as people who want to join in will have things they have to do and schedules to keep. In any case, I will show up on one of those dates, even if I am alone.<br><br>Relevant links:<br><br>minneapolisfed.org\/ general info for the curious<br><br>minneapolisfed.org\/forms\/contact contains address that you can copy\/paste in any map you want<br><br>90 Hennepin Ave, Minneapolis, MN 55401","filename":"d543f715ba9647aef2ffe299950287a0fe9618e5c1679c31cacd0dc7d2d8764d[1]","ext":".jpg","w":600,"h":400,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":166,"tim":1490767508363,"time":1490767508,"md5":"V+c4tqEMY480IS4ghwXCSQ==","fsize":52371,"resto":0,"id":"dT88hS+X","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"federal-reserve-protest","country_name":"United States","replies":2,"images":0},{"no":118754913,"now":"03\/29\/17(Wed)02:05:27","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118754879\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118754879<\/a><br>Any anons who are able and willing to attend are encouraged to do so.

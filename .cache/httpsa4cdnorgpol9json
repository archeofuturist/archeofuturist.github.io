They&#039;re pretty opinionated, and we talk politics fairly regularly.<br><br>They&#039;re a pair of lifelong leftists. My dad unironically supports Marxism and &#039;equality&#039;, and yet often he&#039;ll talk negatively about Muslims. They&#039;re both about as socially conservative as the old left types get (not very, but better than the dildo left), but both watch the BBC and only the BBC for news.<br><br>They still listen to me, and more often than not end up agreeing with me (I&#039;m not pushy - I let them start the discussions). But every time I think I&#039;ve redpilled them on any given topic, even entry level shit like the Muslim problem, within days, maybe hours, they will revert back to the default position of &#039;muzzos dindu nuffin, nationalism rayciss!&#039; (we&#039;re not niggers, but that&#039;s the level of thinking we&#039;re talking). Basically, they just wait for the BBC to tell them what to think after any given event.<br><br>This morning they were kvetching about how terrorism isn&#039;t terrorism, it&#039;s just individuals acting because they&#039;re bad people. They unironically think that just because white people today are completely atomised individuals acting in a raceless, cultureless vacuum, every other race is the same.<br><br>And then they started whinging about how hard the Muslims have it because they&#039;ll be judged for this, and how terrible it is that it helps groups like &#039;the BNP&#039; (this is how out of touch they are) and UKIP (as if we don&#039;t hate being proven right). They talk about how they don&#039;t want a &#039;fascist&#039; state, but they don&#039;t realise that this country is already basically a police state where white people get surveilled and imprisoned for having the wrong views, meanwhile openly treasonous Muslims are released from jail and allowed to kill our people in the streets.<br><br>What can be done? How can we convince people like this, who have endured a lifetime of liberal brainwashing, to do the right thing? They obviously can&#039;t be reasoned with, so how can we counter-brainwash them?","filename":"1484082914833","ext":".jpg","w":482,"h":427,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":221,"tim":1490346030139,"time":1490346030,"md5":"vc9PyV6hVXh4tvzOQ2ld+w==","fsize":40097,"resto":0,"id":"YNZDgL6R","country":"GB","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"what-can-we-do-about-gen-x","country_name":"United Kingdom","replies":96,"images":8,"omitted_posts":91,"omitted_images":7},{"no":118071490,"now":"03\/24\/17(Fri)07:31:58","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118065872\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118065872<\/a><br>t. cable watching pleb","filename":"NormieFamily","ext":".jpg","w":246,"h":205,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":104,"tim":1490355118791,"time":1490355118,"md5":"Y2R3kbYxO25ZQFHFYKS98g==","fsize":16728,"resto":118061888,"id":"R+r605dI","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":118071739,"now":"03\/24\/17(Fri)07:34:51","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118065743\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118065743<\/a><br>Agree with this.

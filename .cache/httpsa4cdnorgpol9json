With the hashtag above, as well as some other simple tricks, we spread the notion that the banks have no currency in their vaults, causing people to withdraw all of their cash from the banks. I know people have been floating the idea around here for a while, so it&#039;ll be easy! Many people don&#039;t trust banks anyways, so to convince them to withdraw all of their money will be a cakewalk. Here&#039;s the beauty of it, since it&#039;s the weekend, the banks won&#039;t be open and we can cause maximum awareness before Monday. This not only causes problems for the banks, it causes problems for (((them))) as well. Plus, if they try to acknowledge it or down play it, more people will become aware and question the authority\/legitimacy of the banks.

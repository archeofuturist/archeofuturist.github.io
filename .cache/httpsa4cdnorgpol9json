In order to impress her he returns to islam. When her father finds out,he doesn&#039;t allow him to marry her until he becomes fully devout. He loses respect from his family and his career in order to be more devout to faith. <br><br>Meanwhile,she is forced to be even more devout and she undergoes heavy sharia life practice. She gets ill from abuse and eventually dies.The guy finds out it was because of him and falls into severe depression. He goes to US but becomes more religious,in order to make up for suffering. He meets some christian girl and starts going out with her to feel better. He also starts to make her convert to muslimah but then she loses her family and then starts to undergo sharia lifestyle.<br><br>He realizes she is also suffering just like the girl that died and in the end leaves her,for her to not have same fate. When he comes back to Pakistan he loses respect from religious community and still can&#039;t back to his family and friends and realizes religion destroyed him and gives up on it. <br><br>Basically lose everything ,but still happy that you are red pilled.","filename":"K34tz2ijjhsdhf","ext":".jpg","w":720,"h":576,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":200,"tim":1493054291714,"time":1493054291,"md5":"9lQKepZcd1QKnOxCs\/oczQ==","fsize":34045,"resto":0,"id":"zfYJ5ntD","country":"HR","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"finished-watching-a-paki-series-called-khuda-aur","country_name":"Croatia","replies":21,"images":1,"omitted_posts":16,"omitted_images":1},{"no":122618675,"now":"04\/24\/17(Mon)14:26:40","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122609880\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122609880<\/a><br>Ill check it.<br>I&#039;ll watch shitskin films\/shows.<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Children of God<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Kite Runner<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;The Raid<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Zire Tigh<\/span>","time":1493058400,"resto":122609880,"id":"eHtFLJVE","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":122619122,"now":"04\/24\/17(Mon)14:30:23","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122609880\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122609880<\/a><br>This is the gayest thread I have ever seen.<br><br>Are you guys talking about a fucking Indian Lifetime movie?<br>What are you a bunch of fucking menstruating women damn.","time":1493058623,"resto":122609880,"id":"n8y3bqTG","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":122619238,"now":"04\/24\/17(Mon)14:31:21","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122619122\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122619122<\/a><br>It&#039;s easy spotting a fellow panjeet, kek","time":1493058681,"resto":122609880,"id":"kA+xA06a","country":"IN","country_name":"India"},{"no":122619347,"now":"04\/24\/17(Mon)14:32:05","name":"Anonymous","com":"This sucha typical belgain post","time":1493058725,"resto":122609880,"id":"QO5fpibO","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":122619958,"now":"04\/24\/17(Mon)14:37:12","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122609880\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122609880<\/a><br>wow, its almost like islam is a satanic cult that feeds on suffering.<br><br>Really makes you think","time":1493059032,"resto":122609880,"id":"\/43EPqZx","country":"SE","country_name":"Sweden"}]},{"posts":[{"no":122619414,"now":"04\/24\/17(Mon)14:32:39","name":"Anonymous","com":"<span class=\"quote\">&gt; In Zurich (ritch bitch of Switzerland), the number of burglaries falls sharply, the opposite is happening in Germany.

contention, like this idiot <a href=\"\/pol\/thread\/121884988#p121897764\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121897764<\/a>, which is essentially the same as trying to invoke some kind of &quot;big words&quot; fallacy. To contest that an argument is unsound because its words aren&#039;t explicitly defined, and because words have an infinite number of possible definitions (between what number of definitions is irrelevant), is a continuum fallacy. All words already have a finite number of implicit definitions. The principle of charity dictates that, when a word in an argument isn&#039;t explicitly defined, you simply choose whichever pre-existent, implicit definition (which exist for all words) would make the argument sound. This is obvious with arguments with &#039;little&#039; words, and it doesn&#039;t change for arguments with &#039;big&#039; words - &#039;big&#039; words don&#039;t objectively exist.

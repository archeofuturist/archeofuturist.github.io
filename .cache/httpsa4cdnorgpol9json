Until assault is proved, no action is taken by the state against the &quot;husband&quot; actor until there is a conviction of assault beyond reasonable doubt. <br><br>So there are two broad categories of cases in court criminal cases and civil cases. Generally in criminal cases the defendant must be proved guilty beyond a reasonable doubt and in civil cases the standard is preponderance of the evidence. (51% in your favor basically).<br><br>The situation you are describing sounds like a civil order of protection. This is a civil legal proceeding in which the petitioner seeks a court order, ordering the respondent to remain a certain distance away from the petitioner and avoid all contact etc. This generally occurs in two stages. The initial appearance in which the petitioner can seek a temporary order of protection and the final evidentiary hearing in which the petitioner seeks a final and more long lasting order of protection. The temporary order can usually only last a certain time period by statute, but is also on a lower standard than must be met for the final order. Generally the petitioner merely has to state a sufficient case and he or she is not really grilled by anyone on their case or evidence. Usually the respondent isn&#039;t even present though the respondent would have the right to be present. The temporary order is almost always granted. Because it is a lower standard and there is political\/cultural pressure on Judges to grant these orders to prevent potential harm.","time":1493921981,"resto":124079279,"id":"HgZ551Gu","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":124090644,"now":"05\/04\/17(Thu)14:30:10","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p124087891\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;124087891<\/a><br><a href=\"#p124088014\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;124088014<\/a><br><a href=\"#p124089330\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;124089330<\/a><br> cont.<br><br>So the same rules of evidence apply regardless if it is a woman or man.

I&#039;ve seen clients try to act like they are happy and maybe exclaim &#039;Yay it&#039;s finally over!&quot; or maybe state they are going to have a celebratory night out or something. But it has always stuck me as that person faking it. Divorce sucks for all involved.

They are incentivized, through the legal system, to find a man, have kids with him, and fleece him for his house, kids, and money. <\/span><br><br>I have never encountered a woman who I thought merely married a man to divorce him and get his money. I am certain that happens. I just haven&#039;t encountered it. In the standard run of the mill case I encounter it is usually a man and woman of similar educational background and probably similar earning potential wind up getting a divorce. Almost always it is the woman that files for divorce. And she will usually give a laundry list of reasons why, he doesn&#039;t do this, this this, or this, blah blah blah, but it comes down to she is not happy. Usually at this point the relationship has already degraded to the point where divorce might be the only feasible option.<br><br>But I think one main reason for this is that people, especially women frequently go into marriage with false expectations. They think marriage is this thing that happens and then everything in their life gets better and they are going to be happy all the time and feel loved all the time and all the other fairy-tale bullshit","time":1493922610,"resto":124079279,"id":"HgZ551Gu","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":124090968,"now":"05\/04\/17(Thu)14:33:01","name":"Anonymous","com":"Fuck Ronald Reagan.","filename":"goldwater","ext":".jpg","w":600,"h":600,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":125,"tim":1493922781390,"time":1493922781,"md5":"m7MYHDDrJVGQcWhIpRd3pw==","fsize":244575,"resto":124079279,"id":"gZ1KzztO","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":124091193,"now":"05\/04\/17(Thu)14:34:48","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p124087891\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;124087891<\/a><br><a href=\"#p124088014\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;124088014<\/a><br><a href=\"#p124089330\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;124089330<\/a><br><a href=\"#p124090644\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;124090644<\/a><br><br>cont.<br><br>When this doesn&#039;t happen they decide it must be because their marriage has failed and they would be happier if they got divorced.

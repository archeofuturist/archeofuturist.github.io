These men and women play an important community role closely connected with our nation&#039;s defense. If a military draft becomes necessary, approximately 2,000 local boards throughout the United States, territories, and the District of Columbia would decide who among the registrants in their community will receive deferments, postponements, or exemption from military service based on the individual registrant&#039;s circumstances and beliefs.&quot;<br><br>Today this post was made by another user:<br><br>&quot;I have been volunteering as a board member of the SSS for over ten years.

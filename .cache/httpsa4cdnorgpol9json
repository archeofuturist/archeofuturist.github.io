The guy named Marco (Latin, meaning \u201cwarlike\u201d), ran on a platform of neoconservative imperialism.

Bernie connected his first name with fire early on, eg \u201cFeel The Bern\u201d; his surname derives from Greek Alexander, \u201cdefender of man\u201d. Put together, we get \u201cdefender of the fired man\u201d, eg a supporter of the unemployed and underemployed. But Hillary Clinton, named for Sir Edmund Hillary (whose own name combines \u201chill\u201d and \u201caerie\u201d, two words for high places) quickly climbed to the top. She became the clear favorite after narrowly defeating Sanders in Iowa, a state granted disproportionate power in Presidential elections presumably because its name is the Tetragrammaton.<br><br>The general election followed a similar pattern. Seemingly unconcerned with Genesis 4:5, Clinton chose a man named Kaine as her vice-president; seemingly unconcerned with nominative determinism, she chose a man named Mook to run her campaign. Meanwhile, Trump relied increasingly on the public relations machine of the mainstream Republican Party and its leader Reince Priebus \u2013 whose name, if you remove the vowels after the Hebrew fashion, becomes \u201cRNC PR BS\u201d.","filename":"1451930251939","ext":".jpg","w":500,"h":377,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":188,"tim":1491518085861,"time":1491518085,"md5":"ZEIUnSwlU0fXu1r5MAWnOA==","fsize":19715,"resto":0,"id":"MARWbp5y","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"the-2016-republican-primaries-went-the-way-any","country_name":"United States","replies":3,"images":0},{"no":119807918,"now":"04\/06\/17(Thu)18:38:57","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119807289\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119807289<\/a><br>The books predicted the 2016 election. There is only one structure in the universe, distort it however many times you may. Any story you like is the same story. The Bible. Huckleberry Finn. The 2016 Presidential election. They\u2019re all the same.<br><br>There&#039;s one book, however, that made it very obvious. C. S. Lewis\u2019 The Lion, The Witch, And The Wardrobe. <br><br>The lion represents Trump. He\u2019s big and predatory and has a mane of golden hair. Heck, even the political cartoonists have got this one; they\u2019ve been drawing the theme of the lion attacking the elephant all year. The witch represents Hillary. She\u2019s a powerful but widely-disliked old woman. The wardrobe is the Presidency. Everything about the executive branch is wardrobe-themed. The Cabinet. The various Bureaus. So The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe is a book about Trump, Hillary, and the Presidency.<br><br>Narnia corresponds to America. We know this because a bunch of English people get in a big wooden container and end up in a freezing forested land far away that they know nothing about. That\u2019s basically the story of how America was founded in the first place. The four children represent the four great English migrations to the New World \u2013 read Albion\u2019s Seed. <br><br>We\u2019ve got America, menaced by the White Witch \u2013 here meaning leftism in general and Hillary in particular. In Lewis\u2019 legendarium, the White Witch has betrayed her people by using a magic spell called \u2018the Deplorable Word\u2019; Hillary betrays her people by using the word \u2018deplorable\u2019 to describe them. In Lewis\u2019 time, the word \u2018Turk\u2019 was a metonymy for all Muslims, as it was almost two centuries earlier when Blake wrote about loving \u2018Christian, Turk, and Jew\u2019. So the White Witch luring Edmund by promising him of Turkish Delight corresponds to Hillary luring the American people by promising benefits from increased Muslim immigration. Enter Aslan. Trump is the only person who can stand up to Hillary and her liberal wizardry.","time":1491518337,"resto":119807289,"id":"MARWbp5y","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":119808354,"now":"04\/06\/17(Thu)18:41:58","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119807918\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119807918<\/a><br>In the book, Aslan is tied to a stone table and killed. The White Witch\u2019s victory seems assured. What are polls but tables of numbers? Trump was being slaughtered in the polls, but he made an impossible comeback. The point is, The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe tells the story of the confrontation between Trump and Clinton, how Clinton\u2019s promises of a more diverse society are originally attractive, how Trump loses everything according to the polls, and how he makes an astonishing comeback at the end.<br><br>Upon Obama\u2019s election, I had commented that a Lovecraft poem beginning \u201cAnd at the last, from Inner Egypt\u2026\u201d seemed to predict that he would be the final President. I was wrong. The prophecy was overruled by a higher authority, the Bible itself, which simply says (1 Corinthians 15:52) \u201cAt the last, Trump\u201d.<br><br>The word King James\u2019 scholars translated as \u201ctrump\u201d is Greek salpinx \/ Hebrew shofar, which receives various other English translations in different verses. If we interpret it to mean Trump each time, we get all sorts of other interesting prophecies. For example, Isaiah 27:13 says that in the day of \u201ca great Trump\u201d, there \u201cshall come those which were ready to perish in the land of Assyria\u201d, which is a clearer description of Iraqi refugees trying to enter the country than you would have expected from someone living in 600 BC.<br><br>But really, you don\u2019t need to bring out the big guns to figure this stuff out. Trump\u2019s presidency went the way any nominative determinist would have predicted. The guy named Price vowed to make healthcare affordable. The guy named Sessions inspired endless congressional hearings. The guy named Spicer made press conferences a lot more interesting.

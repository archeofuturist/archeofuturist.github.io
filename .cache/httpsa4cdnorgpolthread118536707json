They also attend &quot;local Oktoberfests.&quot; These people are so disconected that they probably don&#039;t even know the name of the capital city in Germany.","time":1490641443,"resto":118536707,"id":"qm716ny2","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":118546834,"now":"03\/27\/17(Mon)15:04:51","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118546281\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118546281<\/a><br>Some small things.<br>My actual nazi german grandfather was captured in Italy during the war when they switched sides. <br>But I think the Italians were bros and he only ever hated the french.<br>2006 was also a funny year as a half-german half-italian.<br><br>The trick is to find what unites Germans and Italians.<br>The big three are<br>Soccer<br>Fascism <br>and Bud Spencer and Terrence Hill movies.","time":1490641491,"resto":118536707,"id":"K0XG5gpI","country":"DE","country_name":"Germany"},{"no":118546899,"now":"03\/27\/17(Mon)15:05:18","name":"Anonymous","com":"They identify as &quot;Americans&quot; <br><br>We have a thread like this every fucking week","time":1490641518,"resto":118536707,"id":"HsT8L8H5","country":"CA","country_name":"Canada"},{"no":118546941,"now":"03\/27\/17(Mon)15:05:36","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118542713\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118542713<\/a><br>The Hillary votes were the Irish and Wop trash. <br><br>If they weren&#039;t hopeless we could have flipped New York.","time":1490641536,"resto":118536707,"id":"1Ti0b56p","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":118546999,"now":"03\/27\/17(Mon)15:05:58","name":"Anonymous","com":"<span class=\"quote\">&gt;mfw all these krauts, potatoes, wops and mexicans around me<\/span><br><br>This is my nation.

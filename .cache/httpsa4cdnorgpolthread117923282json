It means that for every generation, the number of native white europeans halves. The majority of families have only one child, that means the child replaces only one parent.<br>Never in the history of mankind the Europeans have been so tolerant and willing to kill their own culture and simply hand over the countries they built.<br>Thanks to the Stockholm Syndrome epidemic that seems to strike the majority of Whites, they won&#039;t realize that once they lose power, once they are the minority in their own countries, all the human rights (women&#039;s rights, LGBTQuerty rights, freedom of religion) that they achieved to implement in the last century will be thrown off the window by a culture that is not compatible by design with these rights.<br>Tolerating the intolerant, bowing your head in fear of being called racist by a culture that made the same mistakes your ancestors did, fighting for those that will throw you in the ditch once they get on their feet, is the recipe of total cultural suicide.<br>What we have seen and read about Christianity with the dark history, is nothing of what will happen to the world when Islam takes over.<br>Islam is much powerful by design, it was not created not by a Hipster like Christianity was, but by a warmonger that pillaged, killed entire villages, raped women and had sex with underage girls (age 9.

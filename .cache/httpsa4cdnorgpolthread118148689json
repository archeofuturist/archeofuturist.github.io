Historically speaking, shouldn&#039;t communism be the enemy of Islam and vice versa? Seeing as communism is (mostly) atheist and has in the case of the USSR reduced the Islamic number (I suppose) through actual education without the religious bullshit. I found this on Wikipedia quite interesting: When Joseph Stalin consolidated power in the second half of the 1920s, his religion policy changed. Mosques were closed or turned into warehouses throughout Central Asia. Religious leaders were persecuted, religious schools were closed down and Waqf&#039;s were outlawed.[6] The Soviet government took the paranji veil that the women wore (as part of the Islamic hijab interpretation of modesty) as evidence that the Muslim women were oppressed.<br>Link:https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/<wbr>Islam_in_the_Soviet_Union<br>Not to mention the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan and what followed from the Americans essentially creating the Taliban by giving these radical Muslims (the Mujaheddin) weapons.","filename":"Evstafiev-afghan-apc-passes-russian","ext":".jpg","w":700,"h":466,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":166,"tim":1490397295027,"time":1490397295,"md5":"lfDmYJ7NrmKm4AWcRCcZkQ==","fsize":310116,"resto":0,"id":"1iUYDvi6","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"communismstalinism-and-islam","country_name":"United States","replies":6,"images":0,"unique_ips":6},{"no":118149333,"now":"03\/24\/17(Fri)19:19:54","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118148689\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118148689<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;he still thinks the USSR was communist <\/span><br>Anything after Lenin was LARPing.

You should google about struggle for Central Asian and Caucasian republics and Lenin&#039;s policies there. It&#039;s pretty interesting and is exactly what some modern gommies argue for. He sent a lot of russians to concentrations camps, elevated local muslim leaders to party leadership positions there and so on.

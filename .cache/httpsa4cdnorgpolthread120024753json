While Israel is fanatically obsessed with Iran and while the Iranians are Israel&#039;s worst enemy, Syria, despite being a part of the Shia crescent is absolutely not Israel&#039;s worst enemy, in fact they actually like him being their neighbour. There was an Israeli foreign minister was saying that the situation which helps Israel&#039;s security interests the most is having an illegitimate leader of a country as their neighbour, because it essentially provides moral equivalence with Israel&#039;s more amoral \/ immoral actions against the Palestinians and it takes the attention off of them. <br><br>The fact that Assad is seen as illegitimate by most of the Sunni Arab world is a huge boon to Israel and him being in charge actually helps Israel and their security. Also, the Syrians pose absolutely no threat to Israel whatsoever, the only way they threaten Syria is by hosting Hezbollah. That&#039;s not even going into the fact that Israel know the Assad regime&#039;s modus operandi, even before he became president in 2000. He&#039;s a known enemy; if he was deposed, Israel would have a hostile Qatari puppet state next to them.<br><br>Cliffs: Only Hezbollah and Iran are threats to Israel. Assad is not a threat to Syria and in fact aids their security and diplomatic interests, as long as he is considered illegitimate by the Arab and Western world. <br><br>That does not mean he should be toppled. I support Assad 100%. I&#039;m just saying that it&#039;s a simplification to say Israel is opposed to him.","time":1491600375,"resto":120024753,"id":"Nn2wvj8U","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"}]}

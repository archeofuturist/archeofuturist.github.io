Let&#039;s say some enterprising young goyim wants to start a roofing business after saving up some capital. He buys a van and necessary supplies\/tools, and he starts getting clients. In order for him to meet his quotas, he needs to hire workers. Roofing doesn&#039;t take a whole lot of skill, but it&#039;s shitty and not many Americans are willing to do it. Those who do typically will demand a wage somewhere around $12 an hour. However, goyim business owner can hire illegals and pay them under the table for $8 an hour, for the same quality of work. Therefore, he gets the same results cheaper, and he can profit more and expand his business, making him richer. The illegal will live a hand to mouth lifestyle, the under the table money will go straight back into the economy. At the end of the equation, we have a richer American who will have a successful business and spend his money in economically good ways, like a mortgage and car payment. The illegal stays poor, but it&#039;s better than the shithole they came from so they don&#039;t mind. If he had to pay a worker demanding American wages, the business would not be as profitable, and the entry-level laborer would still be making a working class wage. He would either keep living a mediocre and frugal lifestyle, or he would jump ship after a while at the goyim business owner&#039;s expense.","time":1491883578,"resto":120547497,"id":"g4nabZjf","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":120550592,"now":"04\/11\/17(Tue)00:11:19","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120547497\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120547497<\/a><br>I can&#039;t believe I voted for that conman","filename":"Shareblue-Sample-COPY-0-9","ext":".png","w":411,"h":600,"tn_w":85,"tn_h":125,"tim":1491883879610,"time":1491883879,"md5":"HLcRljldNIRoqr1js12sXw==","fsize":116038,"resto":120547497,"id":"qO7jD8WU","country":"CA","country_name":"Canada"},{"no":120550901,"now":"04\/11\/17(Tue)00:14:16","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120547497\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120547497<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Shareblue-Sample<\/span><br>oh my fucking god...","filename":"bait","ext":".jpg","w":600,"h":600,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":125,"tim":1491884056422,"time":1491884056,"md5":"vE4jQELjCdc6agE6TibR0w==","fsize":16726,"resto":120547497,"id":"jOwAf9Iw","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":120551271,"now":"04\/11\/17(Tue)00:17:23","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120547497\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120547497<\/a><br>Can&#039;t believe we supported the fat orange retard","filename":"1491881406227m","ext":".jpg","w":1024,"h":379,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":46,"tim":1491884243743,"time":1491884243,"md5":"v5e87vFAHf1P6decTuN61Q==","fsize":68374,"resto":120547497,"id":"TkxBAlOb","country":"BR","country_name":"Brazil"},{"no":120551368,"now":"04\/11\/17(Tue)00:18:17","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120547497\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120547497<\/a><br>Japan needs more immigrants too!","filename":"1483768317365","ext":".png","w":259,"h":350,"tn_w":92,"tn_h":125,"tim":1491884297950,"time":1491884297,"md5":"9\/xtGdYHJw9DpW7Fg0sCFw==","fsize":70153,"resto":120547497,"id":"PDmJbmk0","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":120551621,"now":"04\/11\/17(Tue)00:20:39","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120547497\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120547497<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Shareblue-Sample-COPY-0-7.jpg<\/span><br><a href=\"#p120547956\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120547956<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Shareblue-Sample-04.jpg <\/span><br><a href=\"#p120548152\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120548152<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Shareblue-Sample-01.jpg <\/span><br><a href=\"#p120550592\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120550592<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Shareblue-Sample-COPY-0-9.png <\/span><br>Did they hire a new command or it&#039;s trolling?","time":1491884439,"resto":120547497,"id":"vic3ho2E","country":"RU","country_name":"Russian Federation"},{"no":120552368,"now":"04\/11\/17(Tue)00:27:14","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120551621\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120551621<\/a><br>I think there retarded ruski","time":1491884834,"resto":120547497,"id":"jOwAf9Iw","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":120554494,"now":"04\/11\/17(Tue)00:45:09","name":"Anonymous","filename":"IMG_2306","ext":".jpg","w":1480,"h":1143,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":96,"tim":1491885909729,"time":1491885909,"md5":"OlZGqeW\/VWEKVrWME8Z8NQ==","fsize":218204,"resto":120547497,"id":"z4+pjfTr","country":"US","m_img":1,"country_name":"United States"}]}

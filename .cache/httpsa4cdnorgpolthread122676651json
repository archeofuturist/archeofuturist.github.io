I worked my ass off from 18-23. I went from delivering pizza&#039;s to landing a security job to becoming a supervisor in said security job to getting into law enforcement. I had one recruiter tell me education would have helped make me a bit more competitive but that because so many people apply without work experience, volunteer experience and just with a piece of paper from a university that the applicant pools are favoured towards work experience. <br><br>Guess what? I make over 60,000$ a year now starting without a degree, with no university debt. Meanwhile retards like you went in laid around for 4 years studying for tests and now cant find a job and don&#039;t understand why. <br><br>Now you&#039;re going to have to go flip burgers at mcdonalds just to climb the ladder to show you are actually employable. <br><br>If you are going to go thousands of dollars into debt in university make sure you are at least working and volunteering. That&#039;s not possible for many university students though because their course loads are so retarded they have no time to do anything other then go to school and study. <br><br>I don&#039;t know what to tell you man really. I&#039;m honestly starting to think the 2 year diploma + work experience might have been the best bet, but even then you&#039;re going to be taking from your work experience. <br><br>I remember one applicant I was up against prior to the interview talking and he had a loaded resume, BA in criminology, graduated with honours etc anyway the guy ended up failing the interview because he couldn&#039;t demonstrate he had the experience for the required competencies while I passed with just a highschool education but shit tons of work experience. He messaged me after and couldn&#039;t believe it, dude actually thought he was entitled to a job because of a piece of paper.","filename":"money33","ext":".jpg","w":704,"h":400,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":71,"tim":1493088563249,"time":1493088563,"md5":"JD2R0\/jhYw65KZdOyIUBYQ==","fsize":69836,"resto":122676651,"id":"MwIYsMJN","country":"CA","country_name":"Canada"},{"no":122681280,"now":"04\/24\/17(Mon)22:49:41","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122679769\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122679769<\/a><br>can i live in your house as a NEET?

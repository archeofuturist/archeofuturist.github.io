I don&#039;t think anyone argues those places are shit places to live.<br><br>The thing is, it it our place to remove the leaders over there? Could there be some reason the population put up with it and removing the leader through conflict would create hatred towards us? Remember Iraq? As much or a scumbag Saddam was there was no Islamic terrorists in that country before our invasion. He DID provide stability in an unstable area of the words.<br><br>Holding those countries to our standards is unfair. <br><br>This is why we should be avoiding Syria, not picking sides. The people there seem to want ISIS over Assad, personally I don&#039;t want us to ally with any of them or have any responsibility to ether&#039;s &quot;success&quot;. But it&#039;s not our place to choose for them. Let them fight for it. <br><br>The EU&#039;s humanitarian bullshit of letting in &quot;refugees&quot; is giving people who could be fighting for a country they want an easy exit. They don&#039;t want ISIS or Assad, so they retreat.<br><br>We are not world police. Our efforts should have been to prevent Russian involvement in Syria. Let the country evolve in a way the people there want.","time":1490829169,"resto":118847149,"id":"wlNJJ\/6Q","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":118849196,"now":"03\/29\/17(Wed)19:18:17","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118847149\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118847149<\/a><br><a href=\"#p118847642\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118847642<\/a><br>youre a disgrace to all americans because you are a statist bootlicker<br>keep sucking your democracy down","time":1490829497,"resto":118847149,"id":"WCGJJwSA","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":118849441,"now":"03\/29\/17(Wed)19:20:51","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118849196\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118849196<\/a><br>That&#039;s not an argument","time":1490829651,"resto":118847149,"id":"BbIFXdWl","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":118849624,"now":"03\/29\/17(Wed)19:22:30","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118847149\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118847149<\/a><br><br>Eh, both countries can do what they want, as far as I&#039;m concerned, outside of randomly threatening to nuke other countries for money. As far as it goes, Syria actually has a reason to be a dictatorship - that&#039;s what holds the country together, as it would otherwise fall prey to sectarian violence. North Korea has no such issues, and South Korea is a much better solution for its people.","time":1490829750,"resto":118847149,"id":"M38+JpVE","country":"US","country_name":"United States"}]}

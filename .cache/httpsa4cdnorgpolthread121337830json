class=\"quote\">&gt;Its Chaldean Origin<\/span><br>Easter, as Alexander Hislop says (The Two Babylons, p. 103), &quot;bears its Chaldean origin on its very forehead. Easter is nothing else than Astarte, one of the titles of Beltis, the queen of heaven. . . .&quot;<br>The ancient gods of the pagans had many different names. While this goddess was called Astarte by the Phoenicians, it appears on Assyrian monuments found by Layard in excavations at Nineveh as Ishtar (Austen H. Layard, Nineveh and Babylon, Vol. II, p. 629). Both were pronounced &quot;Easter.&quot; Likewise, Bel (referred to in the Old Testament), also was called Molech. It was for sacrificing to Molech (I Kings 11:1-11, especially verse 7, where Molech is called an abomination) and other pagan gods that the Eternal condemned Solomon, and rended away the Kingdom of Israel from his son.<br>In the ancient Chaldean idolatrous sun-worship, as practiced by the Phoenicians, Baal was the sun god; Astarte, his consort or wife. And Astarte is the same as Ishtar, or the English &quot;Easter.&quot;<br>Says Hislop: &quot;The festival, of which we read in Church history, under the name of Easter, in the third or fourth centuries, was quite a different festival from that now observed in the Romish [and Protestant] Church, and at that time was not known by any such name as Easter. It was called Pascha, or the Passover, and . . . was very early observed by many professing Christians. . . . That festival agreed originally with the time of the Jewish Passover, when Christ was crucified. . . . That festival was not idolatrous, and it was preceded by no Lent&quot; (The Two Babylons, p. 104).<br><br>I can&#039;t believe you guys missed Passover.<br>http:\/\/www.cgg.org\/index.cfm\/fuseac<wbr>tion\/Library.CGGWeekly\/ID\/527\/Why-P<wbr>assover-Not-Easter.htm","time":1492333319,"resto":121337830,"id":"vWlwIDg+","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":121339067,"now":"04\/16\/17(Sun)05:02:46","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121337830\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121337830<\/a><br>Jews did it again.","time":1492333366,"resto":121337830,"id":"na6PLPEm","country":"RO","country_name":"Romania"},{"no":121339090,"now":"04\/16\/17(Sun)05:03:06","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121338825\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121338825<\/a><br>Yes well, Happy Easter to you too!","time":1492333386,"resto":121337830,"id":"8kuZlzhP","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":121339098,"now":"04\/16\/17(Sun)05:03:08","name":"Anonymous","com":"(You)","filename":"f-pope-a-20160326","ext":".jpg","w":3500,"h":2546,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":90,"tim":1492333388431,"time":1492333388,"md5":"u0qohtd3hovXa+v6QOTbBQ==","fsize":1083316,"resto":121337830,"id":"YjqN4QGQ","country":"SE","m_img":1,"country_name":"Sweden"},{"no":121339110,"now":"04\/16\/17(Sun)05:03:26","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121338994\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121338994<\/a><br>You seriously can&#039;t speak<br>Get a proxy or something, please!","filename":"sweden","ext":".jpg","w":640,"h":333,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":65,"tim":1492333406438,"time":1492333406,"md5":"etaBYcKRqbXtG6kXT5Rd3Q==","fsize":52198,"resto":121337830,"id":"OCKcZGTx","country":"HR","country_name":"Croatia"},{"no":121339138,"now":"04\/16\/17(Sun)05:03:50","name":"Anonymous","filename":"Pope-washes-feet-019","ext":".jpg","w":620,"h":413,"tn_w":124,"tn_h":83,"tim":1492333430302,"time":1492333430,"md5":"hulBL5XuH6BEnAUagbqDQg==","fsize":39327,"resto":121337830,"id":"YjqN4QGQ","country":"SE","country_name":"Sweden"},{"no":121339213,"now":"04\/16\/17(Sun)05:04:54","name":"Anonymous","com":"Why won&#039;t he stop?","filename":"pope","ext":".jpg","w":3500,"h":2329,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":83,"tim":1492333494063,"time":1492333494,"md5":"hSk3rg4pN64LPNwJkOzhLw==","fsize":1163785,"resto":121337830,"id":"YjqN4QGQ","country":"SE","m_img":1,"country_name":"Sweden"},{"no":121339267,"now":"04\/16\/17(Sun)05:05:32","name":"Anonymous","com":"You can pray for me.

While fasting before Easter seems to have been ancient and widespread, the length of that fast varied significantly from place to place and across generations. In the latter half of the second century, for instance, Irenaeus of Lyons (in Gaul) and Tertullian (in North Africa) tell us that the preparatory fast lasted one or two days, or forty hours\u2014commemorating what was believed to be the exact duration of Christ\u2019s time in the tomb. By the mid-third century, Dionysius of Alexandria speaks of a fast of up to six days practiced by the devout in his see; and the Byzantine historian Socrates relates that the Christians of Rome at some point kept a fast of three weeks.2 Only following the Council of Nicea in 325 a.d. did the length of Lent become fixed at forty days, and then only nomi-<br>nally. Accordingly, it was assumed that the forty-day Lent that we encoun- ter almost everywhere by the mid-fourth century must have been the result of a gradual lengthening of the pre-Easter fast by adding days and weeks to the original one- or two-day observance.3 This lengthening, in turn, was thought necessary to make up for the waning zeal of the post-apostolic church and to provide a longer period of instruction for the increasing num- bers of former pagans thronging to the font for Easter baptism. Such remained the standard theory for most of the twentieth century.","time":1492334263,"resto":121337830,"id":"TgafUU91","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":121340209,"now":"04\/16\/17(Sun)05:18:32","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121340091\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121340091<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/LGBT<wbr>_rights_by_country_or_territory<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Killing people because of their sexual orientation in the 21st century<\/span><br>fucking muslims mate","time":1492334312,"resto":121337830,"id":"OCKcZGTx","country":"HR","country_name":"Croatia"},{"no":121340228,"now":"04\/16\/17(Sun)05:18:43","name":"Anonymous","com":"Christ is risen!","time":1492334323,"resto":121337830,"id":"jepnk7UQ","country":"RS","country_name":"Serbia"},{"no":121340390,"now":"04\/16\/17(Sun)05:21:13","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121340091\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121340091<\/a><br>You should be the last to speak, Mehmet.

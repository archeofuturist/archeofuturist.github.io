Eric Holder was not the first AG to be held in contempt of Congress over the matter. Barack Obama never declared documents about Fast and Furious desired by Congress to be covered by executive privilege. Brian Terry and Jaime Zapata were two unlucky agents killed by random criminals with who knows what. <br><br>Hillary Clinton having a private email server to conduct official business with was not illegal. She did not delete 33,000 emails after Congress subpoenaed them. There was no classified information on her server. The FBI took control of the server and examined it forensically and found nothing wrong. <br><br>Bill Clinton and Loretta Lynch just talked about grandchildren in a meeting in Clinton&#039;s airplane on the tarmac in Phoenix, AZ. They do that all the time. The tarmac is a great place to catch up with friends. <br><br>Jack Ryan&#039;s divorce records were mistakenly released during Barack Obama&#039;s race for senate against him. It was unavoidable and unfortunate. <br><br>Obama, Clinton, and their administration had no pattern whatsoever in abusing their power or utilizing the organs of government to stymie or ruin political opponents. To think so is paranoia, ignorance, and just plain red state stupidity. <br><br>It&#039;s 2017 people.

These heinous actions by the Bashar al-Assad regime are a consequence of the past administration&#039;s weakness and irresolution. President Obama said in 2012 that he would establish a &#039;red line&#039; against the use of chemical weapons and then did nothing. The United States stands with our allies across the globe to condemn this intolerable attack.&quot; - Trump<\/span><br><br>Assad and Russians BTFO!<br><br>How long until Syria is invaded by the USA?<br><br>Source:http:\/\/www.npr.org\/sections\/<wbr>thetwo-way\/2017\/04\/04\/522570250\/58-<wbr>die-in-attack-on-syrian-town-where-<wbr>toxic-gas-and-shelling-were-reporte<wbr>d?utm_source=facebook.com&amp;utm_mediu<wbr>m=social&amp;utm_campaign=npr&amp;utm_term=<wbr>nprnews&amp;utm_content=20170404","filename":"donald_trump_flag","ext":".jpg","w":620,"h":412,"tn_w":249,"tn_h":166,"tim":1491344753786,"time":1491344753,"md5":"aDZT7xdgltRT+g3xoZ01QQ==","fsize":270059,"resto":0,"id":"6XF6tKQ8","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"todays-chemical-attack-in-syria-against-innocent","country_name":"United States","replies":10,"images":3,"unique_ips":7},{"no":119526856,"now":"04\/04\/17(Tue)18:30:39","name":"Anonymous5","com":"<a href=\"#p119526243\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119526243<\/a><br><br>This Chemical attack was done by &quot;Moderate Rebels&quot;(Terror groups) once again. <br><br>Don&#039;t fall for the MSM narrative spinning..<br><br>http:\/\/archive.4plebs.org\/pol\/searc<wbr>h\/subject\/knowledge%20bomb\/username<wbr>\/anonymous5\/tripcode\/%21%219O2tecpD<wbr>HQ6","filename":"Pyramidz","ext":".jpg","w":1000,"h":667,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":83,"tim":1491345039808,"time":1491345039,"md5":"VJfTrDSEn1je8f7y\/rdkig==","fsize":162883,"resto":119526243,"id":"CLzTHydE","country":"US","trip":"!!9O2tecpDHQ6","country_name":"United States"},{"no":119526997,"now":"04\/04\/17(Tue)18:31:58","name":"Anonymous","com":"what&#039;s trump gonna do?<br>get another seal killed?","filename":"REPORTERS-LAUGHING","ext":".jpg","w":570,"h":238,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":52,"tim":1491345118367,"time":1491345118,"md5":"mWATGuBmVb2+Ipqo2ok4\/w==","fsize":17946,"resto":119526243,"id":"ZP77mj2g","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":119527559,"now":"04\/04\/17(Tue)18:36:32","name":"Anonymous","com":"Oh look Trump is cucking for the Neocons again<br><br>What a surprise","time":1491345392,"resto":119526243,"id":"eLMW7qfa","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":119527682,"now":"04\/04\/17(Tue)18:37:36","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119526856\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119526856<\/a><br>There&#039;s not even evidence there was a chemical attack<br><br>There&#039;s been no independent verification of anything","time":1491345456,"resto":119526243,"id":"eLMW7qfa","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":119527802,"now":"04\/04\/17(Tue)18:38:40","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119526997\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119526997<\/a><br>I like how leftists whine and piss themselves over a marine dying but say nothing when Obama supported the Saudis invading Yemen in the first place","time":1491345520,"resto":119526243,"id":"eLMW7qfa","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":119527978,"now":"04\/04\/17(Tue)18:40:08","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119526856\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119526856<\/a><br>Fuck off LARPer.","time":1491345608,"resto":119526243,"id":"KQNp7l1p","country":"BE","country_name":"Belgium"},{"no":119528076,"now":"04\/04\/17(Tue)18:40:46","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119526243\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119526243<\/a><br>Would you say Assad crossed... a red line?","filename":"alan-alda-as-hawkeye","ext":".jpg","w":450,"h":338,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":93,"tim":1491345646126,"time":1491345646,"md5":"AEz6TiEql6gR7GmWUTSoAw==","fsize":33086,"resto":119526243,"id":"JVo2Rdjt","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":119528234,"now":"04\/04\/17(Tue)18:42:11","name":"Anonymous5","com":"<a href=\"#p119527682\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119527682<\/a><br><br>Even more of a reason to start questioning it wouldn&#039;t you say?","time":1491345731,"resto":119526243,"id":"CLzTHydE","country":"US","trip":"!!9O2tecpDHQ6","country_name":"United States"},{"no":119528241,"now":"04\/04\/17(Tue)18:42:16","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119526856\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119526856<\/a><br>You&#039;re really obsessed w\/ this persona you&#039;ve created, eh?","time":1491345736,"resto":119526243,"id":"JVo2Rdjt","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":119528265,"now":"04\/04\/17(Tue)18:42:28","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119526243\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119526243<\/a><br>He&#039;s saying that so the media wouldn&#039;t go apeshit on him.<br><br>He&#039;s said in the past that Assad&#039;s a brave and true leader.","time":1491345748,"resto":119526243,"id":"tJdOM8x+","country":"US","country_name":"United States"}]}

I do good things for others not because I&#039;m told to by a government bureau, not because I&#039;m a sefless Deity figure either spreading goodness (even though I do take some lessons from religion such as Christianity, another thing that would be hunted down in Communist states), I do it because doing good things for others makes people happy, it makes them like me and treasure my company, and in turn, that makes me happy. All virtue is built on that fact. Doing good for others generally does good for you. No amount of force from a higher authority figure can bully that into you. It&#039;s something people must develop on their own and enjoy, otherwise you resent having to forcibly share your things with others, which is one of the many paradoxes in Communism. Force leads to resentment. Forcibly sharing time, effort and goods for others makes you less motivated, less happy, and overall less fulfilled in life.<br><br>The same applies to economics of course.

Just like a religion has an origin of the world story that fits neatly into what it&#039;s going to tell later, Marxism has nonsense like &quot;primitive socialism&quot; and &quot;dialectical materialism&quot;, which are pseudo-scientific garbage that make sweeping statements about the nature of the world without anything to back it up. Primitive socialism, for instance, states that before the dawn of civilization all people shared everything equally. Which is nonsense. Beginning to sound like the garden of Eden yet?<br><br>Then you have the holy book, which is Marx&#039;s work. And just like with religion, everything flows from here. It&#039;s even named after the founder, just like Christianity, Buddhism, Muhammedanism. Consequently, all other works are only reflections on this, written according the rule system laid out. Any outside reflection is signed away as work of the enemy.<br><br>Which brings us to you next point: Marxism does not function without an enemy. Marxism is always a struggle (a jihad, if you will) to overcome outside forces, unlike literally every other political ideology out there. Marxist arguments begin and end with fighting capitalism, and even when it&#039;s in power, Marxism paints itself as the underdog. Winning is impossible, because the struggle defines the entire movement.<br><br>It is also totalitarian. Religions are quite clear on adherance to doctrine being paramount, even in private, and typically try to police this. So does Marxism.<br><br>Marxism also promises a far-off catharsis, an end to current existence, where it is victorious, everyone falls under its fold, and this magically does away with all the ills of the world, functionally identical to concepts like Dar es Salaam. And, of course, despite this inevitablity and the flawlesness of the doctrine, infidels must be punished!<br><br>You can&#039;t have a debate because their belief is not rational.

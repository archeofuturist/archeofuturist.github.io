I do good things for others not because I&#039;m told to by a government bureau, not because I&#039;m a sefless Deity figure either spreading goodness (even though I do take some lessons from religion such as Christianity, another thing that would be hunted down in Communist states), I do it because doing good things for others makes people happy, it makes them like me and treasure my company, and in turn, that makes me happy. All virtue is built on that fact. Doing good for others generally does good for you. No amount of force from a higher authority figure can bully that into you. It&#039;s something people must develop on their own and enjoy, otherwise you resent having to forcibly share your things with others, which is one of the many paradoxes in Communism. Force leads to resentment. Forcibly sharing time, effort and goods for others makes you less motivated, less happy, and overall less fulfilled in life.<br><br>The same applies to economics of course.

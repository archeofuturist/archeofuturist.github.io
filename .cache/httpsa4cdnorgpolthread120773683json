And on Funnyjunk they would be distracted by other better posts that my uploads are barely noticed at all. You guys seem to know how to dig through trash real well that on FJ people call it weaponized autism. I mean you guys are like the cool uncle that the parents dont like because your a bad influence. <br><br>Ive tried reddit before but ugh its a shitshow were most posts get buried under other posts plus the mods supposedly delete reposts as well.

Just be aware that the effect takes a little while to come on and is relatively subtle. I was dumb and took way too much one night in an effort to get high and got real sick. I was basically vomiting for an hour, during which the nausea would come on out of nowhere and go 0-100 in about 3 seconds with no warning ever 5 minutes or so. Other negative effects for me included it fucking my sleep schedule up and giving night sweats. <br><br>Other than that, it&#039;s not a terrible substance when used in extreme moderation.

The idea was to have a drug that they would take in emergencies. The drug would be of very rapid absorption and would drastically reduce stress while causing no drowsyness that could possibly cause the pilots to commit errors. The point was for it to help the astronauts to take the correct decisions. When you&#039;re riding a several hundred million dollar spacecraft there must be no room for wrong decisions.<br><br>As a downside, it&#039;s too powerful to be use for any civilian use and it&#039;s really addictive. If you want it for concentration there are countless other very effective nootropics with absolutely no downsides such as DMAE and if you wanted for the anti-stress effect there are other drugs like Kratom and others as such.<br><br>It&#039;s very pointless to buy unless you are really going to get into really high-stress situations like your first months learnng game or for military purposes.<br><br>If you ever found or joined a militia or any other combat organization those would come really handy.

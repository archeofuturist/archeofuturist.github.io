Far too many Westerners are still licking old (now gangrenous) wounds from eons ago. Europeans and white people are deemed inherently or inveterately evil because of colonialism and racism, and so deserve to be punished, no matter how the global situation has changed since colonial days.

Unscrupulous Islamic supremacist warriors play the victimhood ploy with proficiency. They would have us all turn a blind eye to the history of Islamic jihad conquest prior to the era of colonialism, as well as to present-day slavery in some Muslim countries, the general Islamic intolerance and abuse of religious minorities and infidels, and the sickening treatment of women that is sanctioned by Sharia law.<br><br>Le Pen also said:<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Mass immigration is not an opportunity for France, it\u2019s a tragedy for France\u2026Give us France back, for God\u2019s sake.<\/span><br><br>https:\/\/www.jihadwatch.org\/2017\/04\/<wbr>marine-le-pen-give-us-france-back-f<wbr>or-gods-sake","filename":"Screenshot_2017-04-18_21-45-08","ext":".png","w":346,"h":542,"tn_w":159,"tn_h":250,"tim":1492570166586,"time":1492570166,"md5":"R\/SkI3Lw0LIgCniiGw\/dHA==","fsize":116539,"resto":0,"id":"RRIL4ojG","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"marine-le-pen-give-us-france-back-for-gods-sake","country_name":"United States","replies":0,"images":0,"unique_ips":1}]}

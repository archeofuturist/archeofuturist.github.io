Accelerationism doesn&#039;t work for Germoney because your population is old and your right wing pathetically infertile. In America however there is a demonstrable difference between right-wing whites and left-wing whites in terms of childbearing. Without Trump with the Obama-era level of immigration the USA would still be around 50%~ non-Hispanic white in 2060 because the white population will enter a period of rapid growth sometime after 2035.<br><br>Youth is what is necessary to fight a race war, and is usually what sparks a race war when large numbers of young men feel threatened. Balkanization by the late 21st century would be the reality in America if not for Trump.<br><br>Additionally the USA would not become mestizo, mestizo implies halfbreed implies large scale intermarriage between whites and Indios. White Hispanics are 1 of 2 Hispanics. Less than 10% of white Hispanics have children with a Hispanic who is not white, compared to more than 30% of white Hispanics who have children with a non-Hispanic white. Hispanics who are white do not mix with those who are non-white despite both being Spanish-speaking. The rate of intermarriage is even lower for non-Hispanic whites.<br><br>The current path for the USA is that by the end of the century whites will again be above 85% white. Additionally non-Hispanic whites will be around 70% of the population by midcentury after the conservative baby boom gets into full swing. Whites overall will be in a much stronger position because of Trump.","time":1491673036,"resto":120155945,"id":"AJSfk8e5","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":120157654,"now":"04\/08\/17(Sat)13:37:19","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120157494\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120157494<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;&quot;we don&#039;t have the leadership&quot;<\/span><br><br>Now we do faggot","filename":"1474139211840","ext":".png","w":736,"h":951,"tn_w":96,"tn_h":124,"tim":1491673039323,"time":1491673039,"md5":"G1fZ2AiyCh6rqMYon9CLsQ==","fsize":404115,"resto":120155945,"id":"fgovH\/+6","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":120157669,"now":"04\/08\/17(Sat)13:37:25","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120157114\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120157114<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;online poll<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;informative<\/span><br>All of his big supporters are either bailing or are being especially critical of this action.

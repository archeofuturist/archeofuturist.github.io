It is not the French politicians who are solely to blame for letting in hordes of migrants into the country, it is the EU with its Common Asylum Policy who forced them to do so. You have a very modest GDP growth partially because the euro doesn&#039;t fit your economy and you lost the ability to control your interest rate. The EU gives subsidies to foreign agricultural firms at the expense of your taxpayers that at the end of the day, harms French farmers. The EU being a protectionist block doesn&#039;t allow you make your own trade deals. The French people have to abide by the laws put forward by the unelected Europen Commission and there&#039;s no mechanism to repeal a law which they don&#039;t like.<br>I can go on and on, but why don&#039;t you put it all into a bunch of beautiful infographics and thereby tell the voters about the threats the Soviet European Union poses to their future?<br>Even if Le Pen don&#039;t win this time around, we need to make a case against this atrocious system suffocating Europe, because debates on EU will come up again and again with every power-grab, every failure the bureaucrats in Brussels make.","filename":"o-o-this-is-fine-rip-france-if-marine-le-10658225","ext":".png","w":500,"h":735,"tn_w":170,"tn_h":250,"tim":1493225371447,"time":1493225371,"md5":"LiBhBEP6EEUTzHSClPjAjQ==","fsize":79198,"resto":0,"id":"VLQDB4sh","country":"RU","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"french-election-discussion","country_name":"Russian Federation","replies":7,"images":0,"unique_ips":3},{"no":122906036,"now":"04\/26\/17(Wed)12:56:23","name":"Anonymous","com":"French people don&#039;t want to leave the EU.

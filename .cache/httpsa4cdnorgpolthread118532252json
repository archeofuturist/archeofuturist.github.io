I&#039;ve read a lot of stuff about Walt and the Disney corporation being associated with Freemasonry, the Illuminati, CIA mind control\/MKUltra, even theories associating them with Moloch worship and the infamous alleged pedophile rings of Alex Jones\/pizzagate fame...<br><br>I should mention I myself am a Christian occultist, so I don&#039;t consider everything associated with Occult spiritual paths to be &quot;evil&quot;\/Occult. But on the other hand, some of them clearly are. At least on the surface, the messages within Disney films, theme parks, etc. seems to be pro-magick but always demonstrates white magic triumphing over dark. Yet you can&#039;t deny the creepy dystopian fascistic vibes that lurk around the edges of a place like Disneyland...<br><br>I have a lot more thoughts to contribute, this whole things is such a twisted labryinth for me. But first I just want to know if anyone is privy to some insider info about the Disney corporation or Walt himself that might shed a little light here.","filename":"disneymason","ext":".png","w":500,"h":244,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":122,"tim":1490633984704,"time":1490633984,"md5":"i6NeX5QH\/tacpDx3B\/JUww==","fsize":141089,"resto":0,"id":"mPmOr44P","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"anyone-here-want-to-redpill-me-on-disney-ive-read","country_name":"United States","replies":6,"images":1,"unique_ips":3},{"no":118532449,"now":"03\/27\/17(Mon)13:01:47","name":"Anonymous","com":"Christian occultist ?

As someone who respects the beautiful truths that can be found in the Occult, yet is also suspicious that there might be an Occult conspiracy behind globalization, I&#039;m not sure which side to fall on.<br><br>I will say, I&#039;ve read through a lot of the material you mentioned, and I think a lot of the hidden &quot;sex imagery&quot; stuff (the penis tower on The Little Mermaid box, &quot;sex&quot; in the sky in Lion King, etc.) really say more about the people finding such things than any &quot;evil intent&quot; on the creator&#039;s part. Firstly, the sexual imagery is always so subtle or blink-and-you-miss-it, I honestly don&#039;t believe any of the stuff they point to would have any effect on the viewer, not in a psychological or Occult sense. And also, I think it betrays the (IMO) naive worldview that sees any subtle intimation of sex organs or sexuality to be proof of &quot;evil intent&quot;, as though human sexuality is inherently evil or mind-corroding. I don&#039;t believe that to be the case... If anyone has some strong evidence for subliminal messaging relating to perverse or pedophilic sexuality in Disney, I&#039;d like to b proved wrong, I just haven&#039;t seen it yet.<br><br>I think the sex stuff is mostly silly fluff that distracts from the real issues at hand, like the various pentagrams and Eyes of Horus I&#039;ve found hidden in plain sight around the Disney World resort, or the fact that one of the wealthiest most successful corporations in the world has built their brand around the concept of &quot;magic&quot;.","filename":"donaldpentagram","ext":".jpg","w":620,"h":400,"tn_w":124,"tn_h":80,"tim":1490635705750,"time":1490635705,"md5":"XGrFBAvrK8JDAij1PhyUgA==","fsize":44143,"resto":118532252,"id":"mPmOr44P","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":118536676,"now":"03\/27\/17(Mon)13:42:23","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118532889\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118532889<\/a><br>Interesting, into paganism too but i&#039;m also interested in lucifer","time":1490636543,"resto":118532252,"id":"fGj7On3J","country":"FR","country_name":"France"}]}

But on the other hand, some of them clearly are. At least on the surface, the messages within Disney films, theme parks, etc. seems to be pro-magick but always demonstrates white magic triumphing over dark. Yet you can&#039;t deny the creepy dystopian fascistic vibes that lurk around the edges of a place like Disneyland...<br><br>I have a lot more thoughts to contribute, this whole things is such a twisted labryinth for me.

Firstly, the sexual imagery is always so subtle or blink-and-you-miss-it, I honestly don&#039;t believe any of the stuff they point to would have any effect on the viewer, not in a psychological or Occult sense. And also, I think it betrays the (IMO) naive worldview that sees any subtle intimation of sex organs or sexuality to be proof of &quot;evil intent&quot;, as though human sexuality is inherently evil or mind-corroding. I don&#039;t believe that to be the case... If anyone has some strong evidence for subliminal messaging relating to perverse or pedophilic sexuality in Disney, I&#039;d like to b proved wrong, I just haven&#039;t seen it yet.<br><br>I think the sex stuff is mostly silly fluff that distracts from the real issues at hand, like the various pentagrams and Eyes of Horus I&#039;ve found hidden in plain sight around the Disney World resort, or the fact that one of the wealthiest most successful corporations in the world has built their brand around the concept of &quot;magic&quot;.","filename":"donaldpentagram","ext":".jpg","w":620,"h":400,"tn_w":124,"tn_h":80,"tim":1490635705750,"time":1490635705,"md5":"XGrFBAvrK8JDAij1PhyUgA==","fsize":44143,"resto":118532252,"id":"mPmOr44P","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":118536676,"now":"03\/27\/17(Mon)13:42:23","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118532889\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118532889<\/a><br>Interesting, into paganism too but i&#039;m also interested in lucifer","time":1490636543,"resto":118532252,"id":"fGj7On3J","country":"FR","country_name":"France"},{"no":118537785,"now":"03\/27\/17(Mon)13:52:31","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118536676\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118536676<\/a><br>Lucifer is an interesting case. Most people associate the name with Satan, the ultimate transgressive or egoic force which opposes the true God (Zoroaster called it Ahriman, the Egyptians used Set, people use the name Moloch, etc.) If there is an Occult conspiracy among the elites, I believe it is that egoic power-hungry force which they worship.<br><br>Yet the name Lucifer means &quot;light-bringer&quot;, a title that Jesus himself uses to describe his own mission. People also associate the Isaiah text mentioning Lucifer with the Hebrew word for the Morning Star, meaning Venus, who is generally a benefic planet not a malefic one. (Malefic planets are usually seen to be Saturn, Mars, and to a lesser extent Mercury.) In the non-Satan context, I see him as a Prometheus figure, who brought wisdom and technology to humanity and was punished by the gods for it by being pinned to a mountainside for all eternity.

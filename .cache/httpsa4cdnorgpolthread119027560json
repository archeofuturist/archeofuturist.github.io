The professor also reportedly claimed that Jesus\u2019s disciples did not believe that he was God.\u201d<br><br>\u201cA few classes later, Polston claimed that the professor engaged in a discussion with a Muslim student who argued that gays and adulterers should be beheaded under Sharia law.\u201d<br><br>\u201cI spoke out to the professor about the grade and subsequently the decapitation comments made by the student,\u201d Polston told The College Fix. \u201cThe statement by the conservative Muslim student met such fear by some that one of the students reported it to the FBI. Later, I was reported by the professor to the dean of campus safety. The situation was surreal.

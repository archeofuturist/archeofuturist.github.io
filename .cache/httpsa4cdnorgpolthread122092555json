There is no competing with guys willing to put 100 hours a week into a programming job when they also took the job for tens of thousands less than white candidates. Honestly, Indian developers don&#039;t ask for more money in interviews, they say they will work for anything over X and name their minimum, and it&#039;s like $45,000 in industries where the norm is $80,000.<br><br>Jesus God, as a white programmer sitting in on interviews with that, fuck no.

One of my fellow labrat contractors was an Indian with a PhD in Chemistry. Fucker couldn&#039;t calculate molarity or molality of solutions, had no clue that glassware needed to be cleaned, or how to do it. I asked to be assigned to another part of the lab so I didn&#039;t have to cover for him. The lab director wasn&#039;t going to do it, until I pointed out that the reason I was interning there was to learn from experienced research scientists, and that I wasn&#039;t learning anything from poojay ... in fact, I was tutoring him. Simple test&quot; make up a 2 molar solution of HCl for a simple titration. Mine was perfect down to part per million, poojay Did Something, but nobody could figure out what he did. His titration was off by a factor of ten plus. He must have been calculating in Sanskrit moles.<br><br>Indian PhD, BTFO by American 3rd year university student in an American State university (a shitty little one, at that.<br><br>I have other such stories, but that one stands out because it was my first (dare I say it?) redpill on poojeets.

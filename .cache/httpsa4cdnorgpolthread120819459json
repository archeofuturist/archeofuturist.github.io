Potter must destroy the objects and then kill Vold. Burn korans i guess its telling us. Vold killed baby harry potter (hence the scar on his face) because of some prophecy that Harry would kill him one day. It failed cos Harry&#039;s mum died while screaming don&#039;t kill my baby, and her love &quot;sacrifice&quot; somehow saved harry from everything ever and made Vold into a wisp that floated off to Albania (I&#039;m not joking), LOVE, a magic more powerful than even dumblerdon or voldemort can know, saves everything always. Never ever let hate grip you. Holding the Vold Soul objects makes people amgry and hate. Some Vold soul went into Harry too so he dies and comes back or something at the end and gets to see Vold&#039;s actual soul in the afterlife which is a grotesque baby.

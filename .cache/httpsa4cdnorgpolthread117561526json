And what&#039;s up with these new rallies--is this really the best use of his time? Feels like Reagan cloistered in a dark room watching his old movies while GHWB ran the country.","filename":"meetsarabs","ext":".jpg","w":1024,"h":768,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":187,"tim":1490057387975,"time":1490057387,"md5":"jtWx9yHTHMNxKx2g0nc3aQ==","fsize":132062,"resto":0,"id":"PmzJYhtp","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"anyone-else-feel-like-donald-has-been-getting","country_name":"United States","replies":4,"images":2,"unique_ips":3},{"no":117561835,"now":"03\/20\/17(Mon)20:52:05","name":"Anonymous","com":"<span class=\"quote\">&gt;new rallies<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;also cloistered in a dark room at the same time<\/span>","filename":"IMG_7099","ext":".png","w":915,"h":732,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":100,"tim":1490057525333,"time":1490057525,"md5":"z50rp6BT\/5kw\/LmyrLdauw==","fsize":263754,"resto":117561526,"id":"\/eRyJUXV","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":117561895,"now":"03\/20\/17(Mon)20:52:35","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p117561835\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;117561835<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;doesn&#039;t understand metaphor<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;autist confirmed<\/span>","time":1490057555,"resto":117561526,"id":"PmzJYhtp","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":117562357,"now":"03\/20\/17(Mon)20:56:07","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p117561895\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;117561895<\/a><br>You mean Reagan was not literally cloistered in a dark room watching old movies?

Donald Trump is super rich compared to the average person. Compared to the types of people who command armies and own central banks and state oil companies, he&#039;s a nobody. He was hired to be a steam valve by vested interests and that&#039;s the part he played in the campaign and now he&#039;s just rolling over in office.","time":1490058010,"resto":117561526,"id":"PL36Vvp4","country":"US","country_name":"United States"}]}

They&#039;ve been conditioned to see it as just a way to feel good, and let people in when they feel the need or longing for a sexual experience. This hookup social media, friends with benefits society has solidified that. Which is why many white women have no problems taking BBC or becoming a roastie. They want to enjoy their younger years fucking literally as many men as they want so they can settle down in their 30s and start a family. Many girls say it&#039;s normal to go through a &quot;jungle fever&quot; phase. Girls don&#039;t have morals anymore, and of course chads will not be bothered by fucking as many of them as they can. Girls allow this now, so everything is spiraling out of control. To feel normal you have to be a total slut to fit in. Highschool kids are fucking like crazy these days. There are no morals, no values, little proper parenting, and lots of push in our culture to just have sex with whoever. One night stands are fine! No commitment! Open relationships! It&#039;s disgusting really. Imagining how many times your GF has been filled with another man&#039;s semen. This used to be appalling, but now it&#039;s perfectly acceptable. Men are required to have sexual experience for the majority of females most dating sites. Can we fix it?

It is possible (even likely) to have profound introspective insights, advancing your thought processes in 10-12 hours, what otherwise would take years of experience, and\/or psychotherapy. It is also a double-edged sword in that respect. It can awaken latent psychosis\/schizophrenia. I don&#039;t recommend taking it when one is in an emotionally or psychologically vulnerable state. <br><br>One of the ways I describe some of it&#039;s effects is that it allows you to adjust the lens you view the world with. You can zoom in and see the world with a microscope. Eg. You are barefoot on your front lawn, and you are acutely aware of how your feet feel on the soft living grass. You feel the soft, moist soil under the grass. You began to look at the grass and keep noticing more details. There is a little clover mixed in. Now you are on your knees with your face 1 foot from the ground looking at a tiny little ant moving towards it&#039;s tinly little hill, where there are 100 more ants. You realize there is also a mole hole. Then you begin to contemplate the whole tiny ecosystem down under your toes. These thoughts will fluidly pass through your brain quickly. It can be overwhelming. Some people will turn into vegetarians at this point. That is one way it can go. Then sometimes you end up looking at the world through a telescope. You may begin to notice the tall trees around you and how they resemble pictures you&#039;ve seen of nerve endings. You start to think about how lighting often strikes the treetops and how that resembles the charge passing across a synapse in your brain. You begin to think that our solar system resembles the composition of an atom with nuclei, protons, electrons, etc.. As night falls you become fixed on the stars contemplating life outside of earth. This is where people can end up on God\/Alien trips. <br>All in all, I think LSD is a wonderful chemical that can deprogram yrs of brainwashing in a matter of hours.","time":1493575742,"resto":123499922,"id":"9eoBYpM9","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":123505061,"now":"04\/30\/17(Sun)14:09:18","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123499922\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123499922<\/a><br>Drugs are the ultimate blue pill.","time":1493575758,"resto":123499922,"id":"o+fxHZpQ","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":123505371,"now":"04\/30\/17(Sun)14:12:17","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123500065\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123500065<\/a><br>Backing this up. 99.9% of it is complete bull.<br><a href=\"#p123502572\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123502572<\/a><br>DMT is over waaaayyy too quickly to gain any real meaningful insight, and the few things you do learn come to months, maybe years later.

LSD will usually your vision doing funny things with light, often making things look like they are breathing, but your brain is just slightly changing how you see light and dark\/shadows, sort of focusing back and forth like a see saw. Stucco ceilings are awesome!

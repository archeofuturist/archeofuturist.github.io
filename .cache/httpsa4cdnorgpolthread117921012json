Generally, they didn&#039;t have as many friends in the Islamic community or a connection with Islam, and Their weird thought process goes something like this:<br>&quot;How can Islam be true if it allows eating meat?&quot;<br>&quot;How can a real Prophet eat meat?&quot;<br>&quot;Islam was made by Mohammed so that he can eat meat&quot;<br>&quot;The Quran says that you can eat cattle and you have a whole holiday about eating meat&quot;<br>And other dumb things I find laughable. So they leave Islam, write a book that becomes a bestseller because of the confirmation bias it grants to fellow vegans, and make money and go on air on News shows that don&#039;t really give real news. So that&#039;s how life of an Apostate works.<br>2) The next group of people is the progressives. According to them, Veganism is the right way and Islam&#039;s long term goal was to put an end to meat eating, which literally has no Islamic precedent. According to them, the last 1400 years of Islamic Scholars had it wrong because they had a meat-eating bias, and suddenly THEY come out of nowhere, claiming to know what no one before them did. So these progressives come up with a whole new radical reinterpretation. Also, they Google the word &quot;Ijtihad&quot; and by authority of Sh. Google and Mufti Wikipedia becomes a self-proclaimed Mujtahid (Having no true idea what it really means)<br>&quot;The Quran stops you from eating as much meat as possible. Look at all the meat banned. Pork is banned etc, and the rest of eating meat is limited&quot;<br>&quot;I&#039;m gonna reject most of these Hadiths because they come 300 years later. However, there are 1 or 2 Hadiths that agree with me, so I&#039;ll take them as authentic. And one of them says that The Prophet went months without cooking a fire.

The thing I like about Islam the most is that the Quran is very well preserved. I think the hardest stuff for me to come to terms with is the Passion of Christ. The evidence Islam cites for Jesus not being crucified is a gospel that was carbon dated to ~200 years after it.","time":1490280279,"resto":117921012,"id":"4U4Uszmz","country":"US","country_name":"United States"}]}

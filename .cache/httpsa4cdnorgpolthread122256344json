In 1944, CIA\u2019s precursor, the Office of Strategic Services (OSS), created the Simple Sabotage Field Manual.<\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;This classified booklet described ways to sabotage the US\u2019 World War II enemies. The OSS Director William J. Donovan recommended that the sabotage guidance be declassified and distributed to citizens of enemy states via pamphlets and targeted broadcasts.<\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Many of the sabotage instructions guide ordinary citizens, who may not have agree with their country\u2019s wartime policies towards the US, to destabilize their governments by taking disruptive actions. Some of the instructions seem outdated; others remain surprisingly relevant. Together they are a reminder of how easily productivity and order can be undermined.<\/span><br><br>https:\/\/www.cia.gov\/news-informatio<wbr>n\/featured-story-archive\/2012-featu<wbr>red-story-archive\/simple-sabotage.h<wbr>tml<br><br>https:\/\/www.cia.gov\/news-informatio<wbr>n\/featured-story-archive\/2012-featu<wbr>red-story-archive\/CleanedUOSSSimple<wbr>Sabotage_sm.pdf","filename":"nothingisbeyondourreach","ext":".png","w":500,"h":500,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":250,"tim":1492851265391,"time":1492851265,"md5":"jYiG\/qyMjozQzSL2xU49pg==","fsize":205953,"resto":0,"id":"SQa1jXNg","country":"AU","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"time-to-upgrade-our-weaponized-autism-pol","country_name":"Australia","replies":109,"images":55,"unique_ips":60,"tail_size":50},{"no":122256523,"now":"04\/22\/17(Sat)04:57:15","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122256344\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122256344<\/a><br>http:\/\/www.theblackvault.com\/docume<wbr>ntarchive\/psychological-operations\/<wbr><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;You&#039;ve stumbled upon the largest privately run online repository of declassified government documents anywhere in the world.

Those who manipulate this unseen mechanism of society constitute an invisible government which is the true ruling power of our country.\u201d\u2014Edward Bernays, Propaganda<\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;A seminal and controversial figure in the history of political thought and public relations, Edward Bernays (1891\u20131995), pioneered the scientific technique of shaping and manipulating public opinion, which he famously dubbed \u201cengineering of consent.\u201d During World War I, he was an integral part of the U.S. Committee on Public Information (CPI), a powerful propaganda apparatus that was mobilized to package, advertise and sell the war to the American people as one that would \u201cMake the World Safe for Democracy.\u201d The CPI would become the blueprint in which marketing strategies for future wars would be based upon.<\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Bernays applied the techniques he had learned in the CPI and, incorporating some of the ideas of Walter Lipmann, became an outspoken proponent of propaganda as a tool for democratic and corporate manipulation of the population. His 1928 bombshell Propaganda lays out his eerily prescient vision for using propaganda to regiment the collective mind in a variety of areas, including government, politics, art, science and education. To read this book today is to frightfully comprehend what our contemporary institutions of government and business have become in regards to organized manipulation of the masses.<\/span><br><br>https:\/\/www.voltairenet.org\/IMG\/pdf<wbr>\/Bernays_Propaganda_in_english_.pdf<wbr><br>https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Edwar<wbr>d_Bernays","filename":"jonesinauguration","ext":".webm","w":1280,"h":720,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":70,"tim":1492856515242,"time":1492856515,"md5":"zH5HMwwFCKp2aeTTuSw2XQ==","fsize":2628571,"resto":122256344,"id":"SQa1jXNg","country":"AU","country_name":"Australia"},{"no":122262120,"now":"04\/22\/17(Sat)06:22:41","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122261863\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122261863<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;spherecucks<\/span>","filename":"o-tinfoil-hat-facebook","ext":".jpg","w":450,"h":450,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":125,"tim":1492856561000,"time":1492856561,"md5":"ToZ+sjgeWv7LN8CDjW\/Cuw==","fsize":40584,"resto":122256344,"id":"IGIvRGS+","country":"AU","country_name":"Australia"},{"no":122262131,"now":"04\/22\/17(Sat)06:22:52","name":"Anonymous","com":"Also made a few phone wallpapers for the most autistic of you lads.","filename":"Kekistan_phone_box","ext":".png","w":2160,"h":3840,"tn_w":70,"tn_h":125,"tim":1492856572290,"time":1492856572,"md5":"zb\/kHmDg4ms2Yiwpjjfk6w==","fsize":326030,"resto":122256344,"id":"ml5mr942","country":"FR","country_name":"France"},{"no":122262157,"now":"04\/22\/17(Sat)06:23:11","name":"Anonymous","filename":"Kekistan_phone_E_Horizontal","ext":".png","w":2160,"h":3840,"tn_w":70,"tn_h":125,"tim":1492856591263,"time":1492856591,"md5":"CowC0Domq9XkeBIcwdAigg==","fsize":333095,"resto":122256344,"id":"ml5mr942","country":"FR","country_name":"France"},{"no":122262160,"now":"04\/22\/17(Sat)06:23:13","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122257954\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122257954<\/a><br>can we please stop the &#039;cringey as fuck&#039; meme please.

In 1944, CIA\u2019s precursor, the Office of Strategic Services (OSS), created the Simple Sabotage Field Manual.<\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;This classified booklet described ways to sabotage the US\u2019 World War II enemies. The OSS Director William J. Donovan recommended that the sabotage guidance be declassified and distributed to citizens of enemy states via pamphlets and targeted broadcasts.<\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Many of the sabotage instructions guide ordinary citizens, who may not have agree with their country\u2019s wartime policies towards the US, to destabilize their governments by taking disruptive actions. Some of the instructions seem outdated; others remain surprisingly relevant. Together they are a reminder of how easily productivity and order can be undermined.<\/span><br><br>https:\/\/www.cia.gov\/news-informatio<wbr>n\/featured-story-archive\/2012-featu<wbr>red-story-archive\/simple-sabotage.h<wbr>tml<br><br>https:\/\/www.cia.gov\/news-informatio<wbr>n\/featured-story-archive\/2012-featu<wbr>red-story-archive\/CleanedUOSSSimple<wbr>Sabotage_sm.pdf","filename":"nothingisbeyondourreach","ext":".png","w":500,"h":500,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":250,"tim":1492851265391,"time":1492851265,"md5":"jYiG\/qyMjozQzSL2xU49pg==","fsize":205953,"resto":0,"id":"SQa1jXNg","country":"AU","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"time-to-upgrade-our-weaponized-autism-pol","country_name":"Australia","replies":1,"images":1,"unique_ips":1},{"no":122256523,"now":"04\/22\/17(Sat)04:57:15","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122256344\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122256344<\/a><br>http:\/\/www.theblackvault.com\/docume<wbr>ntarchive\/psychological-operations\/<wbr><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;You&#039;ve stumbled upon the largest privately run online repository of declassified government documents anywhere in the world.

Begun in 1996, at the age of 15, John Greenewald, Jr., began hammering the U.S. Government with FOIA requests to obtain information. The Black Vault is the result of that near 2 decade effort.<\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Psychological Operations (PSYOP, PSYOPS) are techniques used by military and police forces to influence a target audience\u2019s value systems, belief systems, emotions, motives, reasoning, and behavior. Target audiences can be governments, organizations, groups, and individuals, and are used in order to induce confessions, or reinforce attitudes and behaviors favorable to the originator\u2019s objectives. These are sometimes combined with black operations or false flag tactics.<\/span><br><br>Familiarize yourself with these documents back to front, if you&#039;re a regular poster in these kinds of threads, save this comment and copypasta regularly.

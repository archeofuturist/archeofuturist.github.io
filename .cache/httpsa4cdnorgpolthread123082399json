In Hitler&#039;s table talk I see a lot of discussions on how he thinks Christianity was bad and gave birth to Bolshevism, yet it was obvious Bolshevism hated Christianity. Did his views change over time and he just talked out his ass in the early days?He also hated Atheism too so I don&#039;t know what he was about. He had disdain for Islam too but respected both.","filename":"1454023469613","ext":".png","w":419,"h":599,"tn_w":174,"tn_h":250,"tim":1493324762196,"time":1493324762,"md5":"83Xqk8bc4rlKrb5U6U4C0Q==","fsize":291014,"resto":0,"id":"oVf9mZKs","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"so-was-hitler-a-christianor-did-he-just-pander-to","country_name":"United States","replies":0,"images":0,"unique_ips":1}]}

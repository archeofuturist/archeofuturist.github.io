I honestly do not possess a sufficient lexicon to describe the intensity of my hatred for that escutcheon on the face of humanity. <br>I remember when I was a kid, photos of him and John Major came up on the television and I asked &quot;Who are those men?&quot; When I heard they were competing to be the leader of the country, I pointed at John Major and said &quot;I hope he wins.&quot;<br>How fucking right I was. <br>Under &#039;New Labour&#039; we got<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Privatization of the NHS under the PFI scheme<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Selling the gold reserves at market bottom prices in an amateur mistake a 1st year economics student wouldn&#039;t make <\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Opening the doors to unrestricted unskilled migrants in 2004 to deliberately rub the Right&#039;s face in multiculturalism and to import state-dependent voters <\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Creating a revolving door between corporate lobbyists and government <\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Destroying University education<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Scandalous levels of bribery<\/span><br>And that&#039;s just what I remember off the top of my head. <br>Of course, he wasn&#039;t alone. Thanks to the efforts of his spin doctor, Alistair Campbell, &#039;Teflon Tony&#039; was untouchable. In his 1st year as Prime Minister, there was a story about his accepting a bribe in exchange for a Government contract. What should have ended the career of any other politician didn&#039;t even phase him. Oh, and there was Peter Mandelson as well - resigned twice for corruption and rewarded with a peerage for towing the line.","filename":"tony-blair-14","ext":".jpg","w":900,"h":675,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":187,"tim":1493800577177,"time":1493800577,"md5":"AGCF0HCVtkdH+jqI8x8kxA==","fsize":48169,"resto":0,"id":"cRZRaeEK","country":"GB","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"20-years-of-blair","country_name":"United Kingdom","replies":3,"images":0,"unique_ips":2},{"no":123891328,"now":"05\/03\/17(Wed)04:36:45","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123891300\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123891300<\/a><br>And let&#039;s not forget deliberately lying to Parliament about 45 minutes and chemical weapons before taking us to an illegal war in Iraq which left 179 British soldiers and over 500,000 Iraqis dead.

We then have to accept that it is mentally possible to be imutably some combination of these two. There is no reason to believe there is such a thing as being mentally male or female, as &quot;sex&quot; only refers to physical, measurable properties, and there is no definition for male or female mentality based on any objectively, imutably existent state of mind, much less is it measurable. There is neither a reason to believe there is such a thing as being mentally some combination of male and female, as there is no definition for any combination of male and female mentality based on any objectively, imutably existent state of mind, much less is it measurable. Even if it were accepted that these exist, they are still not measurable and thus, people are not qualified to - and have no right to - neither decide what combination of male and female they are mentally, nor demand other people recognize and acknowledge their self-designation. Until such things are actually determined to exist as measurable, imutable, objective states, there is no reason to believe &quot;gender identity&quot; is anything but fantasy.<br><br>Start calling these people by their sex, watch them get mad, and explain that you were merely referring to their &quot;sex identity.&quot; If they protest, ask them why calling them what they are makes them angry.

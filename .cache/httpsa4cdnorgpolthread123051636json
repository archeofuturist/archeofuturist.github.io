We then have to accept that it is mentally possible to be imutably some combination of these two. There is no reason to believe there is such a thing as being mentally male or female, as &quot;sex&quot; only refers to physical, measurable properties, and there is no definition for male or female mentality based on any objectively, imutably existent state of mind, much less is it measurable. There is neither a reason to believe there is such a thing as being mentally some combination of male and female, as there is no definition for any combination of male and female mentality based on any objectively, imutably existent state of mind, much less is it measurable. Even if it were accepted that these exist, they are still not measurable and thus, people are not qualified to - and have no right to - neither decide what combination of male and female they are mentally, nor demand other people recognize and acknowledge their self-designation. Until such things are actually determined to exist as measurable, imutable, objective states, there is no reason to believe &quot;gender identity&quot; is anything but fantasy.<br><br>Start calling these people by their sex, watch them get mad, and explain that you were merely referring to their &quot;sex identity.&quot; If they protest, ask them why calling them what they are makes them angry.

We haven\u2019t put it in quite yet but we\u2019re going to be doing it soon.&quot; What happened to that plan?<br>2) Trump repeatedly said that he had a plan to defeat ISIS in 30 days, and that he knew more than the generals. Do you believe he had said plan?<br>3) Trump claimed that he lost the popular vote because there were 3 million illegal voters (a number suspiciously close to the gap in the popular vote), and that he would start an investigation into those votes soon. He still hasn&#039;t, and unsurprisingly let the issue slip out of view. Do you believe him despite the lack of evidence?<br>4) Trump said that his inauguration crowd was the largest ever, and even talked to the head of the NPS to try and get better photos lol. Do you think Trump&#039;s inauguration was larger? (The answer here must be no, but then why would Trump even fight this in this first place?)<br><br>These are just 4 things I could come up with off the top of my head, but he&#039;s just been spewing a constant stream of verbal diarrhea and gaslighting since he started the campaign, do you honestly find him trustworthy?

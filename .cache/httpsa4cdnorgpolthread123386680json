As I got older and a bit smarter, I eventually started noticing that something&#039;s not right with pseudonymity and censorship on a &quot;anon&quot; &quot;freedom of speech&quot; forum, then went to 4chan and eventually \/pol\/.

And I swear, I hate you all, but I love you at the same time.","time":1493503746,"resto":123386680,"id":"GPbmED6D","country":"PL","country_name":"Poland"},{"no":123389203,"now":"04\/29\/17(Sat)18:09:07","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123387573\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123387573<\/a><br>The neocohens suck, yes.<br>They are all traitors, especially Perle.","time":1493503747,"resto":123386680,"id":"gLi6\/68V","country":"DE","country_name":"Germany"},{"no":123389215,"now":"04\/29\/17(Sat)18:09:11","name":"Anonymous","com":"postan","time":1493503751,"resto":123386680,"id":"OMxHzfd5","country":"SE","country_name":"Sweden"},{"no":123389232,"now":"04\/29\/17(Sat)18:09:21","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123386680\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123386680<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;you want a woman but you have to put up with this shit<\/span>","filename":"1390604769142","ext":".png","w":396,"h":385,"tn_w":124,"tn_h":121,"tim":1493503761447,"time":1493503761,"md5":"O10w+F0UgWoTnVt6gpri+Q==","fsize":110579,"resto":123386680,"id":"VmslLA1F","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":123389261,"now":"04\/29\/17(Sat)18:09:34","name":"Anonymous","com":"I don&#039;t know if my politics have changed much on the left-right spectrum, but I&#039;ve become far more pro-white and anti-diversity.<br>I also take the JQ more seriously though I&#039;m not emotionally invested in the idea there is a worldwide conspiracy of Jews against all other races.<br>\/blog","time":1493503774,"resto":123386680,"id":"nq2Ggu\/6","country":"NZ","country_name":"New Zealand"},{"no":123389328,"now":"04\/29\/17(Sat)18:10:06","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123386680\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123386680<\/a><br>mfw I used to be a Bernie supporter now I hate the Jews and love Hitler","filename":"IMG_0015","ext":".jpg","w":1800,"h":1000,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":69,"tim":1493503806860,"time":1493503806,"md5":"dB5aCTkH31+vHc195EZIYA==","fsize":91922,"resto":123386680,"id":"wha6GrtM","country":"US","m_img":1,"country_name":"United States"},{"no":123389349,"now":"04\/29\/17(Sat)18:10:15","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123387573\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123387573<\/a><br>This describes me pretty well","filename":"IMG_1588","ext":".gif","w":455,"h":452,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":124,"tim":1493503815083,"time":1493503815,"md5":"CYibsAL4XgfdYFtzYENArA==","fsize":1324465,"resto":123386680,"id":"FJw+QABK","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":123389356,"now":"04\/29\/17(Sat)18:10:17","name":"Anonymous","com":"My transformation:<br><br>Liberal -&gt; Libertarian -&gt; (discover the JQ) -&gt; Full 1488 -&gt; White nationalist","time":1493503817,"resto":123386680,"id":"V0eSit+g","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":123389369,"now":"04\/29\/17(Sat)18:10:25","name":"Anonymous","com":"I voted for a nigger in 2008.","time":1493503825,"resto":123386680,"id":"TTY1TusM","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":123389429,"now":"04\/29\/17(Sat)18:10:52","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123388819\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123388819<\/a><br>The snails carry brain eating parasites from eating cat poo <br>Also meningitis because women cant help but cheat on you with an African hermaphrodite","time":1493503852,"resto":123386680,"id":"2rK1ALqM","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":123389496,"now":"04\/29\/17(Sat)18:11:25","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123386680\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123386680<\/a><br>I was never truly culturally left-wing.<br>I was all for tolerance and stuff, and I first dipped my toe into politics in terms of economic leftism, but even then, I valued traditional social and cultural ideals, and seeing the degeneracy around me pushed me more towards seeing authoritarian means as necessary for herding dirty animalistic riff-raff.","time":1493503885,"resto":123386680,"id":"S4jHT+CW","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":123389541,"now":"04\/29\/17(Sat)18:11:50","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123386680\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123386680<\/a><br>You mean 7th grade?

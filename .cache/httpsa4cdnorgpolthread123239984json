There&#039;s nothing wrong with it, in fact you should be proud of your size. The first step to dealing with your fat is to admit it, now say it fatsos.<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;The next question you have to ask yourself is, \u201cHow does being fat work for me?\u201d <\/span><br>Well, it makes you funnier. Everybody loves a fat guy, they&#039;re really funny.<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Well, I would have to get really fat to get really funny, you say.<\/span><br>No, you just have to be a little dumpy, which is what most of you are now. That&#039;s phase 1. There&#039;s about 8 phases. It starts from dumpy, then it goes to frumpy, then to fat.<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;6 phases of fat.<\/span><br>I don&#039;t know, I&#039;m not a scientist. I&#039;m just saying, \/pol\/ just gets fatter and fatter. You start the cycle and then you don&#039;t stop.<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;How does this help save the white race?<\/span><br>Some girls like fat guys because their fathers were fat, right? So, you play on that. It&#039;s the Fat Father Syndrome, the FFS. Girls have fat fathers, so when you&#039;re fat you remind girls of their father. Done deal.<br>Remember, the key is to approach a woman to help save the white race, then try to get a feel for how fat her father was.","filename":"FFS","ext":".jpg","w":259,"h":194,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":187,"tim":1493410981083,"time":1493410981,"md5":"5nsPaZZICII3x0TqrKAYMA==","fsize":9662,"resto":0,"id":"gy1WeLBS","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"is-ffs-the-key-to-saving-the-white-race","country_name":"United States","replies":0,"images":0,"unique_ips":1}]}

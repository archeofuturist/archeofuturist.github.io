Why not Sudan or Nigeria? This is exactly what it looks like and has been talked about for the last two days on \/pol\/. Trump got his marching orders from Israel, period. We are sick of pointless wars and refugees. Trump promised us that US foreign policy under his watch would be America first and no pointless conflicts. He even criticized the arming of &quot;moderate rebels&quot; in Syria. What he did is the exact opposite of his promise. It is also seen as a huge sign of disrespect in Chinese culture to commit violence while entertaining a guest. They will not take that as a warning, it will only make them believe they have no option for peace. This violates the first principal of strategy, always leave an option for the enemy to sue for peace. Trump should have sent those missiles, and more, to Israel. The world would be better off.","time":1491569885,"resto":119937578,"id":"0WrbbVuV","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":119942395,"now":"04\/07\/17(Fri)08:58:24","name":"awoobaker","com":"<a href=\"#p119942138\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119942138<\/a><br>Thank you.

Ideally I would like a resurgence of Pagan traditions and Gods, but I believe in the current situation we are in, the chasm to achieve this is too large to cross in a single leap. Because of this, I feel Christianity is the only bulwark we have against the tide of degeneracy. Indeed, we must be welcoming to those other sects of Christianity, to bulk up our numbers. To stray too far and they will become fearful and resentful. <br><br>In the same way that Trump was memed to office, in similar regards, I propose we convert the normies to a better, stronger version of Christianity as created by us. I further believe there is fertile ground to do this and bring lost souls into the fray - even those who consider themselves atheists could be persuaded. This is not impossible in a religion. As many of you are aware, among the Jews there are atheists.<br>So what are some of the qualities this new religion needs? What have we learnt and how can we improve? Here are a few I\u2019ve started off with:<br><br>- The Pope has shown his cards and he is weak, so I guess we must be a protestant sect.<br>- We must be hard to differentiate to those who are Christians, and easy to signal to those who are tired of the ills of modern society.<br>- Need some kind of defence mechanism to use when we are inevitably called a cult<br>- Attractive to scientific thinkers and atheists and anyone who has concern with the errs of modern society<br>- I\u2019m not sure if it should be race related initially, but it should be nationalistic to at least postpone incessant immigration.<br>- We must renounce support of Israel? How can we approach this?","filename":"devine comedie","ext":".jpg","w":510,"h":640,"tn_w":199,"tn_h":250,"tim":1492850056425,"time":1492850056,"md5":"dv1hMe3OEr+kT7WqpJMG3Q==","fsize":161594,"resto":0,"id":"LhqfxSmo","country":"GB","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"we-need-to-create-a-reformed-version-of","country_name":"United Kingdom","replies":6,"images":1,"unique_ips":5},{"no":122255284,"now":"04\/22\/17(Sat)04:37:41","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122255083\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122255083<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;It&#039;s another deus vult thread where neckbeards debate bullshit that leads no where in the long run<\/span><br><br>Honestly, it&#039;s better to focus on the ANTIFA threads.

We have learned from the prophets, and we hold it to be true, that punishments, and chastisements, and good rewards, are rendered according to the merit of each man\u2019s actions. Since if it be not so, but all things happen by fate, neither is anything at all in our own power. For if it be fated that this man, e.g., be good, and this other evil, neither is the former meritorious nor the latter to be blamed. And again, unless the human race have the power of avoiding evil and choosing good by free choice, they are not accountable for their actions, of whatever kind they be. But that it is by free choice they both walk uprightly and stumble, we thus demonstrate. We see the same man making a transition to opposite things. Now, if it had been fated that he were to be either good or bad, he could never have been capable of both the opposites, nor of so many transitions. But not even would some be good and others bad, since we thus make fate the cause of evil, and exhibit her as acting in opposition to herself; or that which has been already stated would seem to be true, that neither virtue nor vice is anything, but that things are only reckoned good or evil by opinion; which, as the true word shows, is the greatest impiety and wickedness. But this we assert is inevitable fate, that they who choose the good have worthy rewards, and they who choose the opposite have their merited awards. For not like other things, as trees and quadrupeds, which cannot act by choice, did God make man: for neither would he be worthy of reward or praise did he not of himself choose the good, but were created for this end; nor, if he were evil, would he be worthy of punishment, not being evil of himself, but being able to be nothing else than what he was made.\u201d (ANF01, 1 Justin, Ch.

A Hebrew in Strong&#039;s Concordance is an Eberite, a descendant of Eber, who was an ancestor of Abraham. His name derives from the word thst means other side because his descendants would come to inherit the ends of the inhabited world. His name is found in &quot;Iberia&quot; and &quot;Hibernia&quot;, the Ebro, the other Iberia etc. bdcause these places were inhabited by Hebrews.<br><br>A &quot;Jew&quot; in the Old Testsment is a Judahite, one of the tribe of Judah, not any of the northern tribes of Israel, none of them were ever called &quot;Jews&quot;, not Moses, Abraham, or Jacob. a &quot;Jew&quot; in the NT is an inhabitant of Judea, without any racial implication. Thus Edomites were also called &quot;Jews&quot;. That is all from Strong&#039;s Concordance. No denying Matthew 25:32 and many other verses.","time":1491347993,"resto":119510508,"id":"cMgpyiJa","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":119532603,"now":"04\/04\/17(Tue)19:20:06","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119532208\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119532208<\/a><br>https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=Dno<wbr>rKE_tWHA","time":1491348006,"resto":119510508,"id":"oFOiTWxW","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":119532612,"now":"04\/04\/17(Tue)19:20:09","name":"Anonymous","com":"Redpill me on &#039;God is Real&#039; \/pol\/<br>Athiest trying to be Christian","time":1491348009,"resto":119510508,"id":"5R\/zeO1j","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":119532646,"now":"04\/04\/17(Tue)19:20:26","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119531804\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119531804<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Sola fide BTFO<\/span><br><br>James 2:24 - \u201cYou see that a man is justified by works and not by faith alone.\u201d<br><br>What works justify a man, James?

(NIV)<br><br>1. The English language makes a clear distinction between \u201cGod\u201d and \u201cgod.\u201d Thus, in English Bibles, the heavenly Father is called \u201cGod,\u201d while lesser divinities, people with God\u2019s authority on earth and important people such as kings, are also called \u201cgod\u201d (2 Cor. 4:4; John 10:34 and 35; Acts 12:22). The Hebrew and Aramaic languages cannot make the distinction between \u201cGod\u201d and \u201cgod.\u201d Since Hebrew and Aramaic have only capital letters, every use is \u201cGOD.\u201d Furthermore, although the Greek language has both upper case and lower case letters as English does, the early Greek manuscripts did not blend them. It was the style of writing at the time of the New Testament to make manuscripts in all capital letters, so the Greek manuscripts were, like the Hebrew text, all upper case script. Scholars call these manuscripts \u201cuncials,\u201d and that style was popular until the early ninth century or so when a smaller script was developed for books.

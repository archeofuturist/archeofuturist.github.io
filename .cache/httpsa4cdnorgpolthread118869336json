They are basically implying that even the Democrats are center-right wing. What they are trying to do is to imply that our entire system is right-wing.<br><br>This puts me into a boiling rage because it is such a narrow view. Economically speaking, yes our country is more right than most of the West. But culturally, our country, like all others in the West, could be described as radical-left due to the fact that having in-group preference for your nation is considered evil. The concept that we need to move MORE to the left just boggles my mind. It makes me so fucking angry.<br><br>Bonus: when people say &quot;left vs right is a false dichotomy, its about top vs bottom&quot;. While left vs right is certainly a flawed spectrum, the statement &quot;its top vs bottom&quot; is used almost exclusively by leftists, obviously, to stir class conflict. It fills me with white hot rage when they try to act all impartial and superior and then just parrot a typical leftist talking point. And I feel like people fall for this all the time.","filename":"5613434+_7b63c45659fd0b73614e0d977caa0f55","ext":".png","w":325,"h":275,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":211,"tim":1490840742364,"time":1490840742,"md5":"1\/VapDYLXZUPV\/oAQT5yKw==","fsize":48203,"resto":0,"id":"CIeCP9wF","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"political-statements-that-make-you-extremely-mad","country_name":"United States","replies":0,"images":0,"unique_ips":1}]}

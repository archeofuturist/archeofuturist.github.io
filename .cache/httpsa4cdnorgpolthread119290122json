No steel structure, even under these circumstances, should collapse without warning unless it was designed improperly or it&#039;s a controlled demolition. Massive structures like the two towers would have a significant amount of redundancy, meaning that should one member fail, the forces would redistribute themselves among the remaining members producing a fairly conservative design.<br><br>The heat argument is silly. The steel would perhaps deform plastically nearest the collision area but wouldn&#039;t collapse suddenly and certainly not the members below. We&#039;re talking significant factors of safety and designing steel up to its yield point, not rupture. Then you add the hundreds of millions of metric tonnes of concrete encasing the steel\/spray fireproofing as well as the perimeter\/core columns, and there is no scientifically feasible explanation for the collapse. Similar fires occurred in steel buildings many times in the past and they lasted for DAYS before crumbling partially. The thermal energy released in the explosion wouldn&#039;t be nearly enough to surpass the internal strain energy required to cause such catastrophic deformations. <br><br>Funny how such a colossal, world-shifting event wouldn&#039;t be investigated or used as a textbook case for engineering schools, associations, and materials institutions.

Here&#039;s why....<br><br>1. Structural steel of the interior support columns <br>are made from tungsten titanium alloy. The idea of <br>jet fuel burning outside of it&#039;s fuselage is able to melt these is fucking kindergarten level ridiculousness. <br>Jet fuel only burns at around 500 degrees OUTSIDE <br>of the fuselage. (1500 degrees needed here). On top of that, there was not enough fuel to run down the columns as claimed. The fireball from the impact of the planes is a fuel explosion, hence, most of the fuel detonated on impact. <br><br>2. These buildings were built to withstand MULTIPLE airliner impacts and earthquakes. That is a fact and on record with NYC architects and city planners commission. <br><br>3. Pancaking theory already rejected as a logical fallacy due to building construction and materials. <br><br>4. Building 7 wasn&#039;t even hit by a plane. <br><br><br>That should be enough to start with for the hard of thinking. At the very least, even if a collapse occured, the core columns would still be sticking out of the ground 1000ft in the air, Still standing. You are being lied to. Common sense should tell you this. <br><br><br>As for building 7 theories. Pic related is the Jianye building in south China.

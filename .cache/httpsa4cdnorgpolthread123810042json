were asymmetric conflicts. Guerilla warfare. The thing about asymmetric warfare is that it&#039;s a huge pain in the ass to fight. The US is THE power player of all nations and must adhere to Geneva Conventions and laws of war. We are also human, meaning some have broken such rules\/protocols, but it&#039;s followed nonetheless. That being said, it pretty much forces nations to &quot;play nice.&quot; <br><br>What if we didn&#039;t follow those rules and proceeded to fuck shit up anyways? Probably wouldn&#039;t work out well. If a military force tries to obliterate insurgents\/guerillas in a country without any regard to the innocent populace, it will only cause more of a shit storm and drive more support towards the insurgency. this makes the conflict damn near unwinnable. Instead, US military is more focused on winning the hearts and minds of the locals to greatly assist in fighting insurgency. <br>check out Soviet Russia&#039;s attempt of occupying Afghanistan. They were more ruthless than us, but ended up getting beat bad. Though, we all know why (US supporting local fighters). A good read on this subject is &quot;The Bear Went Over the Mountain: Soviet Combat Tactics in Afghanistan&quot;<br><br>Pit any other nation&#039;s military against the US, they will lose. We&#039;ve kicked ass in more conventional warfare situations though.<br><br>TL;DR: the US has to follow laws of war and play nice.","filename":"1463080974859","ext":".jpg","w":604,"h":453,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":93,"tim":1493757429320,"time":1493757429,"md5":"XftCFXPCrN+l2U8yLHceXQ==","fsize":22366,"resto":123810042,"id":"wBWMT6Pc","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":123816486,"now":"05\/02\/17(Tue)16:43:17","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123813852\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123813852<\/a><br>i hate to be that guy.<br>but you ingest poison, you get injected with venom.","time":1493757797,"resto":123810042,"id":"CUVLRRGJ","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":123817497,"now":"05\/02\/17(Tue)16:51:32","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123815679\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123815679<\/a><br>that&#039;s because you are pussies and drop bombs from miles away onto civilians.<br><br>999 dead civilians + 1 potential dead allah snackbar vs 1 dead &#039;murican<br><br>Great fucking job.","time":1493758292,"resto":123810042,"id":"PtwsNNII","country":"DE","country_name":"Germany"},{"no":123817733,"now":"05\/02\/17(Tue)16:53:30","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123810042\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123810042<\/a><br>We use war as a way to occupy (and thin out) the bottom 60%","time":1493758410,"resto":123810042,"id":"0LzF3CYG","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":123818162,"now":"05\/02\/17(Tue)16:56:38","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123815744\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123815744<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;must adhere to Geneva Conventions and laws of war.<\/span><br><br>kek<br>You are quite funny fatso.<br><br>I guess when your nobel prize nigger bombed that other nobel prize holder, it was just another of those &quot;accidents&quot;.<br>And I guess your Nazi concentration camp is also just an &quot;accident&quot; and not violating any law whatsoever.<br>And your nigger president supporting terrorists in Syria was also just an &quot;accident&quot;.<br><br>Kill yourself, so that the world will be a better place.","time":1493758598,"resto":123810042,"id":"PtwsNNII","country":"DE","country_name":"Germany"},{"no":123818432,"now":"05\/02\/17(Tue)16:58:50","name":"Anonymous","com":"Winning a war is easy. <br><br>You go to Middle East shit hole.<br><br>Besiege city.

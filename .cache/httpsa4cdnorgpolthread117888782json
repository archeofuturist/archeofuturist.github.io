Poland is under European rule, they can&#039;t just do what they want, especially when they&#039;re so reliant on the Union&#039;s financial support. As for Ukraine, I wouldn&#039;t expect it to open a second front in the West when they&#039;re already busy dealing with the rebellion\/ Putin&#039;s men. <br><br>But I thought that M\u00e9lenchon was rather out of touch with geopolitics. He says that we can stop any war and wants to go to the negociations table. I don&#039;t think he knows how diplomacy heavily relies on military dick-measuring and how difficult it is to negociate with warring factions like ISIS, the Al-Nusra Front and Syrian rebels (which are, in my opinion, more of a concern than the Ukraine). I think he also doesn&#039;t understand what giving ground to Putin actually means in terms of geopolitics (=suicide)","time":1490248744,"resto":117888782,"id":"0kKzJ+xR","country":"BE","country_name":"Belgium"},{"no":117896362,"now":"03\/23\/17(Thu)01:59:29","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p117891305\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;117891305<\/a><br>That&#039;s sick as fuck","time":1490248769,"resto":117888782,"id":"mV44cPZ7","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":117896892,"now":"03\/23\/17(Thu)02:04:59","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p117896362\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;117896362<\/a><br>The Meme wars have begun","time":1490249099,"resto":117888782,"id":"4w2XKI+g","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":117897005,"now":"03\/23\/17(Thu)02:06:13","name":"Anonymous","com":"I want to cum inside Marion","filename":"marion-mlp","ext":".jpg","w":700,"h":367,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":65,"tim":1490249173955,"time":1490249173,"md5":"7JQpXH255TtRsHeOmkOtSQ==","fsize":39721,"resto":117888782,"id":"ikt1TR3P","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":117897319,"now":"03\/23\/17(Thu)02:09:36","name":"Anonymous","com":"bump","filename":"16388439_264491393988832_2183239969108724866_n","ext":".jpg","w":480,"h":378,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":98,"tim":1490249376245,"time":1490249376,"md5":"cBRHW24frGN7OPAOtoxm7Q==","fsize":28451,"resto":117888782,"id":"G50ttRKe","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":117897328,"now":"03\/23\/17(Thu)02:09:44","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p117897005\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;117897005<\/a><br>Same here, I wouldn&#039;t pull out.","time":1490249384,"resto":117888782,"id":"4w2XKI+g","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":117897494,"now":"03\/23\/17(Thu)02:11:28","name":"Anonymous","com":"An exchange between Marion Marechal Le Pen and French PM Manuel Valls (ENG SUBS).

I&#039;m from an era of irony, but coming back makes me cringe. Either the irony is as deep as kek himself, or the bolts are are shaking lose. Did kikes purchase the god emperor? Are shills real? Do shills realize that their attacks on 2000 posters could totally get Trump impeached and replaced with commie Sanders? I miss nigger hate threads, good dammit.","filename":"1465613359730","ext":".jpg","w":600,"h":498,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":207,"tim":1491717573679,"time":1491717573,"md5":"Hb1WyFngPkAVH49KF0pv9A==","fsize":246930,"resto":0,"id":"mPQi2Kpn","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"whos-jewing-who","country_name":"United States","replies":3,"images":0,"unique_ips":4},{"no":120247557,"now":"04\/09\/17(Sun)02:02:30","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120247292\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120247292<\/a><br>goddamn they&#039;re getting some shitty shills to type up trash for slide threads now. we don&#039;t want you here faggot.","time":1491717750,"resto":120247292,"id":"cBaJmAAj","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":120248257,"now":"04\/09\/17(Sun)02:10:07","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120247292\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120247292<\/a><br>The situation is this.

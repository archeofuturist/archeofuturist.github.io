The variance of that blood payment depends on the nature of the sin committed.<br><br>Again, playing by Gods own rules, sending a human man, inhabited by the glory and spirit of God in Jesus Christ, would cover the sins of mankind. But only if a blood sacrifice was made. Jesus said that only through him salvation could be found.<br><br>So consider then that if that sacrifice (which follows Gods own rules), was not enough to completely atone for a confessors sins, then why bother?

Christians are still called to a life of holiness and sanctification. Not because we need it to save ourselves, but because it&#039;s right and commanded by God, but also because it sets us apart in the world and demonstrates to others how we live. As Jesus said, we will be known by our fruit - our actions, our deeds, and our examples.<br><br>This argument over demonstrations and traditions and pointless.

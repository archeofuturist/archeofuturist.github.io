You realize some jobs are significantly harder than others to do and hard to come by?

You kids have no fucking clue. I&#039;m going to march tomorrow, I will have no goddamn patience for you stupid fucks. Most of us won&#039;t. We literally keep this goddamn country afloat and you keep extorting more and more from the golden goose. <br><br>Sorry if we fucking didn&#039;t get the popular vote. It doesn&#039;t matter when over half of you don&#039;t contribute. You shouldn&#039;t even have the right to vote if you don&#039;t pay taxes. That&#039;s like giving the rats on a ship an equal say on the destination. <br><br>Half of you are worthless leeches on this great country and as far as I&#039;m concerned your opinion shouldn&#039;t count in a democracy. Hence why only PROPERTY owners (yeah, even freed niggers, redskins, and catholics who were citizens) at the founding of this country were the only ones allowed to vote, because they knew the freeloading renters weren&#039;t 100% loyal to the nation for not having an actual stake in it and could leave at any time with little to no penalty.","filename":"1461766494405","ext":".jpg","w":820,"h":461,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":70,"tim":1492247654547,"time":1492247654,"md5":"sJph0RrHj\/glrhuqYD\/w3A==","fsize":117052,"resto":121190781,"id":"VHCcKbGb","country":"US","country_name":"United States"}]}

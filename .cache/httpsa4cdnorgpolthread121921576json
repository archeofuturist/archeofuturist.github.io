It&#039;s the type of shit that keeps me up at night. <br><br>I like to think of myself as having free will and making my own destiny. And to think that everything good or bad that happens to me is a result of the Lord? It&#039;s just insane and discredits all the hard work or accountability pf my actions. <br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Hey cousin Ben is in the hospital, he&#039;s got a blood transfusion and is getting better!<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;thank God!<\/span><br>This automatically discredits the actual tangibility of the doctors and medicene involved to make Ben better. <br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;hey your drinking problem is hetting way out of hand<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;I know!

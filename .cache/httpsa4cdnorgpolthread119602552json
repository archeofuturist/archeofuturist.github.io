I had no friends, I had no social contact whatsoever. FSA filled the void that being able to go an entire day without opening my mouth once had left in my brain. YPG didn&#039;t exist at the time. With FSA I developed an interest in islam, arabic, beheadings, and recently svbieds. I&#039;m glad that you feel so secure and loved . I&#039;m glad that you&#039;re part of a community like the FSA where everyone is so well adjusted you don&#039;t ever feel the need to call someone a stupid degenerate fucking pedophile because they&#039;re married to an 8 year old. I&#039;m glad that you&#039;re so fucking well adjusted that you don&#039;t feel the need to jump in and call that guy a jihadist and a moderate beheader and everything else you can think up. So I&#039;m sorry I go support the FSA. I&#039;m sorry if that offends you. I wish I didn&#039;t have to. I wish communities like this wouldn&#039;t throw people like me out because we&#039;re not secular enough and not civil enough. I&#039;m sorry every second word out of my mouth is bakeries and every third one is hospital. I&#039;m sorry that the only people who want to talk to me are islamists, kikes and losers. But I&#039;m also sorry that you&#039;ll never be exposed to a community that&#039;s violent, religious and sponsored by saudis and you&#039;ll never grow a beard thick enough to matter. I&#039;m sorry that you&#039;ll never come to the realisation that ignoring things doesn&#039;t make them go away.

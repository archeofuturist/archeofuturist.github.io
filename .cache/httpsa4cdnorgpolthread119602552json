Including request of Damascus of March 2013 of use of sarin by rebels. This inaction encouraged these actions and they committed more actions in Aug 2013 when they used Sarin. That attack coincided with meeting with Professor Delstrom. It was possible to achieve chem demilitarization of Syria. In complex conditions and brief time franes, syria eliminated chem weapons, then we saw use of cholrine. Fact finding missions was supported by Syria, but these missions never visited the sites where chlorine was allegedly used. In investigatin cases of chem weaopns in Syria, reports fabricated by syrian oppo and ngo`s, these reports were taken at face value and non one sought objective investigation. Use of sarin was staged, look at videos that were filmed by certain ngos.

In preambular, it should be stated that sec council with deep regret of chem weapons use, and in that preambular it should be noted that investigation is needed to find out who is responisble. In initial part of operative part should condemn use of chem weapons, &quot;for fact finding mission to conduct thoroughly the reports on condition that the staff of investigative mission should be introduced to sec council and represent geographical balance, have access to areas of rebels where incident took place. Main task now is to have objective inquirty into what happenned. Falsified reports of this incident has come from helmets and SOHR, sources that have been discretided long ago. To take ther reports at face value is a joke. W. helmets are getting mixed up in their reports, speak of helicopters, aircraft, then it is sarin, or chloring, change number of victims, they act unprofessionally. Behavior of these guys is very relaxed which brings one to question reliablity. Looks provocative. In preamble, it expresses &quot;the horror&quot; as if the facts were all checked. HAVE YOU EVEN CHECKED WHAT YOU WROTE? In other words, this draft was written hastily and to approve it would not be very serious of sec council. As for alleged attack on terrorist area that has been controlled by terrorists since... it is true syrian aviation conducted strike in easter egde, in a warehouse, and in that terrirtory there was facility of chem weapons. <\/span><br>fuck he talks to fast but you get the gist of it.","time":1491406654,"resto":119602552,"id":"ImeCyZz5","country":"BR","country_name":"Brazil"},{"no":119617560,"now":"04\/05\/17(Wed)11:38:12","name":"Anonymous","com":"Whos was the most disgusting war shill who has spoken?my vote goes on the french guy","time":1491406692,"resto":119602552,"id":"U2YzlPEI","country":"PT","country_name":"Portugal"},{"no":119617624,"now":"04\/05\/17(Wed)11:38:48","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119604612\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119604612<\/a><br>gay as fuck","time":1491406728,"resto":119602552,"id":"dGxr8bCF","country":"IL","country_name":"Israel"},{"no":119617656,"now":"04\/05\/17(Wed)11:39:10","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119617158\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119617158<\/a><br>They want pootin stay in power, can sacrifice al-assad for that.","time":1491406750,"resto":119602552,"id":"FlBQtYfC","country":"RU","country_name":"Russian Federation"},{"no":119617665,"now":"04\/05\/17(Wed)11:39:16","name":"Anonymous","com":"somebody bake pls","time":1491406756,"resto":119602552,"id":"mvP\/Cr0p","country":"IT","country_name":"Italy"},{"no":119617676,"now":"04\/05\/17(Wed)11:39:23","name":"Anonymous","com":"https:\/\/www.c-span.org\/video\/?42656<wbr>2-1\/senators-marco-rubio-ben-cardin<wbr>-react-syrian-chemical-attack&amp;live<br><br>wtf I hate assad now","time":1491406763,"resto":119602552,"id":"qkKmjDgJ","country":"SE","country_name":"Sweden"},{"no":119617718,"now":"04\/05\/17(Wed)11:39:44","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119617560\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119617560<\/a><br>UK imo, did the US speak already?<br>Good old times when samantha powers started quoting twitterposts, feels like yesterday","filename":"1484255809929","ext":".png","w":549,"h":280,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":63,"tim":1491406784079,"time":1491406784,"md5":"ILB6MmXaYEKDrpAQOfjvDQ==","fsize":190108,"resto":119602552,"id":"pFITQzxT","country":"BE","country_name":"Belgium"},{"no":119617768,"now":"04\/05\/17(Wed)11:40:07","name":"SG Official Veter\u00e1n","com":"BREAD<br><br><a href=\"\/pol\/thread\/119617706#p119617706\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119617706<\/a><br><a href=\"\/pol\/thread\/119617706#p119617706\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119617706<\/a><br><a href=\"\/pol\/thread\/119617706#p119617706\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119617706<\/a><br><a href=\"\/pol\/thread\/119617706#p119617706\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119617706<\/a>","filename":"best bakery","ext":".jpg","w":604,"h":453,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":93,"tim":1491406807408,"time":1491406807,"md5":"51\/56M2nVNfEaFjQtANKqg==","fsize":54576,"resto":119602552,"id":"k958xt0v","country":"PL","country_name":"Poland"},{"no":119617779,"now":"04\/05\/17(Wed)11:40:11","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119602552\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119602552<\/a><br><br>Asked in another thread but didn&#039;t get a straight answer:<br><br>Why, if we back the Syrian rebels as part of the proxy war against Russia, who backs Assad, would Obama send a literal plane load full of currency, to Iran, who also backs Assad?","time":1491406811,"resto":119602552,"id":"2JyaNYXD","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":119617790,"now":"04\/05\/17(Wed)11:40:17","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119617676\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119617676<\/a><br>ITS RUBIOOOOOOOOOOO","time":1491406817,"resto":119602552,"id":"KYYn5RNh","country":"RO","country_name":"Romania"},{"no":119617804,"now":"04\/05\/17(Wed)11:40:22","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119616798\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119616798<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;that guilty talkativeness of caught crook<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Russians sound sane and reasonable<\/span>","filename":"piedras","ext":".jpg","w":300,"h":57,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":23,"tim":1491406822510,"time":1491406822,"md5":"hfTC5AH02M8Ok9q+ZwwWbg==","fsize":3385,"resto":119602552,"id":"FlBQtYfC","country":"RU","country_name":"Russian Federation"},{"no":119617960,"now":"04\/05\/17(Wed)11:41:44","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119617779\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119617779<\/a><br>because the iran deal wasn&#039;t actually that bad.

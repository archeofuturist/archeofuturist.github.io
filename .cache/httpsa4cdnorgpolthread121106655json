The springy corrugations dissipate energy and the projos bounce off. The immortal Corten steel shells last centuries even without paint, which is only decorative. The US Navy has a fleet of containers at the bottom of the Marianas trench where they dock submarines made from containers for underwater replenishment. Hawaii successfully used lava flow to encase containers to make attractive tourist lodges. Transatmospheric scramjet powered containers have been developed into launch platforms for smaller containers to be used in the post-Brexit EU space containerstation. North Korea replaced their old dug shelters under mountains with containers painted like mountains. (The insides are painted with cute anime characters to boost morale.) Elon Musk prototyped an electric container to replace the Tesla since the container is more aesthetically appealing than the car and has a lot more battery room. The mayor of Detroit has decided to replace his decaying city with containers. The old buildings will be demolished and the rubble hauled off in other containers, loaded onto rafts made of containers, and shipped to China via the St. Lawrence seaway where it will be ground up and the metal residue used to make more containers. US Navy SEALS stealthily infiltrate enemy ports using containers cunningly disguised as containers. Israel is solving the Palestinian problem by storing them in containers. (Germany tried to solve the Jewish problem using wooden freight cars, but the container hadn&#039;t been invented yet.) Donald Trumps border wall will be easily affordable if built from containers. Any Beaners who slip in by other routes can be detained in containers then trucked to Beanland where containers will be donated as housing.","time":1492223113,"resto":121106655,"id":"tqWXBSP3","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":121154714,"now":"04\/14\/17(Fri)22:26:43","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121130267\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121130267<\/a><br>I&#039;m fucking jelly","time":1492223203,"resto":121106655,"id":"pmzzfeH1","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":121155133,"now":"04\/14\/17(Fri)22:30:05","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121138396\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121138396<\/a><br>Fairbanks checking in.

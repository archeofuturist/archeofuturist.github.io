Don&#039;t fuck up this time.<br><br>Some info:<br>Ethereum has improved every technical aspect of bitcoin combined with having a built in programming language for infinite versatility. You could run an election on ethereum through smart contacts and it wouldn&#039;t be possible to even claim that &quot;the election was hacked&quot; as you could just check the code and pseudonymous transaction list yourself. Ethereum will also be the ultimate escrow service rendering banks completely useless. Want to bet with other 4channers anonymously about what outcome topic X will have? Make a smart contract that will release the money to the winner once the outcome is settled. <br><br>The Enterprise Ethereum Alliance (Microsoft, Intel, JP Morgan, Deloitte etc) are currently in the process of building decentralized applications (dApps) on top of Ethereum. All of this will increase the value of Ethereum by an absurd amount. Some of their prototypes will be released here:<br><br>http:\/\/dapps.ethercasts.com\/<br><br>Other Ethereum related news can be found here:<br>https:\/\/cointelegraph.com\/<br>https:\/\/bitcointalk.org\/index.php?t<wbr>opic=428589.13040<br><br>Monitor price here:<br>cryptowat.ch<br><br>You can get Ethereum from coinbase or Kraken. Or buy bitcoins at localbitcoins.com and trade it for Ethereum on Poloniex.

Not just for being overly emotional and badly written, but for trying to toot its own horn about being progressive and representative of LGBTQ.

Never shown a gay kiss. They&#039;re affectionate, but they puss out at every opportunity to be real about it. <br><br>Remember when Avatar&#039;s creators scolded people for having &quot;hetero glasses&quot; when they questioned if Korra and Asami were romantic with each other? After 4 seasons of a show and the literal final seconds showed them holding hands and walking into some portal together?

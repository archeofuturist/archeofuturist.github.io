You get this with capitalism with maybe some mixed economy notions thrown into the mix. (Highways, roads, water, sewage, electricity, police, firemen, etc. are not privatized for ethical and practical reasons.)<br><br>You get this with a dedicated high tech military. White guys, black guys, hispanic dudes. Doesn&#039;t matter. Fuck being a hyphenated American. All those motherfuckers risk their lives and die as soldiers and troops in the name of the United States of America. We all contribute.<br><br>This is what you should identify with.

They have a population of 1.35 billion to our 327 million. To avoid a WWIII nuclear war scenario, we will likely have to secede *some* areas that we control within the South China Sea. It remains risky militarily and politically due to South Korea, Japan, and the Philippines, but China will need the natural resources of the South China Sea to continue on their path from deadly communism toward a capitalist democracy.<br><br>If America wishes to maintain THEIR status as a superpower it will need to repay its national debt, by far the largest in the world. China holds the largest chunk of American debt. The national debt is $19 TRILLION. The only realistic way of paying it off is to have enormous economic and steady population growth from our citizens. We will also need EQUAL and FAIR trade from other nations. Trump is currently in the process of fixing the largest of our trade deficits with China at $347 BILLION by increasing our exports to them by getting rid of their tariffs and altering their weaker currency. (The extremely dangerous North Korean nuke issue needs to be prioritized above this issue for now.)<br><br>Steady population and economic growth in the USA will also guarantee our status as a superpower to avoid the risk of economic sanctions that a challenger superpower can impose on it.","filename":"F-35-double-break-820x450","ext":".jpg","w":820,"h":450,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":68,"tim":1492667472717,"time":1492667472,"md5":"GryYjnMWpALcTF6ZesJdXw==","fsize":59708,"resto":121959876,"id":"bDa93kU7","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":121960052,"now":"04\/20\/17(Thu)01:51:48","name":"Anonymous","com":"PART 3<br><br>As a final note, we also have another danger to our nation. It&#039;s coming from within and it&#039;s a cancer. We see it in our universities, schools, young kids at Berkeley and Portland, and many parts of media. I&#039;m not talking about things like an unemployment office, food stamps, or a negative income tax\/universal basic income. I&#039;m talking about a violent ideology that dwarfs the 17 million war deaths caused by German Nazis. <br><br>We have a growing communism problem.<br><br>This cannot be allowed to continue. The first step in Mao&#039;s communist rise was cultural Marxism infecting the youth. Once war struck and economic hardship hit the country, the ideology eventually led to the deaths of 45 MILLION (low estimate). Stalin&#039;s communism after WWI led to the deaths of 40 MILLION (again low estimate).<br><br>Don&#039;t think you&#039;re safe. This needs to be stopped now, or you could end up dead.<br><br>The solution is to peacefully engage in diplomatic and respectful debate and\/or cooperative discussion with these people. EXPLAIN to them how dangerous their economic model is. Show them Venezuela. Capitalism (with some mixed economic policies) coupled with FAIR and EQUAL international trade (with limits on cultural globalism) is synonymous with peace and prosperity. <br><br>MAGA.<br><br><br>TLDR: <br>American Military tech is a better symbol for this board.<br>We have another rising nation we must learn to deal with while Making America Great Again.<br>We have a dangerous ideology growing in the US.","filename":"Apache","ext":".jpg","w":768,"h":490,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":79,"tim":1492667508683,"time":1492667508,"md5":"5eRoaVZ35kNNkrdEiZNoYA==","fsize":89864,"resto":121959876,"id":"bDa93kU7","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":121960244,"now":"04\/20\/17(Thu)01:53:49","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121959876\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121959876<\/a><br>WOW.<br><br>People still build ships, even though Point Defense systems can&#039;t protect them against hypersonic missiles?<br><br>I suppose there&#039;s still a few shit-tier countries to bully with big bad ships.

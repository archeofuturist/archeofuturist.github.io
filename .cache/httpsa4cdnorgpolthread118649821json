The Greeks knew this, why don&#039;t you?<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;The fact that the Mediterranean race is responsible for the most important of ancient western civilisations was a problem for the promoters of Nordic superiority. According to Giuseppe Sergi, the Mediterranean race was the &quot;greatest race of the world&quot; and was singularly responsible for the most accomplished civilisations of ancient times, including those of Mesopotamia, Persia, Egypt, Greece, Phoenicia, Carthage, and Rome. The Mediterranean race was also a major influence to the outside world in the modern era: Portugal established the first global empire in history, during the 16th century, followed contemporary by Spain, setting both nations in the highest dominion of political and economics powers in Europe.<\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;C. G. Seligman also stated that &quot;it must, I think, be recognised that the Mediterranean race has actually more achievements to its credit than any other race, since it is responsible for by far the greater part of Mediterranean civilisation, certainly before 1000 BC (and probably much later), and so shaped not only the Aegean cultures, but those of Western as well as the greater part of Eastern Mediterranean lands, while the culture of their near relatives, the Hamitic pre-dynastic Egyptians, formed the basis of that of Egypt.&quot;<\/span>","filename":"1434897356718","ext":".png","w":1000,"h":657,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":164,"tim":1490708797203,"time":1490708797,"md5":"evjkl+d+V1SuhuaY4p85Gw==","fsize":197515,"resto":0,"id":"lFfg2lnO","country":"CA","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"mediterraneanism","country_name":"Canada","replies":16,"images":3,"unique_ips":13},{"no":118650283,"now":"03\/28\/17(Tue)09:52:15","name":"Anonymous","com":"WE WUZ ZEUS N SHIET","time":1490709135,"resto":118649821,"id":"GBo2EHgy","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":118650482,"now":"03\/28\/17(Tue)09:54:12","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118649821\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118649821<\/a><br>Source for map?

It took a while to let go, and when I did going back to church was very hard, but prayer came much easier. And that&#039;d be my advice to you, pray daily, like when you hop into bed at the end of the night just start talking to God. If it feels silly at first whatever, just deal with it and talk; you don&#039;t have to follow any specific form, no eyes closed requirement, or hands steepled\/folded. You don&#039;t have to say any magic words, most of my praying I just start like it&#039;s a conversation that we&#039;re picking up after a long pause (which it really is come to think of it). There&#039;s no rules about asking for things that&#039;re too big or too small (don&#039;t always expect a yes) you just need to have contact with your creator.<br><br>It&#039;s like a muscle, the more you use it, the easier it gets (I tell some people it&#039;s like being in AA, fake it til you make it); and after a while you&#039;ll start seeing some answers that you might not&#039;ve noticed before. More than that prayer is the most cathartic thing you can do in your life. God is tortured by the fact we aren&#039;t able to be with him, and we feel only a fraction of that, but when you talk to him you&#039;ll be surprised at how just full your heart feels.<br><br>Just don&#039;t give up, don&#039;t ever give up anon, your Father loves you, and your brothers and sisters down here do too","filename":"1486097266412","ext":".png","w":381,"h":512,"tn_w":93,"tn_h":125,"tim":1491886180269,"time":1491886180,"md5":"bQB7lLtr3DEexTq1gST+rA==","fsize":184544,"resto":120553388,"id":"4Z6b6vns","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":120555026,"now":"04\/11\/17(Tue)00:49:45","name":"Anonymous","com":"From Previous Thread:<br><a href=\"\/pol\/thread\/120546692#p120552800\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120552800<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;prayers<\/span><br><br>Usually the prayers are posted in the confessional for people who...well, are a bit rusty.<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;what to confess<\/span><br><br>See:<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;http:\/\/www.vatican.va\/archive\/ENG0<wbr>015\/_INDEX.HTM<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;because 4chan thinks URL shorteners are spam<\/span><br><br>Part 3: Life in Christ<br>Section 2: The Ten Commandments<br><br>Pretty straightforward.

It&#039;s like people know nothing of the world of politics. It&#039;s all theater. But then again, Trump accumulated a lot of first time ever voters. If you think Trump is going to be some kind of ideological puritan, well get used to murky waters. There so much information and misinformation being pushed out by everyone, not a single person on this board could possibly have the full picture. Don&#039;t have a meltdown when you see a troublesome headline.<br><br>I mean, how the fuck are we supposed to really know what&#039;s happening 15,000 miles away on the other side of the world in a desert land torn asunder by civil war with multiple warring factions and secret backers all trying to manipulate the intelligence market? Shit, most people get lied to by people around them and can&#039;t tell the difference.<br><br>Think of Trump&#039;s candidacy as a reality show. Seriously. We voted for him based on what we though we might get out of it, and that&#039;s the most any of us could have done, short of real political activism. But that involves leaving the house and that&#039;s for suckers. We handed him the keys to the car and now he&#039;s gonna gonna drive us. Don&#039;t feel so personally culpable if something happens that you don&#039;t like because it out of our hands now. And remember that Trump is governing ALL the citizen of the United States. This includes the 63,000,000 who actually wanted Hillary.

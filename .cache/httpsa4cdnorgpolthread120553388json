It took a while to let go, and when I did going back to church was very hard, but prayer came much easier. And that&#039;d be my advice to you, pray daily, like when you hop into bed at the end of the night just start talking to God. If it feels silly at first whatever, just deal with it and talk; you don&#039;t have to follow any specific form, no eyes closed requirement, or hands steepled\/folded. You don&#039;t have to say any magic words, most of my praying I just start like it&#039;s a conversation that we&#039;re picking up after a long pause (which it really is come to think of it). There&#039;s no rules about asking for things that&#039;re too big or too small (don&#039;t always expect a yes) you just need to have contact with your creator.<br><br>It&#039;s like a muscle, the more you use it, the easier it gets (I tell some people it&#039;s like being in AA, fake it til you make it); and after a while you&#039;ll start seeing some answers that you might not&#039;ve noticed before. More than that prayer is the most cathartic thing you can do in your life. God is tortured by the fact we aren&#039;t able to be with him, and we feel only a fraction of that, but when you talk to him you&#039;ll be surprised at how just full your heart feels.<br><br>Just don&#039;t give up, don&#039;t ever give up anon, your Father loves you, and your brothers and sisters down here do too","filename":"1486097266412","ext":".png","w":381,"h":512,"tn_w":93,"tn_h":125,"tim":1491886180269,"time":1491886180,"md5":"bQB7lLtr3DEexTq1gST+rA==","fsize":184544,"resto":120553388,"id":"4Z6b6vns","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":120555026,"now":"04\/11\/17(Tue)00:49:45","name":"Anonymous","com":"From Previous Thread:<br><a href=\"\/pol\/thread\/120546692#p120552800\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120552800<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;prayers<\/span><br><br>Usually the prayers are posted in the confessional for people who...well, are a bit rusty.<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;what to confess<\/span><br><br>See:<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;http:\/\/www.vatican.va\/archive\/ENG0<wbr>015\/_INDEX.HTM<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;because 4chan thinks URL shorteners are spam<\/span><br><br>Part 3: Life in Christ<br>Section 2: The Ten Commandments<br><br>Pretty straightforward.

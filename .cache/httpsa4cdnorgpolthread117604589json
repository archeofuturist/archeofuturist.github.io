These four pillars (Pater, Filius, Spiritus Sanctus, Deus) are the foundations of all Western Civilization, and you have been brainwashed against this organisation with various conspiracies and unfounded accusations. <br><br><br>The Catholics never stood for the Judaic\/Talmudic traditions; reinvented the cult leader Jesus Christ as a savior and God to undermine and ridicule Jewish theology; and replaced the Monotheistic Dictator EL \/ YHWW with their holy trinity a nod to Ancient Egypt, the last great empire before Rome and a constant reminder to the Jew that he shall be subjugated or expelled.<br><br><br>If you are a Christian and NOT a Catholic you are a servant of the Jews. Through willful or ignorant manipulation and deception, you have embraced an ideology that does not care for you, will build nothing for you, and expect you to sacrifice everything when the time comes for you to do so.<br><br><br>There obviously is no God, not in the theological or spiritual sense. There is only power, and various groups of men strong and wise enough to wield it. Pick carefully who you side with, despite many historical infiltrators of the inner sanctum of the Vatican and today the Papacy itself corrupted by a crypto-kike Jesuit, at it&#039;s core there are still loyalists to the Catholic cause, and justice will prevail. The Church remains, the buildings still stand, and their light and knowledge, which built Europa and the Renaissance and Enlightenment, raised your ancestors out of darkness and into prosperity, will shine again.","filename":"Vatican ceremony","ext":".jpg","w":1600,"h":1067,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":166,"tim":1490084259587,"time":1490084259,"md5":"O6MomI8rng1fLl9XXf12QQ==","fsize":597229,"resto":0,"id":"FbN+3D0H","country":"AU","m_img":1,"bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"a-gentle-reminder-that-undermining-the-catholic","country_name":"Australia","replies":0,"images":0,"unique_ips":1}]}

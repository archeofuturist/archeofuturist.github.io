I am a depressive, I became of depressive quite young at 9 years old. The reason was, my mom had cancer, and at the time my mom and dad were divorced. I didn&#039;t like my dad at the time, he was sometimes quite cruel (He&#039;s different now). But I felt like if my mom died I would have no one. I live in a place with a national health service, the doctors saved my mother&#039;s life both during her first and second diagnoses. To this day I take depression medication covered by the national health insurance. If the health care was privatized I and my mother would probably be dead. So why in hell would I, or anyone, want to support a system that kills people off because they weren&#039;t lucky enough to be born rich. And I don&#039;t want to hear about &quot;well it&#039;s not capitalism it&#039;s corporatism&quot; Capitalism is still a market, it is still privatized. So if you think you can just sit there and spout some bullshit and hoping you&#039;ll just get rich once this capitalism comes around, you are living a pipe dream. And you know what, Cuba has done more for people like my mother and me than any capitalist country, despite people calling it a terrible communist dictatorship. Their nationalized medical research has developed four cancer vaccines, and they aren&#039;t doing it for money. So piss off, the lot of you.","filename":"RoL6rYTL","ext":".png","w":256,"h":256,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":250,"tim":1490472446822,"time":1490472446,"md5":"V5+l\/7GxVQuJxWkZ9SIdpQ==","fsize":42497,"resto":0,"id":"3QhUMgig","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"so-im-going-to-delve-into-some-personal-stuff-i","country_name":"United States","replies":4,"images":2,"unique_ips":5},{"no":118265696,"now":"03\/25\/17(Sat)16:09:36","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118265468\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118265468<\/a><br>This is now a rat thread","filename":"cda6db63c43ed7976c480edab9721601","ext":".jpg","w":900,"h":1164,"tn_w":96,"tn_h":124,"tim":1490472576174,"time":1490472576,"md5":"\/XZvstsUIhLkpYAXZ+Lc4Q==","fsize":662752,"resto":118265468,"id":"lvJzbjWD","country":"US","m_img":1,"country_name":"United States"},{"no":118265706,"now":"03\/25\/17(Sat)16:09:41","name":"Anonymous","com":"Parasite piece of shit","time":1490472581,"resto":118265468,"id":"Rd1qyb8j","country":"ES","country_name":"Spain"},{"no":118266171,"now":"03\/25\/17(Sat)16:13:48","name":"Anonymous","com":"Sayge","time":1490472828,"resto":118265468,"id":"o\/KLgc+F","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":118266177,"now":"03\/25\/17(Sat)16:13:52","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118265468\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118265468<\/a><br>If you try to start a communist revolution I&#039;ll kill you and the rest of your family with cancer.","filename":"kid","ext":".jpg","w":408,"h":604,"tn_w":84,"tn_h":125,"tim":1490472832818,"time":1490472832,"md5":"brj2AwqKnyaB97eYQvK02g==","fsize":33350,"resto":118265468,"id":"iJscF3LO","country":"US","country_name":"United States"}]}

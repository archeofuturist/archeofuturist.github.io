This has literally been his plan all along, and Rand Paul\/Ted Cruz know this. If you have not noticed they have been Trumpeting The Art of The Deal when it comes to negotiating for changes, while also seemingly being very aware of this when after talking to Trump and not taking him to terms on him selling the bill as it currently stands. Basically Trump is setting up a home run grand slam for them, and they know it.","time":1490176112,"resto":117732242,"id":"vd1zskup","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":117743545,"now":"03\/22\/17(Wed)05:50:55","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p117734615\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;117734615<\/a><br>...of uphill battles, and his still done more than any other president in his first several weeks.<br>there&#039;s a fucking coup by the former presdient on this country. why are we even talking about budget cuts?!<br>there&#039;s a cold civil war on in this country right now. stop pretending everything is okay, it&#039;s not.<br><br>we need to reeducate about 25% of this country on how our government works. they&#039;ve been brainwashed into thinking a fascist was elected.<br>where does that rank with budget cuts?<br>how are we going to get our friends and families de-programmed?<br>isn&#039;t that a little more important?","time":1490176255,"resto":117732242,"id":"qBEBaJDN","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":117743553,"now":"03\/22\/17(Wed)05:51:06","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p117743110\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;117743110<\/a><br>Schlomo are you even trying anymore?","time":1490176266,"resto":117732242,"id":"+QVuw8NT","country":"CA","country_name":"Canada"},{"no":117743670,"now":"03\/22\/17(Wed)05:53:20","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p117742892\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;117742892<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt; Considering the US life expectancy is actually decreasing<\/span><br>Not related to healthcare, but lifestyle and murder.<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt; but the regulations are lobbied for by the very people you are protecting.<\/span><br>No, the regulations are supported by the AMA to reduce the supply of medical professional so that the medical professionals can earn more money.<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Prices for a good or service cost what people are willing to pay for them, they are completely detached from any other factor.<\/span><br>No, it isn&#039;t, look up consumer surplus.

Nothing the man has done has worked or has been hyperbole. The health care plan is stupid as hell, we nearly had the swiss model in this country. If he had wanted to make America Great Again, than gut medicaid, make basic healthcare plans compulsory with basic health coverage required, and make it so insurance companies cannot profit off the compulsory plans and cannot exclude on the basis of age or health. Thus everyone will be able to afford a healthcare plan, no one is on the public dime, and the healthcare pool is filled with healthy and not healthy people. That said, the Swiss plans have low deductibles and optional supplementary plans that can be sold at a profit. But we wont even have this, instead we got something that will doom alot of people to death and illness... Basically what we had prior to 2010 but even more to the insurance companies advantage.<br><br>I voted for a man who was going to make this country great, instead he wastes times on stupid shit.

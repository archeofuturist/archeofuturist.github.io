The British army didn&#039;t march around killing off every tribe in the territories they controlled. In fact, much like the French, they allied with many of them. Hell, one of the causes of the American Revolution was that the British denied any further settlement westward onto Indian lands which upset many of the British-American colonists. There are several reasons as to why you don&#039;t see many American Indians in North America. For starters, there weren&#039;t that many to being with; the land was sparsely populated when the Europeans arrived. Birth rates were very low for them compared to the Europeans; many of them were nomadic tribes, and nomads tend not to have many children due to their lifestyle that involves them constantly being on the move. They were simply outbred; you had many American Indians, particularly women, marrying white men. It was a boost in status for them and offered a higher quality of life. This is why there are a large number of whites in the U.S. who have a very small percentage of American Indian in them. That&#039;s not to say that there wasn&#039;t any war involved; there was, but it wasn&#039;t a major cause of death.","time":1490522403,"resto":118343306,"id":"fw2s0ak1","country":"US","country_name":"United States"}]}

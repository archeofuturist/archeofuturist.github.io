(Florence) <br><br>Was expecting Syrian refugees to be the most revolting things i&#039;d come across while in these areas, well, thats what I assumed from what \/pol\/ was telling me. But you fucks did not warn me about the absolute scum on this earth that we refer to as Gypsies. Like, ffs I felt like literally everywhere I went I was getting some sort of plastic cup, or picture of some degenerate shit skinned kids shoved in my face. I fucking hated these abominations yet I have to admit that they&#039;re clever little shits and know how to take advantage of other tourists. The most common place I saw them skulking around were the really tourist magnety places, for example their was a small militia of them camping the line right outside of the Duomo, cups, and whatever trinkets they could find in hand. The worst part about it, is while they&#039;re dumb as bread, so are other tourists who fall for their bullshit and throw money at them like some kind of sideshow. It makes me sick to my stomach. I also found it sort of hilarious that when you tell them to fuck off, they get mad at ME like i&#039;m the greasy five foot tall leech shoving a cup in their face. Anyway, aside from that I really enjoyed my time in these places and hope I can come back again one day. Another thing I want to point out is I actually found Somalians\/North Africans, to be more scummy than the Muhammads. Sitting on street corners trying to sell cheap nick knacks for ridiculously high prices. How do you Europeans deal with this shit?","filename":"1450676876496","ext":".jpg","w":246,"h":246,"tn_w":246,"tn_h":246,"tim":1491164156417,"time":1491164156,"md5":"80CArjtqFTSY8nGobLKy1w==","fsize":22261,"resto":0,"id":"J5bTk2OQ","country":"CA","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"scumbags-in-europe","country_name":"Canada","replies":5,"images":1,"unique_ips":5},{"no":119241271,"now":"04\/02\/17(Sun)16:23:34","name":"Anonymous","com":"And i&#039;d just like to clarify that no I did not deal with any of these kinds of people in London, so congrats Brits you&#039;re slightly less scummy than the rest of your continent.","time":1491164614,"resto":119240456,"id":"J5bTk2OQ","country":"CA","country_name":"Canada"},{"no":119241395,"now":"04\/02\/17(Sun)16:24:45","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119240456\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119240456<\/a><br>How the fuck does a leaf tell the difference between a Syrian and a Gypsy","time":1491164685,"resto":119240456,"id":"nW4OJsrt","country":"BE","country_name":"Belgium"},{"no":119241675,"now":"04\/02\/17(Sun)16:27:02","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119240456\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119240456<\/a><br>Anyone have any tips on avoiding\/dealing with these scum?

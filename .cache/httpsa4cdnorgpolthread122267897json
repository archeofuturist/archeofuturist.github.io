Sit in an office all day as you burn out your brain staring at a screen working on intellectual problems. Marketed to society as great jobs because corporations need to lower wages by increasing supply of STEM workers.<br><br>Women don&#039;t study STEM because it is hard and they aren&#039;t interested in doing that shit. Feminists magically want women to be 50% of STEM jobs so that it goes towards women being paid the same overall (not for the same job, just overall). Feminists want STEM jobs to be easier or something now so that women can do them. All fucking hilarious. Please go do STEM jobs and I will glady work in customer service at Ikea and fuck you when you get home late from your STEM job. This is the world I want. I want what feminists want.

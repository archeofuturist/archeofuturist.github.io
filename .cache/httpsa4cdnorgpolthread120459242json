No takers? 2000 miles, two days at nights at any of our partnered hotels, free car rental. No takers? 2500 miles first class, free Hertz for a month, $200 VISA giftcard. This is how you get passengers to self-select for who really needs to go, make the customer happy, and save the airline from incident in one swoop.

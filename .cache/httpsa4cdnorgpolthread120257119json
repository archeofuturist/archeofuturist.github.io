Also with the global state of affairs it seems somewhat hopeless. The climate is changing, kids aren&#039;t getting vaxxed, there&#039;s Islamic terrorists out to get everyone, and here we are living it better. Some people feel guilty they have it good, and also having it good doesn&#039;t always make things good. A study done suggested that sometimes we need pain to better appreciate pleasure as our bodies begin to develop a resistance to over saturation of pleasure center chemicals. Once that resistance reaches a certain level, pleasing things stop being pleasing, and people begin to lapse. Overall there&#039;s a lot of factors, and while you&#039;re part-right, depression is something complex that can have very real results.","time":1491727129,"resto":120257119,"id":"LnWZG7fT","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":120260199,"now":"04\/09\/17(Sun)04:42:06","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120257634\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120257634<\/a><br>dude im depressed as FUCK because my mom died of cancer (single mom too FUCK BRO) and i pretty much agree, i wish people had taught me how life was all my life instead of being a faggot babying me (fucking single mothers FUCK)<br>i&#039;m trying anyway <br>saged","filename":"1479039521080","ext":".jpg","w":211,"h":246,"tn_w":107,"tn_h":125,"tim":1491727326501,"time":1491727326,"md5":"UpWknOdJBWNcNfBs0CeUdw==","fsize":9209,"resto":120257119,"id":"HfrTOJJ6","country":"US","country_name":"United States"}]}

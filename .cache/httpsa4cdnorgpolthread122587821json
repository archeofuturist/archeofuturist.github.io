The one between the people and the monarch (see Magna Carta). The one between people and parliament. And the one between the monarch and parliament. If the monarchy is strong, then the monarch can protect the rights established through the first contract via the third. If the parliament is just, then the parliament can run the affairs of the country without the monarch. If both keep to their place, then the people don&#039;t lynch them both. It&#039;s a balancing act, wherein essentially the democratic government can govern via the will of the people, but (((outside interests))) cannot come in and sponsor movements and people which they can control under the illusion of freedom. The monarchy retains its place due to the land that it owns, and the monarch cannot really become invisible due to the role. What is happening now is that monarchs are becoming celebrity figures based on an economic argument.

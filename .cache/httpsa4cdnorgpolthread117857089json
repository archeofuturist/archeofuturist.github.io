Autism and the inability to connect with other people, which we can assume would make them virgins. Clearly virginity has some link to mass shootings, and is a major red flag that a person can&#039;t interact with other people normally.<br><br>I propose we create a watchlist for male virgins over the age of 21, through a process of extreme vetting. We need to protect our nation against these terrorists who strike on our own soil. These parasites need to be weeded out in our quest to make America great again.<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;The taciturn Cho Seung-Hui was so lonely he made up an \u201cimaginary girlfriend\u201d named \u201cJelly,\u201d according to two male students who shared a dormitory suite with him.

In contradistinction to these approaches, neuropsychiatric concepts and methods have received relatively little attention in this area. In this article we adopt a neuropsychiatric developmental perspective and undertake a review of the psychiatric literature on violence and autism spectrum disorders. Our analysis of this literature suggests the presence of an association between autism spectrum psychopathology and serial homicidal behavior. Recommendations for further research to help clarify the nature of this association are briefly discussed.<\/span><br>https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed<wbr>\/15568202","time":1490229591,"resto":117857089,"id":"M\/UxQJkA","country":"US","country_name":"United States"}]}

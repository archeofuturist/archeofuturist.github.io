It is theoretically based on the interpretation of a community as an organic body. The term corporatism is based on the Latin root word &quot;corpus&quot; (plural \u2013 &quot;corpora&quot;) meaning &quot;body&quot;.<\/span><br> <br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;In 1881, Pope Leo XIII commissioned theologians and social thinkers to study corporatism and provide a definition for it. In 1884 in Freiburg, the commission declared that corporatism was a &quot;system of social organization that has at its base the grouping of men according to the community of their natural interests and social functions, and as true and proper organs of the state they direct and coordinate labor and capital in matters of common interest&quot;.<\/span><br> <br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Corporatism developed in the 19th century as a response to Classical Liberalism and Marxism.<\/span><br> <br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;The basis of corporatism is to provide rights to the middle and working class to secure cooperation among the classes, and to prevent class conflict.<\/span>","time":1493683236,"resto":123690791,"id":"kGKcugER","country":"US","country_name":"United

I was having an extremely bad couple days, and I was seriously considering having a personal DotR the next day, to put it bluntly. To try to get my mind off that line of thinking, I decided to play some modded Grim Dawn (ironically a game where you start by surviving being hanged). In this mod, the number of classes was bumped up to 30, and (same as the base game) you get to dual-class, so I decided to let an online dice roller I&#039;ve used for \/tg\/ stuff pick what 2 classes I&#039;d mix. I rolled a 1 (Soldier, a base game class), and 30 (Mercenary, one of two modded class slots that are apparently changed by the mod dev on occasion). That alone was a bit odd, but I picked my classes, and then went to see what that somewhat redundant class combo was named. See, when you pick your second class, your class on your stat screen changes to reflect the combo, for example &quot;Necromancer&quot; and &quot;Arch Necromancer&quot; becomes &quot;Demi Lich&quot;. I figured it&#039;d be something like &quot;Weapon Master&quot;, &quot;Man at Arms&quot;, or even a coy reference like &quot;Ultimate Warrior&quot;, but nope... It was &quot;Billy Badass&quot;... And that made me laugh, hard, when laughing was the last thing I ever expected to do again. I spent a good chunk of the rest of the night sperging out and checking the class combos after that, and when I woke up the next morning, Rockefeller was dead, Soros is being investigated, the wiretaps were reconfirmed, and the world seemed a lot brighter. I know a lot of you will call me a fag, and tell me to kms, but I couldn&#039;t let this go untold. I believe with all my heart that Kek saved my life through randomized numbers.","filename":"IMAG0009","ext":".jpg","w":3264,"h":1840,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":140,"tim":1490219566864,"time":1490219566,"md5":"wSKCKSH\/lP9NDQWxLeWuLg==","fsize":2117726,"resto":0,"id":"GVyPvgUF","country":"US","m_img":1,"bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"i-have-an-experience-to-share-pol-i-think-kek","country_name":"United States","replies":3,"images":0,"unique_ips":2},{"no":117834121,"now":"03\/22\/17(Wed)17:56:33","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p117833483\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;117833483<\/a><br>weird<br>it&#039;s good you&#039;re okay now though, buddy","time":1490219793,"resto":117833483,"id":"p6zjl3tb","country":"CA","country_name":"Canada"},{"no":117836103,"now":"03\/22\/17(Wed)18:09:26","name":"Anonymous","com":"we&#039;re all gonna make it bros :^)","time":1490220566,"resto":117833483,"id":"p6zjl3tb","country":"CA","country_name":"Canada"},{"no":117836373,"now":"03\/22\/17(Wed)18:11:12","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p117834121\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;117834121<\/a><br>For once, you ARE my buddy, guy.","time":1490220672,"resto":117833483,"id":"GVyPvgUF","country":"US","country_name":"United States"}]}

I just graduated from HS last spring, and while I did performing arts and was stuck with all the faggots, there were a lot of kids my age and younger who didn&#039;t fall for the bullshit. Even now, my sister talks a lot about how most of her friends, including her, like Trump or are at the least open to his message, and we live in one of the bluest of blue states. Obviously anecdotal, but for any younger anons here, think of people around your age or younger, and their views on political issues; many of them are right wing, or at the very least, open to ideas of the right and could be persuaded that way.<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;What&#039;s the problem?<\/span><br>As good as this is, there is a major roadblock ahead of us in the generational battle. The majority outlook on life these days, especially where I&#039;m from, is that going to college is necessary to have further success in life. However, as we all know, college is a leftist breeding ground, and in many cases has become so expensive as to become a scam. Kids enter college as freshmen with a reasonably normal outlook on life, and graduate having spent years being pumped with leftist slogans of white guilt, queer theory, women&#039;s studies (required courses in some majors these days), and other assorted subversive leftist garbage. I don&#039;t have concrete evidence, but I bet if you did a survey of the colored hair types at a given college, they probably skew more toward upperclassmen than freshman. In short, the modern collegiate experience infects the young and turns them into leftist drones.<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;What&#039;s the solution? <\/span><br>We should start a campaign to bring trades back to prominence. There&#039;s a stigma, especially around the young, that brings a tradesman is work that&#039;s beneath them, that it&#039;s worthless, and that they deserve better. In fact, trades are none of those things. They are necessary, to maintain infrastructure, they provide an honest living, and it can be extremely rewarding (continued in part two, below)","filename":"IMG_6029","ext":".jpg","w":1980,"h":900,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":113,"tim":1491329199274,"time":1491329199,"md5":"LBmOvfTuJVfgIIdmuc9k\/w==","fsize":268810,"resto":0,"id":"0ePEEH3x","country":"US","m_img":1,"bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"the-generation-z-meme-is-real-mostly-i-just","country_name":"United States","replies":49,"images":5,"unique_ips":23},{"no":119496024,"now":"04\/04\/17(Tue)14:07:29","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119495918\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119495918<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;The Generation Z meme is real, mostly<\/span><br>Stopped reading","time":1491329249,"resto":119495918,"id":"UL5aSIPk","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":119496218,"now":"04\/04\/17(Tue)14:09:20","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119495918\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119495918<\/a><br>to see your work come to fruition before your eyes, whether as a fixed pipe, a blueprint becoming a house, or a hunk of steel united to become a useful tool.

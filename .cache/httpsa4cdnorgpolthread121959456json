I&#039;ve come here from r\/politics to debate with you the virtues of modern socialism. I will try my best to answer reasonable questions and will ignore obvious trolling. I would encourage you to debate us on reddit but the userbase here seems averse to leaving it&#039;s hugbox and judging by a quick glance at the lowbrow content posted here, the average user probably wouldn&#039;t meet community standards. I would love to keep our discussion light and somewhat informal, but please refrain from using profanity as I frown upon distasteful discourse.","time":1492667198,"resto":121959456,"id":"uBt\/iYZn","country":"AU","country_name":"Australia"}]}

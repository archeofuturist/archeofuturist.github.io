Everyone who doesn&#039;t lick boots is a shill, everyone who fully supports trump is a plebbitor. How can we get back to rational discourse and logical thought processes in threads?

At our roots we are all fiercely critical of the global Jew, but their agenda is being pushed harder than ever while we stand by and flame each other.

Stay inside and risk dying when the house crumbles, or run to the nearest shelter which is like 200 meters away?<br><br>Once in the shelter it should be fine, but I have trouble evaluating the higher risk need to run there against staying at home.<br><br>Also, I&#039;ll have to run with my baby (12 kg) and a survival backpack (5-10 kg).<br><br>Please stop shitposting for a minute and give me your opinions.","filename":"1472139233541","ext":".png","w":1920,"h":1080,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":140,"tim":1493191032879,"time":1493191032,"md5":"RPB1BIwxbREociKVvfOW+A==","fsize":1547120,"resto":0,"id":"XI6bPQn2","country":"KR","m_img":1,"bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"best-way-stay-alive-in-seoul","country_name":"South Korea","replies":5,"images":0,"unique_ips":6},{"no":122857652,"now":"04\/26\/17(Wed)03:18:22","name":"Anonymous","com":"<span class=\"quote\">&gt;baby<\/span><br><br>race traitor","time":1493191102,"resto":122857563,"id":"xXzllE0l","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":122858034,"now":"04\/26\/17(Wed)03:24:21","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122857563\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122857563<\/a><br>Bitch see flag related,a new hard earthquake could hit my country any minute since its been more than 50 years since the last one and the tectonic plates will slide eventually.I live in the capital of said shithole where commie blocks are old as fuck.<br>They said that its over 7 richter scahle 30000 at least will die if its over 8....heh not many will survive.The government is a corrupt piece of shit so they will not consolidate or bulid better buildings.<br>If i get caught inder the rubble i will probaly bash my head against something since there is no way someone will pull me out.<br><br><br>Finally my advice when the bombs start to fall do what i would in the same situation crouch away from the windows,put your head between your legs and pray to whatever the fuck you belive in.If you somehow survive then whait till the shelling\/bombing run is over then you can worry if you will make it to any shelter.","time":1493191461,"resto":122857563,"id":"Abj1tkGj","country":"RO","country_name":"Romania"},{"no":122858160,"now":"04\/26\/17(Wed)03:25:50","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122857563\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122857563<\/a><br>your own fault for breeding with asians","time":1493191550,"resto":122857563,"id":"FXROTsw3","country":"PL","country_name":"Poland"},{"no":122858164,"now":"04\/26\/17(Wed)03:25:51","name":"Anonymous","com":"Is it possible to leave your survival bag in the shelter?

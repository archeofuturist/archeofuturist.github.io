DPRK will not preemptively attack Seoul.<br>Primary targets will have to be US military or critical to getting rid of US military. DPRK probably has its hands tied unless China and Russia decide to team up and push the United States out of the Korean peninsula. There is literally no reason to worry about Seoul getting shelled before a US carrier is sunk or a US base is destroyed. The biggest problem for Seoul would be Russian tanks followed by KJN demanding Americans and pals to be sent off to gulags.<br>I would be so much more worried if I lived literally on the border, near a military base\/port, followed by maybe \uae40\ud3ec to \ud0dc\uc548. I&#039;m not expert on this shit, but just use your fucking heads. The likelyhood of SK getting smacked are well below China, the US, Korea, and Russia going in and splitting up DPRK.","time":1493203065,"resto":122857563,"id":"1JBCe3a3","country":"KR","country_name":"South Korea"},{"no":122870418,"now":"04\/26\/17(Wed)06:44:17","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122869958\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122869958<\/a><br>Just be prepared.

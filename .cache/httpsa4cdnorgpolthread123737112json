Nothing horrible is going to happen. People just stop using their cars on their own and find other solutions slowly during the price-hike. Leftists just spout their usual doomsday bullshit and try to force alternate energy sources onto people before the natural infrastructure change has taken place. So no doesn&#039;t concern.

Maybe there&#039;s a climatologist in here who can explain it. Okay, the Earth and the environment it supports is basically a closed system. Over billions of years, some of our atmosphere has bled off into space a girrilon tons of space rocks have fallen to earth, but basically all the carbon atoms there are on the planet are roughly the same as what there was when the planet coalesced from a cloud of gas. So, at one time, a lot of the carbon was free in the environment. The earth had a nice warm environment for critters to roam around in. Then plants began trapping carbon in.their tissues as part of their metabolic process. Over time, a lot of that plant life was buried and preserved. Some turned to coal, some turned to oil. So, if we burned up every drop of oil and chunk of coal, how could this lead to a catastrophe when it would essentially return the Earth to the climate enjoyed by the dinosaurs.","time":1493724809,"resto":123737112,"id":"G+YYdaYu","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":123758264,"now":"05\/02\/17(Tue)07:35:12","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123745855\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123745855<\/a><br>Didn&#039;t have to be big corpses, just lots of them.

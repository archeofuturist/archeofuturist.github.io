I don&#039;t know if I believe him, honestly, but there is also a Bohemian Club (like secret country club, but in the city) in San Francisco. It is all very Masonic, and lots of professors here apparently buy into it. I would imagine there is lots of pedophilia and crowley shit too, but its all modernized and in more of a grey area now, so its like a 15 year old twink that mayors usually get caught with (see portland, and others) but yea honestly there is some real satanist shit in Berkeley as well as Oakland and San Francisco. I think it is over 100 year olds, like from the rail road tycoon era, they were all masons, hearst family, all the families that built UC Berkeley are basically freemason or other secret society types, whether Jew, Crypto-Jew, or Gentile. Sooo many Jews on campus as well as in the city of Berkeley, but they&#039;re all generally crypto-Jews and atheist Jews. But then there are of course a few orthodox and the pro-israel students that lobby on sproul. Berkeley is satanic ZOG is my point.","time":1492799045,"resto":122162097,"id":"yfpBa6Vu","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":122166255,"now":"04\/21\/17(Fri)14:26:49","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122162463\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122162463<\/a><br>Good to know!","time":1492799209,"resto":122162097,"id":"+vowilX9","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":122166532,"now":"04\/21\/17(Fri)14:29:10","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122165928\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122165928<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Masons<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;pedophiles<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Crowley<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Satanists<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Hearst family<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Jews\/ZOG<\/span><br><br>This has to be some kind of BINGO","filename":"foilup","ext":".jpg","w":623,"h":413,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":82,"tim":1492799350137,"time":1492799350,"md5":"T13xea\/XbzdhOBSQnep05w==","fsize":51949,"resto":122162097,"id":"lwNM2tSI","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":122167547,"now":"04\/21\/17(Fri)14:37:45","name":"Anonymous","com":"https:\/\/mobile.twitter.com\/JesseArr<wbr>eguin<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Honored to welcome newly sworn-in @BerkeleyPDChief Andrew Greenwood.

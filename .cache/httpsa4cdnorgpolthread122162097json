I think it is over 100 year olds, like from the rail road tycoon era, they were all masons, hearst family, all the families that built UC Berkeley are basically freemason or other secret society types, whether Jew, Crypto-Jew, or Gentile. Sooo many Jews on campus as well as in the city of Berkeley, but they&#039;re all generally crypto-Jews and atheist Jews.

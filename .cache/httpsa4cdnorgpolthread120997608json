So many of these retards think a degree entitles you to a job. I dated a girl a while back who was a theater major who had 70k in debt and was only in her sophomore year. She whimsically went to a college 500 miles from home for a year, then transfered to another college for her sophomore year. She was somehow able to charge all the moving and living expenses onto her student debt. <br><br>I think I&#039;m going to look her up and see what she&#039;s up to now.","time":1492139563,"resto":120997608,"id":"itILhj+d","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":121009844,"now":"04\/13\/17(Thu)23:13:03","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120997672\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120997672<\/a><br>fpbp","time":1492139583,"resto":120997608,"id":"6aPfMMIB","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":121009952,"now":"04\/13\/17(Thu)23:14:04","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120997672\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120997672<\/a><br><br>fpbp","time":1492139644,"resto":120997608,"id":"MTpw5T2F","country":"CA","country_name":"Canada"},{"no":121010097,"now":"04\/13\/17(Thu)23:15:25","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121005766\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121005766<\/a><br>LOVE WINS (while we maintain dominance, after which your grandchildren will be raped to death by roving bands of niggers)","time":1492139725,"resto":120997608,"id":"txDBCUSF","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":121010134,"now":"04\/13\/17(Thu)23:15:40","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120997608\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120997608<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;they blame all their failures on minorities and undocumented immigrants <\/span><br>No, they just hate them <br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;reddit liberal intellectuals<\/span><br>FUCKING KEK <br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;multicultural society<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;build robots<\/span><br>When have shitskins EVER built a robot?","time":1492139740,"resto":120997608,"id":"XVgDPBeu","country":"RS","country_name":"Serbia"},{"no":121010178,"now":"04\/13\/17(Thu)23:16:04","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121005766\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121005766<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;http:\/\/jasss.soc.surrey.ac.uk\/16\/3<wbr>\/7.html#dudleyfile2007<\/span><br>This is excellent.

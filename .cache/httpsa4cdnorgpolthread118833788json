There was no shortage of food or water or nesting material. There were no predators.<br><br>The last surviving birth was on day 600, bringing the total population to a mere 2200 mice... This period between day 315 and day 600 saw a breakdown in social structure and in normal social behavior. Among the aberrations in behavior were the following: expulsion of young before weaning was complete, wounding of young, increase in homosexual behavior, inability of dominant males to maintain the defense of their territory and females, aggressive behavior of females, passivity of non-dominant males with increased attacks on each other which were not defended against. After day 600, the social breakdown continued and the population declined toward extinction. Their male counterparts withdrew completely, never engaging in courtship or fighting. They ate, drank, slept, and groomed themselves \u2013 all solitary pursuits. Sleek, healthy coats and an absence of scars characterized these males. They were dubbed &quot;the beautiful ones.&quot; Breeding never resumed and behavior patterns were permanently changed.<br><br>...when all available space is taken and all social roles filled, competition and the stresses experienced by the individuals will result in a total breakdown in complex social behaviors, ultimately resulting in the demise of the population.<br><br>Calhoun saw the fate of the population of mice as a metaphor for the potential fate of man. He characterized the social breakdown as a &quot;second death,\u201d with reference to the \u201csecond death\u201d mentioned in the Biblical book of Revelation 2:11.

The principal took them aside and told them &quot;You&#039;re not doing me any favors by sticking around. Why don&#039;t you head down the road and see if Ford is hiring.&quot; And most of the time, Ford *was* hiring, at wages that would allow you to support a wife and kids. Once that fell into place, there was some serious social pressure to get married and have kids, preferably by your mid-twenties at the very latest.

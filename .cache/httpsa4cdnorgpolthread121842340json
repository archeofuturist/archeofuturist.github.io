The one screaming, &quot;Islam is not a religion of peace!&quot; and &quot;Sadiq Khan lied to us!&quot; and other slurs I dare not mention. Tread lightly.<br>You are one. We are hundreds, thousands. Millions. You aren&#039;t just IN the minority; you ARE the minority.<br>I don&#039;t feel awkward or anxious being a Muslim around others, and your words don&#039;t affect me. Many others, however, are coming out of their shells for the first time in their lives. This is the first time many are enjoying the beautiful world that has been gifted to us by Allah - and it IS beautiful. Incredibly so. DON&#039;T ruin this for them. We Muslims may have our differences, but we will not hesitate to come to the aid of our fellow Athiests, especially against someone who so virulently slurs that which has brought us all together.<br>Don&#039;t take this the wrong way. I don&#039;t hate you. I don&#039;t fear you. I pity you.<br>I&#039;m sorry that you feel this way towards us. I&#039;m sorry that Islam is such a bane to your existence. And I&#039;m sorry that you are missing out on such a wonderful religion. Mostly, though, I&#039;m sorry that you feel the need to go around and publicly chastise and berate others. I&#039;m sorry that, to ensure your own validity, you need to make others feel invalid. I&#039;m sorry that your self-worth is so infinitesimally miniscule that you have to make others feel less-than-human, at least in your own denatured mind, just to feel whole. I am truly sorry that day-in and day-out you have to put up with your worthless, meaningless, Shakespearean tragedy of a life.<br>I ask you politely to cease your unnecessary cries for attention, and instead invite you to join our ranks. Stop being a Christian, convert to Islam, and breathe in the splendour and the amazement of your first mosque, and then, maybe, just maybe, you&#039;ll see what you&#039;ve been so hopelessly searching for this whole time.","filename":"muslim","ext":".jpg","w":225,"h":225,"tn_w":225,"tn_h":225,"tim":1492607572690,"time":1492607572,"md5":"FEEcX4fUuEXyZ\/5ZhXU79g==","fsize":7349,"resto":0,"id":"fzWizk5v","country":"GB","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"you","country_name":"United Kingdom","replies":1,"images":0,"unique_ips":2},{"no":121842466,"now":"04\/19\/17(Wed)09:14:04","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121842340\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121842340<\/a><br>Is this pasta?

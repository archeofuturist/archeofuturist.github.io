We decided to play Mario Kart together, we&#039;ve been doing that since I was 5 and it&#039;s always brings back nostalgic memories. When it was time for Colbert to start he shut off the game and we both sat there to watch it together. He always told me how cool Colbert was and how he would &quot;stick it&quot; to the right harder than anyone else. My Uncle hates Trump because Trump is a Russian spy, so he really likes to laugh at Trump jokes. Anyway, Colbert made that joke and my Uncle actually just got off the couch and ran out of the room. I walked around the house for about 15 minutes shouting his name until I heard some sobbing coming from the bathroom. My uncle had locked himself in the bathroom and was bawling his eyes out. We had a long talk from behind the door about how some people aren&#039;t what they seem and when something happens like Trump getting elected people tend to let their worst self out. It was hard for us to realize this, but now we are dedicated to getting rid Colbert. It&#039;s important that younger, more vulnerable, homosexual youth don&#039;t somehow learn that this is ok. It&#039;s important that we make a point that no matter who you are or what your standing may be with the LGBTQ community you don&#039;t get to make jokes like that.

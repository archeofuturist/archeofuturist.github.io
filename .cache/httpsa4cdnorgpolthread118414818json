Classical music education would encourage white children to have pride in their European heritage, increases IQ, and would protect them from degenerate pop music which is hollow when compared to the full richness of classical music. It also teaches children the importance of discipline. The cultural Marxists know that classical music poses a threat to their agenda,which is why for decades, they&#039;ve been trying to paint classical music as an elitist anachronistic hobby for old white men whilst pushing degenerate pop for children.","filename":"44FBAE29-94B5-4513-8A7A-6CE628A79C57-195-0000008C5435187E","ext":".jpg","w":332,"h":443,"tn_w":187,"tn_h":250,"tim":1490562137199,"time":1490562137,"md5":"SaXqXKMOfj4lzZarWnwxRg==","fsize":26389,"resto":0,"id":"+sS498N9","country":"AU","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"how-do-we-get-more-white-children-interested-in","country_name":"Australia","replies":1,"images":0,"unique_ips":2},{"no":118416911,"now":"03\/26\/17(Sun)17:16:55","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118414818\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118414818<\/a><br>We&#039;re pretty good about this in Frane.

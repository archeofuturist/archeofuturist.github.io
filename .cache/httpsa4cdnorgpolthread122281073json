Should i stop writing and go kill someone now ? Science is about producing propositions, testing them and release to public. The only thing that matters are the facts, the explanation and the tests. And not how long someone has study in this field. Therefore it should be possible for any person to read and test for himself. and if the person sees a flaw in the proposition and\/ or testes point that out. The problem for me is called projection. We desperately need to find human like thought in other stuff, but sometime there is none. This explains why we look for ayy lmaos, and why are old ladies treating their dogs like literal children. They are animals behaving by conditioning mixed with pack behaviour stated by their DNA. Sorry but dogs do not love, that is just our projection. I do that myself i own a dog and its even therapeutic to project that way, its easyer when they never say no.","filename":"babyDog","ext":".jpg","w":597,"h":590,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":123,"tim":1492873322816,"time":1492873322,"md5":"MGd4VF\/rM0GxIYPvFnApeQ==","fsize":118288,"resto":122281073,"id":"zHidckOs","country":"BR","country_name":"Brazil"},{"no":122285664,"now":"04\/22\/17(Sat)11:03:13","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122281073\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122281073<\/a><br>If dolphins are so smart how come they wuz never kangs?","time":1492873393,"resto":122281073,"id":"hhNvqrA2","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":122285889,"now":"04\/22\/17(Sat)11:05:24","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122281220\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122281220<\/a><br><a href=\"#p122282450\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122282450<\/a><br><a href=\"#p122282102\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122282102<\/a>","filename":"klghj56j7","ext":".jpg","w":873,"h":960,"tn_w":113,"tn_h":125,"tim":1492873524327,"time":1492873524,"md5":"kFHiAGZmRxg4PllNutyqhA==","fsize":109142,"resto":122281073,"id":"Cuy5zHlw","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":122286687,"now":"04\/22\/17(Sat)11:12:49","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122285889\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122285889<\/a><br><a href=\"#p122281073\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122281073<\/a><br><br>thats fucking gross","time":1492873969,"resto":122281073,"id":"Kx6+vlld","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":122287115,"now":"04\/22\/17(Sat)11:16:43","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122286687\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122286687<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Ywn be forced into odd outlandish positions while she wrestles you<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Ywn have your face forced into every one of her sweaty crevices<\/span><br><br>Why even live \/pol\/?","filename":"1440524464910","ext":".jpg","w":456,"h":320,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":87,"tim":1492874203878,"time":1492874203,"md5":"TussJ7WtAMbjEZc+tyqNkA==","fsize":32089,"resto":122281073,"id":"52LTVovc","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":122287137,"now":"04\/22\/17(Sat)11:16:53","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122281529\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122281529<\/a><br>LOO","time":1492874213,"resto":122281073,"id":"W3BjrVK5","country":"NL","country_name":"Netherlands"},{"no":122287253,"now":"04\/22\/17(Sat)11:17:51","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122281073\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122281073<\/a><br>How does this make you feel landlubbers?","filename":"Soon","ext":".jpg","w":600,"h":600,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":125,"tim":1492874271291,"time":1492874271,"md5":"2kjorua8lxHjrDdvxtE1vA==","fsize":52438,"resto":122281073,"id":"NJAj+p+Z","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":122287465,"now":"04\/22\/17(Sat)11:19:53","name":"Anonymous","com":"Anyone else think its a real shame that dolphins lack opposable thumbs?

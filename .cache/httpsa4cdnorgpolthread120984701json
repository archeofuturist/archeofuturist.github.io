These are the dead suns and other large aggregations of matter devoid of light and heat. The dark islands are sometimes enormous in mass and exert a powerful influence in universe equilibrium and energy manipulation. The density of some of these large masses is well-nigh unbelievable. And this great concentration of mass enables these dark islands to function as powerful balance wheels, holding large neighboring systems in effective leash. They hold the gravity balance of power in many constellations; many physical systems which would otherwise speedily dive to destruction in near-by suns are held securely in the gravity grasp of these guardian dark islands. It is because of this function that we can locate them accurately. We have measured the gravity pull of the luminous bodies, and we can therefore calculate the exact size and location of the dark islands of space which so effectively function to hold a given system steady in its course.","time":1492135435,"resto":120984701,"id":"Ey2P8oxq","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":121001896,"now":"04\/13\/17(Thu)22:04:02","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121001635\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121001635<\/a><br>There are a lot of traditions and sects.

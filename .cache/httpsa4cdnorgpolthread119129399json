In 2014, 58% said this was true.<\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;That\u2019s according to sociologists Joanna Pepin of the University of Maryland and David Cotter of Union College, who examined almost 40 years of surveys taken by American high-school seniors. They found that millennials (those born between 1982 and the early 2000s), have a surprising set of views on gender.<\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Separate research looking at the General Social Survey (which has reported on the same questions for 40 years and breaks the answers down by age) bolsters these findings. It found that in 1994, 16% of young American adults (aged 18-25) believed that a woman\u2019s place was in the home. By 2014, that figure had risen to 25%.<\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Cotter says that if the trend continues, the gender revolution\u2014which was already stalling by metrics of of female labor force participation and the pace of closing the gender pay gap \u2014will slow even more dramatically.<\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;\u201cIf they persist with these attitudes, they are not likely to be pushing for organizational or societal changes in those family arrangements,\u201d he said.<\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;The change in responses to the General Social Survey was even more dramatic: In 1994, 83% of young men rejected the notion that the model family has a male breadwinner. A decade later, that figure dropped to 55%. Female support for the male breadwinner model rose in kind. In 1994, 15% of young women agreed that the male-breadwinner model was superior; by 2014, 28% preferred it.<\/span><br>Say it with me \/pol\/<br>PENDULUM SWING","filename":"atlas_SyhYD4F3x@2x[1]","ext":".png","w":1288,"h":736,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":142,"tim":1491011732168,"time":1491011732,"md5":"3Bdgg0lWoqmfwGUL7dC5yw==","fsize":25318,"resto":0,"id":"nWsE6S0D","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"american-millenials-more-likely-to-say-a-womans","country_name":"United States","replies":1,"images":1,"unique_ips":2},{"no":119129785,"now":"03\/31\/17(Fri)21:59:32","name":"Anonymous","com":"that&#039;s because the 3rd worlders who migrated in the last 50 years into America should stab you in the face for a piece of chicken. they also like to use women as human punching bags.<br>56% and going down.","filename":"nu-pol","ext":".jpg","w":2452,"h":2839,"tn_w":107,"tn_h":125,"tim":1491011972276,"time":1491011972,"md5":"WH2GsiJ0CAOhh0+zndJzag==","fsize":805475,"resto":119129399,"id":"aqsPpX+b","country":"RO","m_img":1,"country_name":"Romania"}]}

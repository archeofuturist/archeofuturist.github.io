How would they go about doing this? <br><br>Well first off let&#039;s assume that Trump and the Zionists who control the main positions in the house and senate are working together with Israel and the Chinese to carry out a &quot;Russian&quot; False Flag terrorist attack. <br><br>This gives Trump legitimate justification to declare a state of emergency so (((they))) can round up &#039;political dissidents&#039; - who will simply be described as &#039;Russian conspirators&#039; by the MSM. <br><br>Anyone who questions this narrative on (((CNN\/Fox\/MSNBC\/New York times))) will be labelled a potential suspect - including right wing politicians, right wing media pundits, and right wing academics, who will be brought into custody for &#039;further questioning&#039; for having &#039;Russian sympathies&#039;.<br><br>This would soon be followed by &#039;CIA\/Mossad operatives instructed by Trump and Kushner to carry out assassinations of high level military targets who pose a threat to the new regime.

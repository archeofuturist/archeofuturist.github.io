This is achieved by general movement during the day.<br>But at night you&#039;re not moving as much, and the toxins will build up in your muscles because they still have to do basic stuff to live. So getting out of bed and then immediately sitting down for breakfast will result in a slugish, toxified state for hours (and will be doing harm to your body by placing it under overload stress).<br>Heavy exercise in the morning isn&#039;t the answer either, as you are just upping the toxic load by overworking your muscles.<br>Ten minutes gentle stretching will freshen the body and mind, invigorating you for the entire day and resulting in a more productive and awake life.<br>Try it.","time":1490871272,"resto":118906387,"id":"p352xfj9","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":118910426,"now":"03\/30\/17(Thu)07:00:35","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118909235\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118909235<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;glutehole stick <\/span><br><br>fucking kek","filename":"TopkekGerman","ext":".jpg","w":750,"h":390,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":65,"tim":1490871635640,"time":1490871635,"md5":"GgU5a5AZhdxeclbbrqvv7Q==","fsize":78418,"resto":118906387,"id":"x9g4L4Hx","country":"DE","country_name":"Germany"},{"no":118911247,"now":"03\/30\/17(Thu)07:13:34","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118906387\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118906387<\/a><br><a href=\"#p118910086\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118910086<\/a><br><br>LURKING FOR MOAR<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;lifting<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;have mostly sitting job<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;stiff muscles<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;rounded shoulders<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;trying to improove posture<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;thinking about doing yoga (for stretches n shieeeet)<\/span>","time":1490872414,"resto":118906387,"id":"FD+oxFc9","country":"HU","country_name":"Hungary"},{"no":118911661,"now":"03\/30\/17(Thu)07:20:56","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118911247\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118911247<\/a><br>Yoga is good for core trength, and it will give you a suitable early morning routine.

He promised that MORE people would be insured AND he problem a with the ACA would be gone.<br>Anybody with a brain cells knows this is impossible. The entire problem with the ACA is that because 20 million people can&#039;t afford health care, literally EVERYONE ELSE has to have their premiums skyrocket to pay for them. There. Is. No. Way. To. Keep. Those. People. Insured. And. Have. Premiums. Drop. Period. <br><br>Trump should have been honest. He should we were just trying to repeal.

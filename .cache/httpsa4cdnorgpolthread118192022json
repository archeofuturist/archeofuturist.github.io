If you have practically no income and a lot of health problems then Obamacare is basically free healthcare. The trouble is, in order to pay for all that, insurers have to charge ridiculously high premiums to people who have fewer health care needs, and if you actually make a decent income you don&#039;t qualify for any government gibs and have to pay for it yourself. It also requires all insurance plans to provide services like pediatric care and maternity services that not everyone needs, which is another reason premiums are so high. <br><br>In order to ensure that people sign up, there is a tax penalty you get slapped with every year if you don&#039;t have insurance. However, for a lot of people, the tax penalty is actually cheaper than the insurance, particularly since the insurance plans aren&#039;t that great in the first place. The one I had to buy a couple years ago, for instance, had a $5000 YEARLY deductible, which there was no way in hell I would ever meet. So basically, I was paying for insurance every month, and if I had to go to the doctor it still cost as much as it would if I had no insurance.<br><br>Meanwhile, DaQwanda and her 8 little baby Trayvons get free doctor visits, free meds, free everything on top of the mountain of free shit they already get.

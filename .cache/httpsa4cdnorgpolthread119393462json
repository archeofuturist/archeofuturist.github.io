Not only are opposing ideas struck down with government force, they also claim the moral high ground. To this I have two objections:<br><br>1. It&#039;s not efficient to have such stringent policy of freedom of expression.<br> From a completely utilitarian aspect, rational discussion and debate end up showing which of the ideas in the debate are more true or logical. With this, not only do both parties walk away with more knowledge, but the people who heard this debate walk away with it as well. There is also the issue of conviction. In a society like a theocratic one or fascist or communist, any opposing idea is usually violently shut down at first glance. This leads to an issue where those who once regularly defended their idea have nothing to hone their skills of defending and promoting their idea and it thus, over time, becomes more and more susceptible to another idea overtaking it.","filename":"Disdain for Plebs","ext":".jpg","w":400,"h":462,"tn_w":108,"tn_h":125,"tim":1491261879224,"time":1491261879,"md5":"FnjhWSCCLNIcCc4362KxNg==","fsize":26201,"resto":119393462,"id":"UAlFDacD","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":119397239,"now":"04\/03\/17(Mon)19:25:01","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119397189\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119397189<\/a><br>2. It is simply not good for the soul<br> Although this is specifically aimed at hardcore religious life, it can be said that the ideologies of fascism and communism become the religions of its adherents. The strict goals and lifestyle of a certain religion is much like a mold for human character. In this theocratic society, there are only a few molds, but usually many kinds of men. The soul is not like a machine that comes in makes and models, it is more like a tree that grows at its own whim according to its will. Thus, trapping the soul into one of these molds of theocratic society is not only restricting to the person\u2019s real life, but it is an attack on the very soul of a man whose ideas don\u2019t align perfectly with the prevailing opinion, in this case Islam. <br><br>Collectivism and the group think that comes with it is garbage and Individualism is the only true way.

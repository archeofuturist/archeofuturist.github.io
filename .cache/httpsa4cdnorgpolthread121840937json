The numbers:<br><br>Le Pen - 25%<br>Melenchon - 21.7%<br>Macron - 21.0%<br>Fillon - 20.2%<br>Hamon - 5.2%<br><br>Shut up an trust me on that. I will be right. Le Pen historically always overperforms her polls unless there is another credible right wing candidate for her votes to go to. There isn&#039;t. I have used a variety of other methods to calculate the other numbers; to be very brief, always remember that Macron&#039;s base is FRAGILE (1\/3 of voters could change minds) and is attracted to Melenchon&#039;s base, where as Fillon has stalled because of Penelopegate, and there is no reason to vote for Hamon as Melenchon becomes the candidate for the Left. <br><br>2nd Round will be 51.43% for Le Pen and 48.51% for Melenchon. Polls after the first round will show roughly a 54\/46 race, favouring Melenchon. <br><br>The crucial moment will come when Fillon ENDORSES Le Pen (or several prominent members of his party). Why would he\/they do that, you ask? Because they support Le Pen AGAINST the commie Melenchon (he wants 100% tax on rich). ALSO, they will have a parliamentary majority, and want to get shit done. THEY CAN GET SHIT DONE WITH LE PEN, BUT NOT WITH MELENCHON. This is crucial to remember.<br><br>This will be the FINAL BLOW. Currently (((polls))) predict the abstention rates of Fillon supporters in a 2nd round Le Pen\/Melenchon to be approximately 50%. (i.e. 50% do not vote at all). Fillon\/his party&#039;s endorsement of Le Pen will reduce this rate to approximately 30%, which results in the 51.43% victory I described above. So, add all these factors in and Le Pen will Make France Great Again. I&#039;m waiting, \/pol\/. Shortly, you will see that I was right.","filename":"Capture","ext":".png","w":401,"h":407,"tn_w":246,"tn_h":250,"tim":1492606689153,"time":1492606689,"md5":"bQ0kHM1zqVkIR2UL9YXz1Q==","fsize":216583,"resto":0,"id":"3SzxQ8AO","country":"AU","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"le-pen-will-win-guaranteed-2","country_name":"Australia","replies":170,"images":42,"unique_ips":64,"tail_size":50},{"no":121841145,"now":"04\/19\/17(Wed)09:00:22","name":"Anonymous","com":"First for Taleb","filename":"2017-04-19 15.00.15","ext":".png","w":612,"h":669,"tn_w":114,"tn_h":125,"tim":1492606822555,"time":1492606822,"md5":"KtOpNmF\/+OXyvmlfXSh3yQ==","fsize":381772,"resto":121840937,"id":"DE7rVbRt","country":"PL","country_name":"Poland"},{"no":121841282,"now":"04\/19\/17(Wed)09:01:57","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121841145\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121841145<\/a><br>She will win, as in the OP.

C&#039;est un fait. <br><br>The FN is ALWAYS underperforming in the polls. Partly because of media biais when selecting pollees (underestimating certain demographics, or the amount of misery in France at the moment), partly because voting FN is still somewhat of a taboo (i.e. A lot of people will vote for her but never admit it), and partly because this complete fuckery of an election cycle has made people actually believe turning the page of the 5th republic is possible. <br><br>Le Pen will come out first in the first round Sunday. I&#039;m still undecided about who she will face, but here are my estimates:<br><br>Against Melenchon: roughly 15% chance of happening, and if it does, Le Pen has 98% chance of winning the second round. Merluche is overrepresented, surfing on an inexistant dynamic. A lot of people declare voting for him to show extremism and being fed up by the system, but in secret will vote Le Pen. <br><br>Against Fillon: roughly 25% chance of happening. This is tricky. I sense a LOT of abstention, but Fillon might pull back in some FN votes that get cold feet. (I.e. &quot;Ok he&#039;s right wing enough&quot;). I sense Le Pen would win a second round, but barely. 60-40. <br><br>Against Macron: roughly 60% chance of happening. I fee Macron is a huge bubble that will pop open like an infected zit on election day, but he will still weasle through to the second round, barely. He is the most dangerous opponent, as his wishy washy stance gave him a fragile base, but also few enemies. He is the perfect goy picture boy for the Front Republicain anti FN alliance. This will be hard. I sense a tiny Le Pen victory, by only 1-3 percentage points. <br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;&gt;t.

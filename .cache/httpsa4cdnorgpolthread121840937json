The numbers:<br><br>Le Pen - 25%<br>Melenchon - 21.7%<br>Macron - 21.0%<br>Fillon - 20.2%<br>Hamon - 5.2%<br><br>Shut up an trust me on that. I will be right. Le Pen historically always overperforms her polls unless there is another credible right wing candidate for her votes to go to. There isn&#039;t. I have used a variety of other methods to calculate the other numbers; to be very brief, always remember that Macron&#039;s base is FRAGILE (1\/3 of voters could change minds) and is attracted to Melenchon&#039;s base, where as Fillon has stalled because of Penelopegate, and there is no reason to vote for Hamon as Melenchon becomes the candidate for the Left. <br><br>2nd Round will be 51.43% for Le Pen and 48.51% for Melenchon. Polls after the first round will show roughly a 54\/46 race, favouring Melenchon. <br><br>The crucial moment will come when Fillon ENDORSES Le Pen (or several prominent members of his party). Why would he\/they do that, you ask? Because they support Le Pen AGAINST the commie Melenchon (he wants 100% tax on rich). ALSO, they will have a parliamentary majority, and want to get shit done. THEY CAN GET SHIT DONE WITH LE PEN, BUT NOT WITH MELENCHON. This is crucial to remember.<br><br>This will be the FINAL BLOW. Currently (((polls))) predict the abstention rates of Fillon supporters in a 2nd round Le Pen\/Melenchon to be approximately 50%. (i.e. 50% do not vote at all). Fillon\/his party&#039;s endorsement of Le Pen will reduce this rate to approximately 30%, which results in the 51.43% victory I described above. So, add all these factors in and Le Pen will Make France Great Again. I&#039;m waiting, \/pol\/. Shortly, you will see that I was right.","filename":"Capture","ext":".png","w":401,"h":407,"tn_w":246,"tn_h":250,"tim":1492606689153,"time":1492606689,"md5":"bQ0kHM1zqVkIR2UL9YXz1Q==","fsize":216583,"resto":0,"id":"3SzxQ8AO","country":"AU","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"le-pen-will-win-guaranteed-2","country_name":"Australia","replies":12,"images":3,"unique_ips":6},{"no":121841145,"now":"04\/19\/17(Wed)09:00:22","name":"Anonymous","com":"First for Taleb","filename":"2017-04-19 15.00.15","ext":".png","w":612,"h":669,"tn_w":114,"tn_h":125,"tim":1492606822555,"time":1492606822,"md5":"KtOpNmF\/+OXyvmlfXSh3yQ==","fsize":381772,"resto":121840937,"id":"DE7rVbRt","country":"PL","country_name":"Poland"},{"no":121841282,"now":"04\/19\/17(Wed)09:01:57","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121841145\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121841145<\/a><br>She will win, as in the OP.

Melenchon will be decimated and politics in France will be more dysfunctional than ever. Who will be blamed? Melenchon, or the Republican majority? Both; with the lion&#039;s share of the blame being heaved on the Republicans because Melenchon will use his pulpit to put it on them, and it will be perceived that Melenchon won a &quot;mandate&quot; for his policies in May. <br><br>Fillon will be fucked. Melenchon will be fucked. The country will be fucked. Just look at what happened with the Labour Party in the Netherlands, how they were deserted by their base by having seen as succumbing to the centre right&#039;s policies in the coalition government. So if the Republicans go along with Melenchon at all, they will be even more fucked. In light of this, you cannot rule out an encouragement by the Republicans to vote AGAINST Melenchon in round two. Not FOR le pen. That is how they will frame it.","time":1492607419,"resto":121840937,"id":"3SzxQ8AO","country":"AU","country_name":"Australia"}]}

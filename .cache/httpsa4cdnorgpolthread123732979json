The only &quot;conspiracy theory&quot; I have about the moon landings and space program was that it was used as a cover for developing ICBM&#039;s. There is a laser reflector placed on the moon that you can see from earth if you use a telescope but I guess the autists will tell me it was just dropped there or some shit.

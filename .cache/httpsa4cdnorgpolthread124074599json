Ranking GOP members and DNC members have called today&#039;s version D.O.A. and Cruz has spoken out about how much that pisses him off. What does that mean? Since, the state waiver and high-risk pools are the most hotly contested parts of the bill, the GOP will have to drop one of those to get 51 members; of course, that means they&#039;ll also have to get around the 60 vote needed without budget reconciliation. A current count released right after the MacArthur Amendment put it in the high 20s. That means they&#039;ll need to convince not less than 21 moderate GOP members to vote their way. Without losing one of the two options, there&#039;s no real way to get those votes. This leaves you with Obamacare lite if you lose the state waiver, and with a disaster if you lose the high-risk pools because it will result in millions losing any hope at insurance (this is because putting high-risk people in with low risk has been shown to dump the high-riskers out of insurance, but also keep the remainder rates high). Unfortunately, absent a full repeal, there is no good way to re-do the ACA. You&#039;ll never get a full repeal through before the re-election.","time":1493914669,"resto":124074599,"id":"LljOtqqU","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":124075691,"now":"05\/04\/17(Thu)12:17:54","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p124075597\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;124075597<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;USA are completely artificial.<\/span><br>because of government intervention","time":1493914674,"resto":124074599,"id":"Wb\/Bnb1S","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":124075765,"now":"05\/04\/17(Thu)12:18:37","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p124075691\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;124075691<\/a><br>ok? <br>I dont understand how that makes you think I want people to be given shit for free.","time":1493914717,"resto":124074599,"id":"K\/Qgmgrg","country":"NL","country_name":"Netherlands"},{"no":124075825,"now":"05\/04\/17(Thu)12:19:09","name":"Anonymous","com":"so let&#039;s say you&#039;re born with a heart condition and your parents cover you with their health insurance that they had for years before you&#039;re born.<br><br>so you&#039;re covered and don&#039;t have a pre-existing condition. <br><br>what happens when you&#039;re an adult and need your own policy? do you have to pay more for being born wrong?<br><br>serious question","time":1493914749,"resto":124074599,"id":"EcZVFXob","country":"AU","country_name":"Australia"},{"no":124075846,"now":"05\/04\/17(Thu)12:19:23","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p124075142\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;124075142<\/a><br><a href=\"#p124074812\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;124074812<\/a><br><br>Horse fucking shit.<br><br>My wife who was 25 at the time got denied coverage, despite being disease free and healthy, because she had a fuckin kidney stone removed and only got 1 follow up ultra-sound instead of 3 follow-up ultrasounds.

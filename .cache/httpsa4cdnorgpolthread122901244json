This anti-public lands fringe want to make it much harder to use the Antiquities Act to protect national monuments, and even seeks to tear down existing monuments\u2014notably Utah&#039;s Bears Ears, considered a textbook case for monument designation, whose wealth of ancient ruins, petroglyphs and other cultural sites was damaged by looting, vandalism and even grave-robbing before President Obama moved to protect it in 2016. <\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Signed into law by Theodore Roosevelt in 1906, the Antiquities Act authorizes presidents to protect important archaeological, historic and scientific resources on public lands. It has been used on a bipartisan basis by almost every president, a method supported by some 90 percent of voters that forms the backbone of our National Park System. Trump&#039;s executive order symbolizes a profound break with America&#039;s conservation legacy.<\/span>","filename":"WhatsApp-Image-2017-04-06-at-18.58.55-1","ext":".jpg","w":1024,"h":768,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":187,"tim":1493223415909,"time":1493223415,"md5":"lRveI8yIHCfd6oMm00k7tA==","fsize":132103,"resto":0,"id":"r0uyDJpD","country":"IL","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"drumpfkins-will-defend-this","country_name":"Israel","replies":10,"images":3,"unique_ips":10},{"no":122901474,"now":"04\/26\/17(Wed)12:18:46","name":"Anonymous","com":"Raping America right up the ass in 679 dimensions.","time":1493223526,"resto":122901244,"id":"9OQJsoWG","country":"IL","country_name":"Israel"},{"no":122901944,"now":"04\/26\/17(Wed)12:22:32","name":"Anonymous","com":"You should like him, he&#039;s \/yourgoy\/.","filename":"serveimage","ext":".jpg","w":750,"h":781,"tn_w":120,"tn_h":125,"tim":1493223752038,"time":1493223752,"md5":"7ZMN3q+wV6FfW1yZG5Oopg==","fsize":38741,"resto":122901244,"id":"q\/HcQkKg","country":"DE","country_name":"Germany"},{"no":122902384,"now":"04\/26\/17(Wed)12:26:10","name":"Anonymous","com":"<span class=\"quote\">&gt;(((they))) actually give a shit about our national monuments.<\/span><br><br>fuck off.","time":1493223970,"resto":122901244,"id":"I7JRsQOd","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":122902540,"now":"04\/26\/17(Wed)12:27:27","name":"Anonymous","com":"They use national parks for DUMBs, there&#039;s left over evidence of one in Massachusetts.","time":1493224047,"resto":122901244,"id":"SNJtwVCJ","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":122903747,"now":"04\/26\/17(Wed)12:37:14","name":"Anonymous","com":"Can&#039;t disagree.

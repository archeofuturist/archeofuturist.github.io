It was worth it, but i started at 19 going for it. Ide say if you are considering it go for your Associates. You dont need a BSN to be a nurse and I found out too late. BSNs dont get paid more, they just get picked easier for management positions but who The fuck would want to be a nursemanager its awful.<br><br>Most hospitals will pay you after a year or two to get your bachelors anyways.

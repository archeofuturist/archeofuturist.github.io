That is they carry no reprocussions whatsoever to the elected official. What say you we do about this? This is a totally unnatural position to be in. Failures are always met with unforgiving reprocussions in the wild. Why is it we have no feedback mechanism as a society to prevent this? Do you think voting once every four years is enough to guide our titanic mass effectively? If you do I feel very sorry for you and your stupidity.","filename":"17861620_1203358393106787_8156032133967140437_n","ext":".jpg","w":677,"h":682,"tn_w":248,"tn_h":250,"tim":1493293494085,"time":1493293494,"md5":"GPLwf09pz1Aa5LLGMCW9xA==","fsize":64098,"resto":0,"id":"oE7AOOIo","country":"CA","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"political-inability","country_name":"Canada","replies":2,"images":0,"unique_ips":3},{"no":123027779,"now":"04\/27\/17(Thu)07:49:39","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123027460\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123027460<\/a><br>what a curious image you&#039;ve posted","time":1493293779,"resto":123027460,"id":"H+ZbWsIJ","country":"JP","country_name":"Japan"},{"no":123028098,"now":"04\/27\/17(Thu)07:54:18","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123027460\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123027460<\/a><br>Here&#039;s the thing: Athenian Democracy is red-pilled. <br>But it needs changes.

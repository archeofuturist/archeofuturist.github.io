Muhammad was a genocidal killer and tyrant warlord, muhammad is Allah&#039;s perfect muslim, Allah&#039;s perfect human prototype who must be copied in 100% of ways to be 100% muslim. Islam is a political system not a religion dipshit. ISIS and other brutal jihadist killers and sex slave owners are copying muhammad quite well.","time":1491281732,"resto":119423991,"id":"LePoeY+0","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":119433288,"now":"04\/04\/17(Tue)00:58:10","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119427347\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119427347<\/a><br>that&#039;s because mudslimes are savages. <br>you know there&#039;s something wrong when you need to be congratulated for being normal","time":1491281890,"resto":119423991,"id":"zuj3yiGc","country":"CA","country_name":"Canada"},{"no":119436917,"now":"04\/04\/17(Tue)01:41:00","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119429951\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119429951<\/a><br>Central manly here and I think you&#039;re a brainwashed piece of shit.<br><br>The only reason we&#039;re the lucky country is because we used to have a white australia policy.","time":1491284460,"resto":119423991,"id":"zWuTwWJ+","country":"AU","country_name":"Australia"},{"no":119437362,"now":"04\/04\/17(Tue)01:46:04","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119428995\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119428995<\/a><br><br>maybe when the broccoli starts blowing people up you can compare the two you fucking retard","time":1491284764,"resto":119423991,"id":"fmx9lM8m","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":119437579,"now":"04\/04\/17(Tue)01:48:42","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119423991\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119423991<\/a><br>Like pottery.","filename":"1491249758485","ext":".png","w":482,"h":574,"tn_w":104,"tn_h":124,"tim":1491284922754,"time":1491284922,"md5":"i76nCAfCTg+Vabtl2d7v3w==","fsize":91765,"resto":119423991,"id":"Exak1Kww","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":119437811,"now":"04\/04\/17(Tue)01:51:18","name":"Anonymous","com":"Is everyone falling for the aussie shitposting INTENTIONALLY?","time":1491285078,"resto":119423991,"id":"Exak1Kww","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":119438172,"now":"04\/04\/17(Tue)01:55:33","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119428394\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119428394<\/a><br>Kebabs","time":1491285333,"resto":119423991,"id":"tg+GODzK","country":"NZ","country_name":"New Zealand"},{"no":119438648,"now":"04\/04\/17(Tue)02:01:39","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119428995\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119428995<\/a><br>TFW broccoli comes flying at you 4000 FPS ripping your flesh right off the bone leaving you lying in a pool of your own blood screaming in pain kicking your stumps around while being stood over by a bearded middle eastern that only knows one phrase in english<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Death to America<\/span><br><br>gives the broccoli mandate a whole new meaning.<br> Rip scallia peace be upon him.","filename":"In My Day","ext":".png","w":1444,"h":978,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":84,"tim":1491285699583,"time":1491285699,"md5":"BY+k+xc1aR518byMpsM69A==","fsize":1588930,"resto":119423991,"id":"wy5H3P0i","country":"US","m_img":1,"country_name":"United States"},{"no":119438791,"now":"04\/04\/17(Tue)02:03:42","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119428651\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119428651<\/a><br>learning what exactly?

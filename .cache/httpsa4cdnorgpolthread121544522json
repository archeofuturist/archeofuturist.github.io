Humanity gets to a certain stage in society and then there is a reset. It happened during the last ice age, which is why all cultures talk about a great flood. It happened with rome. It will happen again. Why?<br><br>I have come to think of it as a great refining process, human technology and society evolves to a certain point, and this enables huge populations of retards to develop. Maybe it&#039;s magical, or perfectly logical from a scientific aspect, but humanity keeps resetting once we reach a certain stage. This would imply there is a great catastrophe on it&#039;s way, but it won&#039;t be a giant flood. All I can say is that something is coming shortly, judging by the pattern I see among ancient civilizations.<br><br>Also dragons and shit are cool.<br><br>tl;dr shitloads of people are going to die, because it keeps happening all through-out history when there is just too much &quot;civilization&quot;.","filename":"Nuke-650x360","ext":".jpg","w":650,"h":360,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":138,"tim":1492446268323,"time":1492446268,"md5":"NKEdDlzlOqVN\/VhBSLQDPQ==","fsize":43041,"resto":0,"id":"mKzrGlql","country":"CA","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"societies-reset-switch","country_name":"Canada","replies":1,"images":0,"unique_ips":2},{"no":121545122,"now":"04\/17\/17(Mon)12:29:51","name":"SAGE","com":"<a href=\"#p121544522\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121544522<\/a><br><br>We need it anon. the next catastrophe will be the collapse of the global economic system.

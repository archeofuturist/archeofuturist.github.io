If you have any curiosity about Trump, or wonder how he was allowed to become the Republican nominee with no actual resistance from the establishment, you&#039;re not paying close enough attention. You should have noticed the narrative flip the day he was confirmed as Republican nominee, and Trump knew it would. The true hatred towards him within the establishment did not begin, though, until he made the statement about Russia releasing Hillary&#039;s hacked emails. He wen&#039;t off script. But why?

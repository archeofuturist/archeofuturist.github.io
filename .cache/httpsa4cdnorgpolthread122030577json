Legislative text of a new deal that could revive the House Republican bid to repeal Obamacare is likely to be circulated Friday &quot;or by the weekend,&quot; according to two senior White House officials, with an eye toward holding a House floor vote next Wednesday or Thursday.<\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;According to a draft of the tentative deal obtained by POLITICO, the latest proposal would allow states to apply for &quot;limited waivers&quot; that would undermine Obamacare&#039;s protections for pre-existing conditions. Under these waivers, states could opt out of Obamacare standards setting minimum benefits that health plans must offer and a requirement \u2014 called community rating \u2014 forbidding insurers from charging different prices to people based on health status. Both are provisions that the GOP\u2019s ultraconservatives have pushed to eliminate as part of the repeal effort, contending that these coverage mandates drive up the cost of insurance.<\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;States opting out of the community rating rules would be forced to set up separate insurance pools, known as high-risk pools, where people priced out of the private market could purchase coverage.<\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;The question is whether it can get 216 votes in the House and the answer isn&#039;t clear at this time,\u201d said a senior GOP aide. \u201cThere is no legislative text and therefore no agreement to do a whip count on.&quot;<\/span><br><br>Because one national embarrassment wasn&#039;t enough for these masochists?<br>They must really want those savings for their wealthy tax cuts.","filename":"Capture","ext":".png","w":533,"h":641,"tn_w":207,"tn_h":250,"tim":1492716616820,"time":1492716616,"md5":"WvSe7vmNUxvFELbbMYJ9yg==","fsize":73856,"resto":0,"id":"aTrDQ7sh","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"trumpcare-2-electric-boogaloo","country_name":"United States","replies":4,"images":2,"unique_ips":4},{"no":122031118,"now":"04\/20\/17(Thu)15:34:37","name":"Anonymous","com":"He walked away from a bad deal and marginalized cuck ryan, now they make a real deal.

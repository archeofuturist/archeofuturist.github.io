It takes days to set up a liquid fueled missile the norks can never respond with a nuclear weapon as they have not miniaturized. All there active missiles are medium range 900-1500 km those number less than 200 at the high side and they are liquid fuel as well the Rodong-1(SCUD). They have nothing in they way of a nuclear strike response ability. <br><br>All they have is about 20 heavy mobile artillery the M-1978 effective range 60km. 1000-1500 APC carriers for troop movement not much fuel though. There anti tank is pretty much RPG and anti air is MANPADS. Supposedly they can field a million men but come on after the first Gulf War that troop number is a mirage. Also the artillery number is inflated with old ass Type 63 multiple rocket launcher of about 4000 this represent half of there entire artillery force effective range 8km.<br><br>It is a paper tiger.","filename":"4ab40b3dc3ab30d2792c6c86e3e1c624","ext":".jpg","w":304,"h":380,"tn_w":100,"tn_h":125,"tim":1492154997860,"time":1492154997,"md5":"PX5ajmmvSMi5VmSoFtTP0w==","fsize":15927,"resto":121006072,"id":"EtkKrlPH","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":121033279,"now":"04\/14\/17(Fri)03:31:13","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121033195\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121033195<\/a><br>Only needs to reach the American vessels in the Korean sea.

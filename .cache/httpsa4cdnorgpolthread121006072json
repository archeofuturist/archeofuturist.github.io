Norks know nothing of the outside world.<\/span><br>False. In fact they are shown a considerable amount of it in propaganda videos. By their system of governance\/indoctrination people are trained to see the state as a sort of motherly figure that protects them from the evils of the world. Part of that protection involves showing them those evils. <br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;#3. Norks want to kill us all.<\/span><br>More complete horse shit.

Over 1.5 million Nork civilians were killed or maimed in US bombing runs during the Korean war. They have every reason to want to blow you faggots up. To make matters worse, in their propaganda, they claim this number to be higher (4 million). They fear the US. <br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;#5.

During their famine in the 90s, President Clinton grovelled before Kim Jong Il, until he agreed to allow US aid workers in to help the Nork people. (Kim spent the whole time hiding from the public eye). Since their system heavily promotes isolationism. <br><br>This was also one of the first times the outside world actually got to see NK.

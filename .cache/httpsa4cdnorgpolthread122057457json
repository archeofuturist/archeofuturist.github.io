I understand what I&#039;m made of. People from Spain are Caucasian. But in the U.S., educators don&#039;t teach you anything about Spain.<\/span><br><br>Prove to me that white isn&#039;t subjective and ever-changing. Us Mexicans (northern Mexicans at least) were always considered white up until the latter half of the 20th century. Do you know who took control during that time? Yep, the eternal (((nuisance))). Pic related is clear proof of how there are white Europeans who immigrated to Latin America in the 19th and 20th century whose offspring remains here to this day.<br><br>The &quot;white Argentinian&quot; is a meme that you \/pol\/acks perpetuate to this day but I&#039;ll tell you that it is quite accurate. According to<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Arge<wbr>ntines#Overview<\/span><br>The Argentine is proven to be 86% white and THOUSANDS of European immigrants came there throughout the latter part of the 19th century and the early 19th century. This should tell you that there is a presence of white hispanics and that you should not limit that presence if it risks a less white America.","filename":"95869478538735","ext":".jpg","w":1536,"h":2251,"tn_w":170,"tn_h":250,"tim":1492728444778,"time":1492728444,"md5":"mcQ9npSD1yK4QNc6SPw81w==","fsize":550356,"resto":0,"id":"e2vjg7f4","country":"US","m_img":1,"bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"the-spic-redpill-you-wont-believe-it","country_name":"United States","replies":7,"images":2,"unique_ips":6},{"no":122057556,"now":"04\/20\/17(Thu)18:48:06","name":"Anonymous","com":"<span class=\"quote\">&gt;is X white<\/span><br><br>Friendly reminder that Israel\/CIA\/Shariablue create these threads in an attempt to confuse you as to what is and is not white, thus resulting in the loss of racial identity.

Hillary Clinton and President Barack Obama are supporting the construction of a pipeline from Qatar through Syria to Turkey and Bulgaria.<br><br>However, Syrian president Bashir Al-Assad had blocked that pipeline\u2019s construction, because he is supporting another oil pipeline to be constructed through his country from Iran to Greece. Moreover, Assad is being supported in doing so by Putin, the Russian president.<br><br>Thus two axis of evil have arisen. We have Qatar and Saudi Arabia facing off against Iran, Russia and Syria. Turkey being a NATO member, the United States and the Europeam Union, Saudi loyals, are waging war against Syria to prevent the competing pipeline from being built. Worse, they are actively arming local terror groups such as ISIS and Al Qaida against Assad and Putin.","time":1491518884,"resto":119800453,"id":"NLiTdWFG","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":119809278,"now":"04\/06\/17(Thu)18:48:22","name":"Anonymous","com":"How many of you are actually paid Russian shills?

Make sure He is not ashamed!","filename":"maxresdefault (8)","ext":".jpg","w":1280,"h":720,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":70,"tim":1491520562004,"time":1491520562,"md5":"B+r2oFzAppeZKn8m6N1XHg==","fsize":31988,"resto":119800453,"id":"2ncoWXDm","country":"US","m_img":1,"country_name":"United States"},{"no":119813042,"now":"04\/06\/17(Thu)19:16:18","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119811951\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119811951<\/a><br>lol. name one country on earth who would want to go to war with the US in a conventional war. everyone hates us so much but they never do shit and never will.","time":1491520578,"resto":119800453,"id":"A2rHYlKi","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":119813051,"now":"04\/06\/17(Thu)19:16:24","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119811047\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119811047<\/a><br><a href=\"#p119811047\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119811047<\/a><br>You are one stupid fool","time":1491520584,"resto":119800453,"id":"QFA22GLL","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":119813152,"now":"04\/06\/17(Thu)19:17:04","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119812950\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119812950<\/a><br>USA should help assad restrore order with our allies russia helping too","time":1491520624,"resto":119800453,"id":"Om7LkOgl","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":119813165,"now":"04\/06\/17(Thu)19:17:13","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119800793\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119800793<\/a><br>The emperor has no clothes","time":1491520633,"resto":119800453,"id":"2iacYkJp","country":"FI","country_name":"Finland"},{"no":119813216,"now":"04\/06\/17(Thu)19:17:38","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119800779\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119800779<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Erase Assad,<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;then Putin next.<\/span><br><br>Whatever (((you))) say","filename":"1483846463638","ext":".jpg","w":499,"h":499,"tn_w":124,"tn_h":124,"tim":1491520658392,"time":1491520658,"md5":"A9xLUNApTsuow2ksPprd1A==","fsize":43388,"resto":119800453,"id":"8FC6VGeB","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":119813285,"now":"04\/06\/17(Thu)19:18:11","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119801688\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119801688<\/a><br>Noice","filename":"1489881818355","ext":".gif","w":1255,"h":585,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":58,"tim":1491520691832,"time":1491520691,"md5":"fNoHglpbnGB4Z+H5c+pqIQ==","fsize":77882,"resto":119800453,"id":"OTR7bWr\/","country":"AU","country_name":"Australia"},{"no":119813301,"now":"04\/06\/17(Thu)19:18:18","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119812531\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119812531<\/a><br>Ride the Lightning, faggot","filename":"1491396519032","ext":".jpg","w":1024,"h":1018,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":124,"tim":1491520698830,"time":1491520698,"md5":"Ke65+b2TwiFpnpSc+t7V1Q==","fsize":114735,"resto":119800453,"id":"QFA22GLL","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":119813402,"now":"04\/06\/17(Thu)19:19:03","name":"Anonymous","com":"He didn&#039;t do it because it was all fake, you plebeian.","time":1491520743,"resto":119800453,"id":"G\/zC4ISM","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":119813478,"now":"04\/06\/17(Thu)19:19:40","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119800779\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119800779<\/a><br><a href=\"#p119812042\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119812042<\/a>","filename":"1.

Golf has long been a powerful business tool. It lets people who are vehemently opposed, or at least guarded towards each other, relate in a competitive but good natured way. It allows them to discuss business if it naturally occurs, but generally helps to let people get acquainted before they begin real negotiations. An incredible aid to business (i.e. diplomatic) relationships. Obama rarely used it in this way, (or at least as far as could be seen). The majority of Trump&#039;s golfing has been obviously diplomatic, either creating channels of conversation in American high society, or building a relationship with foreign leaders. We don&#039;t know who Obama was golfing with. He used it as a measure of obfuscation. Either he was escaping from the business of the presidency, or he was meeting with people he didn&#039;t want anybody to know he was meeting. The useful idiots of the right jumped on the image of a lazy president shirking his responsibility. This was done to put pressure on Obama, to call attention to the fact that he was not so clever as he seemed. The people who were paying attention knew something was up. Strategically probably not the best call in hindsight, but sound tactics. For opposite reasons, this is why the media isn&#039;t calling out Trump much for his golfing. To do so would bring attention to how much Trump is working with a wide variety of people to get things done. Paying attention to this would destroy the narrative that Trump has been stonewalled, and that he&#039;s too cocky and arrogant and everybody hates him. You can&#039;t say he&#039;s an embarrassment to the world when he&#039;s building strong relationships with world leaders that we&#039;ve been ignoring for 8 or so years. He&#039;s engaging in really good American diplomacy, and that&#039;s a bad thing for the MSM to call out.","time":1491840791,"resto":120450420,"id":"g0BNO+pK","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":120453494,"now":"04\/10\/17(Mon)12:13:14","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120453227\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120453227<\/a><br>This is exactly what presidents sign up for.","time":1491840794,"resto":120450420,"id":"wRqOAO80","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":120453728,"now":"04\/10\/17(Mon)12:15:17","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120453494\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120453494<\/a><br>He would be more productive if he is less stressed.

Again it&#039;s how he&#039;s doing it that&#039;s the issue. If he really just wanted to golf he could do it somewhere closer to DC. Why is it imperative that he go to Florida every time, and why does he have to go there every single weekend? If your answer is because he has to go to Mar-A-Lago then I&#039;d ask what is so special about doing business there? If he wants out of the White House he could have bought a building in DC for the 70 million he&#039;s wasted so far and spared America another 70 million for all the trips he&#039;s going to make.","time":1491842624,"resto":120450420,"id":"wAIJfDWa","country":"CA","country_name":"Canada"},{"no":120456859,"now":"04\/10\/17(Mon)12:43:50","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120456125\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120456125<\/a><br>but seriously the nuclear codes","filename":"1474597069736","ext":".gif","w":200,"h":200,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":125,"tim":1491842630045,"time":1491842630,"md5":"e4saQJbzemn6zmdHuH9VXQ==","fsize":1915993,"resto":120450420,"id":"ifhFj3lG","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":120456904,"now":"04\/10\/17(Mon)12:44:20","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120456639\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120456639<\/a><br>Maybe if we had, we wouldn&#039;t have gotten into this situation?","time":1491842660,"resto":120450420,"id":"g0BNO+pK","country":"US","country_name":"United States"}]}

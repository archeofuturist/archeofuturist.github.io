Golf has long been a powerful business tool. It lets people who are vehemently opposed, or at least guarded towards each other, relate in a competitive but good natured way. It allows them to discuss business if it naturally occurs, but generally helps to let people get acquainted before they begin real negotiations. An incredible aid to business (i.e. diplomatic) relationships. Obama rarely used it in this way, (or at least as far as could be seen). The majority of Trump&#039;s golfing has been obviously diplomatic, either creating channels of conversation in American high society, or building a relationship with foreign leaders. We don&#039;t know who Obama was golfing with. He used it as a measure of obfuscation. Either he was escaping from the business of the presidency, or he was meeting with people he didn&#039;t want anybody to know he was meeting. The useful idiots of the right jumped on the image of a lazy president shirking his responsibility. This was done to put pressure on Obama, to call attention to the fact that he was not so clever as he seemed. The people who were paying attention knew something was up. Strategically probably not the best call in hindsight, but sound tactics. For opposite reasons, this is why the media isn&#039;t calling out Trump much for his golfing. To do so would bring attention to how much Trump is working with a wide variety of people to get things done. Paying attention to this would destroy the narrative that Trump has been stonewalled, and that he&#039;s too cocky and arrogant and everybody hates him. You can&#039;t say he&#039;s an embarrassment to the world when he&#039;s building strong relationships with world leaders that we&#039;ve been ignoring for 8 or so years. He&#039;s engaging in really good American diplomacy, and that&#039;s a bad thing for the MSM to call out.","time":1491840791,"resto":120450420,"id":"g0BNO+pK","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":120453494,"now":"04\/10\/17(Mon)12:13:14","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120453227\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120453227<\/a><br>This is exactly what presidents sign up for.","time":1491840794,"resto":120450420,"id":"wRqOAO80","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":120453728,"now":"04\/10\/17(Mon)12:15:17","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120453494\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120453494<\/a><br>He would be more productive if he is less stressed.

The three branches of government have very purposefully been set up with different levels of public access. Congress is supposed to be the most accessible. The court the least. The executive in between. In turn, congress has the widest set of options, the presidents actions are more limited, and the court is the most limited. The president has to be able to negotiate without immediate public access. That&#039;s a necessity of governance. The kinds of things he can negotiate, and the ability to implement those negotiations are limited by congress. He&#039;s on a leash. This means he can only promise so much to foreign powers before completely losing their trust. So yes, it&#039;s really important that the President can negotiate privately. Critically important. This is why the selection of president, and knowing his incentives is really important. If someone like Jeb or Clinton has been bought out by lobbyists, then their ability to negotiate fairly on the behalf of the public is called into question. For what he has had, Trump has historically done far above average in negotiations. Better than everyone else on any of the ballots this year. Now he has more tools and more power. If this scares you, then you better make damn sure congress and the courts are working as they&#039;re supposed to.","time":1491844863,"resto":120450420,"id":"g0BNO+pK","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":120460763,"now":"04\/10\/17(Mon)13:21:10","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120450420\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120450420<\/a><br>You&#039;ve never heard of business being done on the golf course? <br><br>I have heard stories about Donald himself on his own courses, and it&#039;s all business.

It&#039;s not just a training of the body, but a training of the mind. The ability to read a course correctly is a skill few ever master. They&#039;re all designed to trick you. Surrounded by nature, that&#039;s been sculpted by man, your only real competitor is yourself. Every other player is just a measure of how much self-control you have compared to the average man. There is no reason behind it. No purpose. It&#039;s insane to consider that you are trying to get this tiny ball into a tiny hole, hundreds of yards away, that&#039;s been purposefully put in the most inconvenient place. Trying to get there reveals who you really are. Not just grit, like in other sports, but mental control and personality. It takes strength, but the right shot rarely takes your full power. It takes immense precision, and yet, the movement is too quick to think. It can only be accomplished through complete trust of self. And after all this, it is still just a walk in a park. This great battle is taken with dignity and composure. Only men can really play golf. Everyone else is just playing with sticks.","time":1491845887,"resto":120450420,"id":"g0BNO+pK","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":120462698,"now":"04\/10\/17(Mon)13:38:32","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120462327\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120462327<\/a><br>Thanks for confirming everything I already know about people like yourself.

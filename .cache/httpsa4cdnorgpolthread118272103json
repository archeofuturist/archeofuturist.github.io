These documents explain the techniques used by CIA to gain &#039;persistence&#039; on Apple Mac devices, including Macs and iPhones and demonstrate their use of EFI\/UEFI and firmware malware.<br><br>Among others, these documents reveal the &quot;Sonic Screwdriver&quot; project which, as explained by the CIA, is a &quot;mechanism for executing code on peripheral devices while a Mac laptop or desktop is booting&quot; allowing an attacker to boot its attack software for example from a USB stick &quot;even when a firmware password is enabled&quot;. The CIA&#039;s &quot;Sonic Screwdriver&quot; infector is stored on the modified firmware of an Apple Thunderbolt-to-Ethernet adapter.<br><br>&quot;DarkSeaSkies&quot; is &quot;an implant that persists in the EFI firmware of an Apple MacBook Air computer&quot; and consists of &quot;DarkMatter&quot;, &quot;SeaPea&quot; and &quot;NightSkies&quot;, respectively EFI, kernel-space and user-space implants.<br><br>Documents on the &quot;Triton&quot; MacOSX malware, its infector &quot;Dark Mallet&quot; and its EFI-persistent version &quot;DerStarke&quot; are also included in this release. While the DerStarke1.4 manual released today dates to 2013, other Vault 7 documents show that as of 2016 the CIA continues to rely on and update these systems and is working on the production ofDerStarke2.0.","time":1490476959,"resto":118272103,"id":"fixeOUY0","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":118274213,"now":"03\/25\/17(Sat)17:23:56","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118274072\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118274072<\/a><br>Also included in this release is the manual for the CIA&#039;s &quot;NightSkies 1.2&quot; a &quot;beacon\/loader\/implant tool&quot; for the Apple iPhone.

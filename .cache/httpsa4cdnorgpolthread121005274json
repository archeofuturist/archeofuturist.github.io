How can this problem be solved?<br><br>I&#039;d advocate for a multi-pronged solution. Further luxury housing construction of projects such as 432 Park Avenue should be banned until some numerical figure for affordability, such as 75% of the city being able to pay monthly rent with at most 50% of their wages is reached. Until then, cheaper and more generally available vertically constructed housing units should be prioritized for construction. Owners of multiple properties should be encouraged or forced to rent out or use as many of their properties as possible to avoid price-gouging or needless inflation. Cities could also construct public and subsidized vertical housing complexes for the homeless, which all in all would likely save money and improve the cities greatly by removing the homeless off the streets.<br><br>What would the optimal solution to this pricing crisis be? Is it even solvable? What do you think?","filename":"432ParkAve","ext":".jpg","w":2000,"h":1000,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":125,"tim":1492137174496,"time":1492137174,"md5":"hCYZswUwikeAaLiwRasUMA==","fsize":1977255,"resto":0,"id":"ew0rF1Ei","country":"US","m_img":1,"bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"how-to-solve-the-housing-price-crisis","country_name":"United States","replies":15,"images":3,"unique_ips":14},{"no":121005528,"now":"04\/13\/17(Thu)22:35:01","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121005274\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121005274<\/a><br>stop immigration","time":1492137301,"resto":121005274,"id":"Ydrjw6X5","country":"CA","country_name":"Canada"},{"no":121005698,"now":"04\/13\/17(Thu)22:36:29","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121005274\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121005274<\/a><br><br>aren&#039;t those called housing projects?","filename":"d06","ext":".jpg","w":1000,"h":750,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":93,"tim":1492137389901,"time":1492137389,"md5":"CP+2SM80bTWrYh\/Dc4yIwA==","fsize":254220,"resto":121005274,"id":"Ne2K6WXj","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":121005899,"now":"04\/13\/17(Thu)22:38:12","name":"Anonymous","com":"Make a separate city for niggers and illegal immigrants.

The key prerequisite for IUT is Mochizuki&#039;s mono-anabelian geometry and its powerful reconstruction results, which restore various one-dimensional and two-dimensional scheme-theoretic objects associated to the hyperbolic curves over the number field from the knowledge of its fundamental group or certain Galois groups. IUT applies algorithmic results of mono-anabelian geometry to reconstruct relevant schemes after applying arithmetic deformations to them; a key role is played by three rigidities established in Mochizuki&#039;s etale-theta function theory. Roughly speaking, arithmetic deformations change the multiplication of a given ring, and the task is to measure how much the addition is changed.[8] Infrastructure for deformation procedures is decoded by certain links between theaters, such as a theta-link and a log-link.[9] These links are not compatible with ring or scheme structures and are performed outside conventional arithmetic geometry. However, they are compatible with certain group structures, and absolute Galois groups as well as certain types of topological groups play a fundamental role in IUT. Considerations of multiradiality, a generalization of functoriality, imply that three mild indeterminacies have to be introduced.[9] The effect of these indeterminacies eventually results in the epsilon term in the inequalities such as the strong Szpiro conjecture over any number field and part of the Vojta&#039;s conjecture for the case of hyperbolic curves over any number field, as well as other equivalent forms. Aside from the prime number theorem, IUT does not use analytic number theory.<\/span>","time":1493096906,"resto":122683670,"id":"G7bWVHfc","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":122695914,"now":"04\/25\/17(Tue)01:08:51","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122695669\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122695669<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;this coming from Poland of all people<\/span>","filename":"trash","ext":".gif","w":580,"h":433,"tn_w":124,"tn_h":93,"tim":1493096931361,"time":1493096931,"md5":"NX1Ess0w0mnIW93JyXfoWw==","fsize":1643670,"resto":122683670,"id":"rKlCqdmh","country":"CA","country_name":"Canada"},{"no":122695917,"now":"04\/25\/17(Tue)01:08:53","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122687643\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122687643<\/a><br><br>The Jomon top-left looks exactly like a irish-german-italian-spanish relative of mine.","time":1493096933,"resto":122683670,"id":"LUip29yP","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":122695953,"now":"04\/25\/17(Tue)01:09:16","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122683670\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122683670<\/a><br><br>Why the fuck doesn&#039;t society worship an ubermesch like this?

For example, we choose to devote time to commutative structures (a + b = b + a) because we find that many naturally occurring events that we can model with mathematics follow this law. As it turns out though, these highly abstract works, after sufficient ironing-out, have great applications to physics, statistics, computer science, etc.... See, for example:<br>1. Hardy&#039;s (and any other Number Theorist&#039;s) work on prime numbers; long thought to just be &quot;interesting&quot; to mathematicians, but are now central to cryptography.<br>2. Euler&#039;s solution to the Seven Bridges of Konigsberg Problem. The solution to this required the instantiation of new ideas in mathematics, which led to the modern study of Graph Theory. Graph Theory plays a massive role in the modern world - it is the study of how objects connect to one another.<br>3. Riemann&#039;s work on manifolds - these turned out to form the mathematical structures and framework that general relativity and much of modern physics is built upon.<br><br>Conjectures are also important to prove rigorously - there have been many conjectured mathematical statements that were widely believed to be true until they were disproved. See, for example,<br>1. The work of Godel and his incompleteness theorem(s) (turns out that we can&#039;t build all of mathematics from a nice little set of axioms); <br>2. The Weierstrass function, which is continuous everywhere and differentiable nowhere (you can draw it without every lifting your pen from the paper, but every single point is a sharp edge - it is smooth nowhere);<br>3. The Cantor function, which is continuous everywhere, &quot;flat&quot; almost everywhere (everywhere except a collection of &quot;isolated&quot; points), but is also increasing everywhere.<br><br>So while these theoretical interests do not have an immediate relevance, we often find that mathematics is an important garden to tend.","time":1493099821,"resto":122683670,"id":"\/6ne1Tcg","country":"CA","country_name":"Canada"},{"no":122700608,"now":"04\/25\/17(Tue)01:57:08","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122700165\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122700165<\/a><br>You can learn math.

Many such cases. Anyways, while you&#039;re here I&#039;ve just decided to torch an airbase in Syria cause, fuck it. Try to ignore that while we talk about Best Korea. I&#039;m sure you agree to not criticize the bombing, or anything else for that matter. The 50% tarriff we can talk about later, after I get a damage report from Putin. You OK Ching Ching? Here have another glass of Globalist tears. Oh ya, and about Korea, stand back and protect your eyes. Your wife sure looks hot. Great job Ching. Remember when Chyna was an agrarian society? How long ago was that? I heard Chyna imports a HHHUuuuuge percentage of its food from the U.S. now or you would starve. You look ill Ping Pong, maybe your speech at Devos is on your mind. Don&#039;t worry about it. Relax. I got this.

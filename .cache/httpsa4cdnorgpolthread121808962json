For there is no authority except from God, and the authorities that exist are appointed by God. Therefore whoever resists the authority resists the ordinance of God, and those who resist will bring judgment on themselves. For rulers are not a terror to good works, but to evil. Do you want to be unafraid of the authority? Do what is good, and you will have praise from the same. For he is God\u2019s minister to you for good. But if you do evil, be afraid; for he does not bear the sword in vain; for he is God\u2019s minister, an avenger to execute wrath on him who practices evil. Therefore you must be subject, not only because of wrath but also for conscience\u2019 sake. For because of this you also pay taxes, for they are God\u2019s ministers attending continually to this very thing. Render therefore to all their due: taxes to whom taxes are due, customs to whom customs, fear to whom fear, honor to whom honor.<\/span>","filename":"clasped","ext":".png","w":736,"h":1584,"tn_w":58,"tn_h":124,"tim":1492580902617,"time":1492580902,"md5":"uRHwlgS1ZvgREv9B7N16Fg==","fsize":585324,"resto":121808962,"id":"5xvyc2EJ","country":"US","m_img":1,"country_name":"United States"},{"no":121810019,"now":"04\/19\/17(Wed)01:50:11","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121808962\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121808962<\/a><br>Give unto Ceasar what&#039;s is ceasars<br>Give unto god what is gods","time":1492581011,"resto":121808962,"id":"3vjbMa+R","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":121812547,"now":"04\/19\/17(Wed)02:15:21","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121808962\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121808962<\/a><br><br>The entire bible is about genetics, nations, cultures and peoples.

But the Bulgarians managed to set up a nice little thing going.<br><br>The most widespread range of Bulgarian scientific instruments were the edgy-kid named &quot;EMO&quot; series. EMO-1 was an electrophotometer that flew on a 45-day mission in 1979. Its aims were to study the Earth&#039;s atmosphere during particular moments of maximum solar intensity, and its particular reflective properties during those periods (sorry if the scientific terms are not the right ones, hard to translate Bulgarian scientific language into English). On the 5th April 1979 it recorded particularly powerful &quot;glows&quot; between New Zealand and Antarctica, a hitherto unobserved phenomenon. It thus helped us record our first data on the interaction between the magnetic belts over the southern areas and the charged Solar particles that penetrated them there.","time":1491952911,"resto":120657143,"id":"QRpLXXK2","country":"BG","country_name":"Bulgaria"},{"no":120675939,"now":"04\/11\/17(Tue)19:22:38","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120663114\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120663114<\/a><br>pffffft","filename":"1438033298551","ext":".jpg","w":2340,"h":2355,"tn_w":124,"tn_h":125,"tim":1491952958035,"time":1491952958,"md5":"eDRDujzefluWBvDT6R9NAw==","fsize":945049,"resto":120657143,"id":"HfehRELI","country":"US","m_img":1,"country_name":"United States"},{"no":120675951,"now":"04\/11\/17(Tue)19:22:43","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120675627\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120675627<\/a><br>I think because of political reasons","time":1491952963,"resto":120657143,"id":"ChV+MCIw","country":"RU","country_name":"Russian Federation"},{"no":120675986,"now":"04\/11\/17(Tue)19:22:55","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120675608\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120675608<\/a><br>Are we fighting?

Not much you could have heard about it, back when it was truly active it was subsumed within Interkosmos and I suspect in the USA this was all seen as USSR-driven. There were a lot of internal politics within the program, with Bulgarians and others (East Germans, Poles etc) trying to push through their own agendas. Of course, Bulgaria could not have the industrial capacity to produce its own rockets and engines, so it concentrated on what it could do - participating in space research and sending cosmonauts. One of the reasons it sought co-operation not just with the USSR but the nascent Indian space program. I find these efforts of a small country trying to contribute to human endevour pretty inspiring. Obviously I have an affinity for the Bulgarian one, but there were plenty of smaller countries that were doing similar things. I just hope Bulgaria resurrects what it has and participates in some ESA projects. But with the brain-drain, the total collapse of science funding and the academy that produced these kinds of things...I am stuck posting about its history.","time":1491954604,"resto":120657143,"id":"QRpLXXK2","country":"BG","country_name":"Bulgaria"},{"no":120679593,"now":"04\/11\/17(Tue)19:50:10","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120678173\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120678173<\/a><br><a href=\"#p120679130\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120679130<\/a><br>\u042f\u043d\u0442ap and ELO were 10\/10","time":1491954610,"resto":120657143,"id":"UWv8VA1b","country":"BG","country_name":"Bulgaria"},{"no":120679633,"now":"04\/11\/17(Tue)19:50:23","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120678800\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120678800<\/a><br>Yes, but scientific principles don&#039;t change with time.

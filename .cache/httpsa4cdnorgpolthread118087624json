There are so many ways to passively promote an agenda through selecting what topics the public sees and which they don&#039;t. Which has no way of being detected by the &quot;average person&quot; unless they know the organization in question is owned by lying kikes.<br><br>Remember Black Lives Matter? It started as a false media narrative surrounding the Michael Brown \/ Darren Wilson incident, with the media all but saying a racist white supremacist in blue shot an unarmed law abiding black man who had just turned 18. Turned out that wasn&#039;t remotely close to the truth, but by the media&#039;s agenda setting the movement was already taken up by liberal retards, and here we are today.","time":1490370223,"resto":118087624,"id":"VXwQ3PAv","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":118092928,"now":"03\/24\/17(Fri)11:44:30","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118092817\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118092817<\/a><br>Suck a muffler.","time":1490370270,"resto":118087624,"id":"NRG1qiTW","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":118093243,"now":"03\/24\/17(Fri)11:47:15","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118092928\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118092928<\/a><br>That&#039;s what Nunes said.

They exist in the story to temper the occasional obnoxiousness of his male leads and provide emotional support for them in their darkest moments, but its his male characters who are always making the biggest strides for the story and doing all of the left-brained shit that no woman is capable of. Feminazis have actually gotten on his case before because he doesn&#039;t pander to their demands and include &#039;stronk womyn&#039; in his scripts.<br><br>So in a weird way, Sorkin is more red-pilled compared to someone like Whedon or the GoT writers.<br><br>Also keep in mind that much of Sorkin&#039;s stories focus on competitiveness and bravado in fields not normally associated with such traits (computer programming, journalism,etc.) In those kinds of environments, it makes total sense that progress and creativity would be spearheaded by men. Men are the builders and creators, while the females are the beneficiaries and witnesses.","time":1493219501,"resto":122892353,"id":"RgWD6xmg","country":"US","country_name":"United States"}]}

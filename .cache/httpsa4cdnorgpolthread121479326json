There&#039;s a huge siege going on in relation to the # of created threads during American time -vs- the # of responders who post in them. That is to say, that Americans are simply responding to threads instead of creating their own and taking charge of their own shit and (by proxy) their own board. <br><br>I&#039;d like to parse everyone for ideas in which would bring about change in our people in way of the indoctrination not having so much effect; but more literally, how to give our men the balls to stand up to this adversity. <br><br>Is it low IQ? What can be done? <br><br>I&#039;d pledge mods to purge the filth that try to subvert this thread.","filename":"1471272308239","ext":".jpg","w":475,"h":385,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":202,"tim":1492403457648,"time":1492403457,"md5":"idyM55NVPxMZPCCblLCzeg==","fsize":52427,"resto":0,"id":"nKcYnAXF","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"shills-go-to-bed-after-2am-my-hope-changes-after","country_name":"United States","replies":3,"images":0,"unique_ips":3},{"no":121480231,"now":"04\/17\/17(Mon)00:39:12","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121479326\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121479326<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;I&#039;d like to parse everyone for ideas in which would bring about change in our people in way of the indoctrination not having so much effect<\/span><br><br>We need to literally teach people how to autism on their own","time":1492403952,"resto":121479326,"id":"IZ8YsrIF","country":"FI","country_name":"Finland"},{"no":121480933,"now":"04\/17\/17(Mon)00:46:32","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121480231\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121480231<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;autism<\/span><br><br>No, it&#039;s having a grip on reality, just as the people before us had.<br><br>See: any philosopher...

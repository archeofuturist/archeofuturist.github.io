There&#039;s a huge siege going on in relation to the # of created threads during American time -vs- the # of responders who post in them. That is to say, that Americans are simply responding to threads instead of creating their own and taking charge of their own shit and (by proxy) their own board. <br><br>I&#039;d like to parse everyone for ideas in which would bring about change in our people in way of the indoctrination not having so much effect; but more literally, how to give our men the balls to stand up to this adversity. <br><br>Is it low IQ?

Times sure have changed boys. I can still recall the days where it didn&#039;t really matter if the guys dad next door was a republican or democrat. Their kids still all played together. In the taverns, it was considered obscene to talk about religion or politics back then in the taverns, and on top of that, nothing was taken personal anyway. People were more sophisticated and harder to trick back then. The scary part is that EVERYTHING my parents and grandparents said would happen, have happened. No fault divorce, forced auto insurance, no privacy, mexicans, darkies, crime, no jobs, etc. It&#039;s crazy how they were right. And speaking of crazy, where are the men in the long white coats to commit almost all of these politicians on both sides to an insane asylum????<br>50-60 years ago there was no &quot;lesser of two evils&quot; politicians were competitive to a degree. It was all about the better deal back then.

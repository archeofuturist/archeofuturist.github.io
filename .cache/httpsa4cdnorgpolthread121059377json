Be prepared.<br><br>Step 1: Fill your bath with water, any object that can be filled with water must be also filled and covered.<br>Step 2: Seal all windows, doors and anything that has the possibility of airflow throughout the house. (Use duck tape, and any sealant available.)<br>Step 3: Use object around the house to prop up against windows and doors.<br>Step 4: Ration your food for 2 weeks.<br><br>(Use whatever means of communication you have to stay in touch with updates about the areas affected the most.)<br><br>After two weeks if you aren&#039;t able to evacuate the area and you need supplies, fashion a radiation suit out of disposable clothes fitted with anything waterproof on the outside, use bin bags on the outside and any rubber available! Watch for signs of unexplained bruising, pale skin and general unwellness.

A nuclear blast is only so large and if a another country is going to strike America, the are going to either hit a major city or a major military base. No one will bother nuking nowhereville. Even staying with someone outside of the high risk zone for a while until the worst of the threat has subsided will work.<br><br>2. Reinforce your shelter. There is a good chance that your shit shack will collapse in the shock wave. There is a good chance you will die if your shelter collapses.<br><br>3. Limit flammable materials around and on your shelter. Fire will spread throughout the city after the blast. It is only a matter of time before the flames hit your property. The less around your shelter the less likely that the flames will destroy your shelter. <br><br>4. Make your property wet. Roof? wet. Lawn? wet. Trees? remove them and fill the hole with water. The idea is to make your shelter as unwelcoming to any flames as you can. Remember in a fallout, no can help you. If your shelter is burning all of your preparation is as good as gone. A kiddie pool on top your roof looks weird, but can help. If the fire spreads close enough, the heat will melt the plastic releasing the water on the side with the fire.<br><br>5. Get a back up plan. What if you are nowhere near your shelter when the blast hits? What if getting to your shelter would put you in greater risk? What if your shelter is no longer safe? Try and figure out where a nuke might be dropped near you. Using the most probable locations figure out back up plans based on your common activities. You won&#039;t have a lot of warning to get back to your shelter with. A subway tunnel might make a decent makeshift shelter if you can&#039;t get back to your shelter. A large river might save you from burning to death in the after blaze.","time":1492183652,"resto":121059377,"id":"INpjyp6l","country":"CA","country_name":"Canada"},{"no":121072661,"now":"04\/14\/17(Fri)11:28:17","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121059377\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121059377<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;yfw when the newfags thought we were joking <\/span><br><br>http:\/\/www.msn.com\/en-au\/news\/world<wbr>\/n-korean-official-ready-for-war-if<wbr>-trump-wants-it\/ar-BBzQnec?li=AAgfY<wbr>rC&amp;OCID=HPCDHP<br><br>let it be known \/pol\/ was right again","time":1492183697,"resto":121059377,"id":"XXGuFZbw","country":"AU","country_name":"Australia"},{"no":121072664,"now":"04\/14\/17(Fri)11:28:18","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121072383\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121072383<\/a><br>The particles from Chernobyl infected sheep and deer in northern England at the time, they had to be culled.

The most lethal aspect in an explosion is not shrapnel or heat, it is the blast overpressure. The blast wave travels at supersonic velocity and severely affects the air-filled organs like lungs, kidneys, and bowels. We naturally tend to take a deep breath and hold it in emergencies. However, this proves lethal in a bombing situation, since our lungs become like a pressurised balloon to be ruptured by the blast wave. The majority of victims in a typical suicide bombing die from internal bleeding in the lungs. Only 6% on average die from shrapnel wounds.

Apartment Building Bans Flags Near Baseball Stadium","com":"https:\/\/www.washingtonian.com\/2017\/<wbr>04\/18\/dc-apartment-building-trump-b<wbr>anner-nationals-park\/<br><br>\u201cWhile we love our residents creativity and unique decorating, the time has come for us to remind all residents it is a lease violation if you\u2026hang anything off of your balcony\u2014yes this even include banners\/flags supporting our beloved Washington Nationals,\u201d reads the email from building manager Shaun Lambert.<br><br>The likely inspiration for this sudden order, according to one resident, was a rush of political banners in the past few months, starting with a \u201cTrump: Make America Great Again\u201d flag that appeared shortly after last November\u2019s election. The Trump banner was answered by the unit three floors below, which hung Black Lives Matter and rainbow LGBT pride flags from its balcony. An apartment one floor above the Trump-friendly apartment hung a flag proclaiming \u201cResist.\u201d The newest addition, which went up shortly before the start of baseball season, positions the word \u201cNope\u201d accompanied by an upward arrow directly beneath the Trump sign. And now, what was once a gallery of local sports fandom is just another political shouting match.<br><br>Officially, Lambert\u2019s email is a reminder of many balcony activities prohibited by the building\u2019s rental agreements. His note also warns tenants against installing grills or household furniture, leaving unattended pets, and smoking on balconies. But the resident who forwarded the note to Washingtonian says the crackdown only happened after the banner war broke out.<br><br>\u201cThe takeaway is that the flags caused it,\u201d he says.<br>Tenants of Camden South Capitol who object to the redecoration order on First Amendment grounds are unlikely to prevail, according to Joel Cohn, the legislative director for DC\u2019s Office of the Tenant Advocate.<br><br>\u201cGenerally, the balcony rule doesn\u2019t sound that out of the ordinary,\u201d he says.","filename":"flags","ext":".jpg","w":1200,"h":1200,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":250,"tim":1492541724146,"time":1492541724,"md5":"uh4jnqRIBGiHb5+eUGQaEw==","fsize":265863,"resto":0,"id":"dfA4nohY","country":"US","m_img":1,"bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"dc-apartment-building-bans-flags-near-baseball","country_name":"United States","replies":8,"images":3,"unique_ips":9},{"no":121722895,"now":"04\/18\/17(Tue)14:58:26","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121722455\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121722455<\/a><br>Who cares?

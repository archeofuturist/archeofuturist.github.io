Fifty-four percent of those polled said they disapprove of the job the president is doing.<\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Gallup&#039;s poll comes just after Trump&#039;s failed efforts to move the American Healthcare Act through Congress. The bill was withdrawn from consideration on Friday in a move widely seen as a failure for Trump and Speaker of the House Paul Ryan, who supported the bill, and a victory for former President Obama&#039;s signature healthcare legislation.<\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;The president commented via Twitter on the bill&#039;s failure.<\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;&quot;ObamaCare will explode and we will all get together and piece together a great healthcare plan for the people. Do not worry!&quot; the president wrote.<\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Trump&#039;s numbers in Gallup polls have been hovering around the 40 percent mark since his inauguration in late January, historically low approval ratings as compared to other presidents during the initial months of their first terms. At the same point in his first term, former President Obama&#039;s approval rating hovered around 60 percent; former President George W. Bush&#039;s was in the high 50s.<\/span>","filename":"1460690642233","ext":".jpg","w":244,"h":206,"tn_w":244,"tn_h":206,"tim":1490658212491,"time":1490658212,"md5":"B69Q7+G9jBaVJcS7TWtCKg==","fsize":3934,"resto":0,"id":"ddJe7xC7","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"donald-trump-approval-rating-failed-healthcare","country_name":"United States","replies":19,"images":7,"unique_ips":16},{"no":118581386,"now":"03\/27\/17(Mon)19:51:31","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118580502\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118580502<\/a>","filename":"1478552693070","ext":".png","w":293,"h":324,"tn_w":113,"tn_h":125,"tim":1490658691327,"time":1490658691,"md5":"rcvkksiZpcYf5wu3i3KZZw==","fsize":94379,"resto":118580502,"id":"Kj51+Mwb","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":118581585,"now":"03\/27\/17(Mon)19:53:18","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118580502\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118580502<\/a><br>ok","filename":"018.png","ext":".jpg","w":723,"h":665,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":114,"tim":1490658798042,"time":1490658798,"md5":"wqyDps712G8z6eG+JNjTsg==","fsize":111360,"resto":118580502,"id":"\/GAFMcvf","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":118581788,"now":"03\/27\/17(Mon)19:55:16","name":"Anonymous","com":"<span class=\"quote\">&gt;approval ratings<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;polls<\/span><br>Just like those pre-election night polls right?<br>do they really think anyone trust this shit?","time":1490658916,"resto":118580502,"id":"A8k7YRDk","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":118581839,"now":"03\/27\/17(Mon)19:55:44","name":"Anonymous","com":"NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO<br><br>HOW COULD THIS HAPPEN TO US?","filename":"FD","ext":".jpg","w":512,"h":599,"tn_w":106,"tn_h":125,"tim":1490658944762,"time":1490658944,"md5":"O7TsiaN69ZeaMoVwO8rAHw==","fsize":41165,"resto":118580502,"id":"nk3lQiS1","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":118582023,"now":"03\/27\/17(Mon)19:57:17","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118580502\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118580502<\/a><br>(((polls)))<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Muh 99% chance<\/span><br><br>The only people falling for that shit anymore are the same cucked faggots who fell for it in the first place.","time":1490659037,"resto":118580502,"id":"H8TB+RDY","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":118582025,"now":"03\/27\/17(Mon)19:57:20","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118581788\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118581788<\/a><br>The polls were right though, Drumpftard.

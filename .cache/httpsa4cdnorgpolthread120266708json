Rule by Assad is obviously the best thing for stability in Syria, but, depending on what he does next of course, I doubt he&#039;s going to go and do another Iraq, Afghanistan or Libya. However, he can&#039;t not do something. By striking out against Assad and condemning him he is pleasing a lot of liberals, neo cons and lefties around the world. This probably isn&#039;t too bad a move. If they see him as being better than Obama in this regard, they&#039;ll turn down the hate a little, and it helps him to unify the country. He has also blown the whole Russia collusion thing off the water, which can only be a good thing. By trying to bring NeoCons and liberals into the fold, they&#039;ll look on his more right wing policies and actions much more favourably, and help him bring together the country.<br>And I don&#039;t think there has been that big a &quot;U-turn&quot; by members of \/pol\/. Gassing children is pretty horrific, and Trump hasn&#039;t ordered an invasion or anything.

When i first joined it was almost exclusively white with a strong sense of nationalism and warrior culture. The hardest cunts were trained by hard cunts from vietnam who were trained by korean and ww2 vets. But the army isnt free of all the pc bullshit. In my last few years there was a push to get women in infantry but only for political reasons. There was no shortage of infantry soldiers there was a shortage of places to send them.

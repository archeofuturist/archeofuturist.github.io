Your beliefs are not a basis for degeneracy it is a base right. Forcing any of your beliefs on others which violates their right to have their own beliefs is what degeneracy is. This is why we are not degenerate. We would rather have a good debate (and destroy you in that debate granted but a debate nonetheless). Leftists would rather force you to agree with them by saying you are a racist\/sexist\/nazi\/fascist\/whatever<wbr> unless you agree with them. See the difference? We let you have your belief and show you where you are wrong about it but we still let you make up your mind to accept the truth or not. You try to keep anyone from having any belief other than your own. Ours is the definition of civility and yours is the definition of anarchy.

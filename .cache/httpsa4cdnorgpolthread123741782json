If you eat junk food shit only and are not able to make at least three pasta, three rice and three potato based meals you are part of the problem. <br><br>It is really easy, I&#039;d not say I&#039;m talented but I still don&#039;t even need recipes. Everybody can make a salad, some marinated chicken and rice. Everybody can make pasta, some tuna and onions \/ garlic. Everbody can make a simple potato casserole with ground meat and potatoes. <br><br>IT IS SIMPLE.<br><br>This stuff is so much healthier for you, won&#039;t make you as fat and you will get rid of your addiction for refined sugars. <br><br>Again: Don&#039;t even talk about resisting porn when you are still eating junk food. This shit is fucking up your life big time.<br><br>Also: Cooking has class and is a skill a good man should have. Keep women out of the kitchen. Cooking is a man&#039;s job (see: best chefs in the world are male).","filename":"37F9302400000578-0-image-a-2_1473167627389","ext":".jpg","w":636,"h":358,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":140,"tim":1493710021334,"time":1493710021,"md5":"ZX5y1PxD0t1Db4rXzTwxUQ==","fsize":37377,"resto":0,"id":"Fr8BaVRR","country":"DE","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"if-you-cant-cook-you-are-degenerate","country_name":"Germany","replies":24,"images":6,"unique_ips":14},{"no":123741837,"now":"05\/02\/17(Tue)03:28:02","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123741782\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123741782<\/a><br><br>Blimey.<br><br>They have some big stomachs those Americans.","filename":"1482160694713","ext":".png","w":1280,"h":719,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":70,"tim":1493710082242,"time":1493710082,"md5":"YAZIlpyO4sDUjKhmUBHkdA==","fsize":837698,"resto":123741782,"id":"Z4sCVrLa","country":"GB","m_img":1,"country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":123742343,"now":"05\/02\/17(Tue)03:35:21","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123741837\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123741837<\/a><br>I can&#039;t fathom how one can get so fat.","time":1493710521,"resto":123741782,"id":"Fr8BaVRR","country":"DE","country_name":"Germany"},{"no":123742409,"now":"05\/02\/17(Tue)03:36:27","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123741782\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123741782<\/a><br>This","time":1493710587,"resto":123741782,"id":"Noe\/zSzL","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":123743151,"now":"05\/02\/17(Tue)03:47:33","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123741782\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123741782<\/a><br>Hello wildcats,<br>Does cooking with a microwave count?<br>https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=7hF<wbr>41qPkJxs","filename":"weber-cooks","ext":".jpg","w":565,"h":350,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":77,"tim":1493711253506,"time":1493711253,"md5":"RVN8h1\/UES6g5gx1LByfrg==","fsize":53689,"resto":123741782,"id":"N4uO86g3","country":"FR","country_name":"France"},{"no":123743193,"now":"05\/02\/17(Tue)03:48:09","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123742343\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123742343<\/a><br>It looks pretty easy","filename":"pizza","ext":".webm","w":854,"h":480,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":70,"tim":1493711289510,"time":1493711289,"md5":"Go1PtO\/jd2gYRDTekRRHyg==","fsize":585795,"resto":123741782,"id":"N4uO86g3","country":"FR","country_name":"France"},{"no":123743238,"now":"05\/02\/17(Tue)03:48:55","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123741782\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123741782<\/a><br>Post guides OP.

There are arguments for both sides but large percentages that appear in articles everyday from what I&#039;ve read rest on the assumption that AI will surpass human levels rapidly, as well robotics being in such state of the art that they&#039;ll have near human like dexterity, there&#039;s also the lump of labour fallacy to keep in mind. I&#039;d estimate that recent strides in machine learning will impact say 10% of jobs in the service sector and that manufacturing jobs will continue to go.

In the time since, the amount and aggression of shills has fluctuated, but almost always peaks when there is a happening, interesting\/important info leaks, when Trump scores a victory, or when he suffers a &quot;loss&quot; (for Kek&#039;s chosen has indeed not taken a true loss since becoming President, possibly not since he began running).<br><br>The purpose of shilling is to discourage, frustrate, confuse, and in the odd case troll. I am going to break down the kinds of shills we are encountering, their motivations, and most importantly WHY NONE OF THEIR ARGUMENTS MATTER. If you find this post worthy, bump. If you don&#039;t see merit, ignore. I will break this down into several posts.","filename":"trump pepe","ext":".png","w":300,"h":300,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":250,"tim":1490563377935,"time":1490563377,"md5":"W7LBMbtOpx7Yl7SNn3fJZA==","fsize":94246,"resto":0,"id":"6r1TGBZC","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"on-shills","country_name":"United States","replies":3,"images":2,"unique_ips":2},{"no":118418009,"now":"03\/26\/17(Sun)17:25:00","name":"Anonymous","com":"60% of shills are \/pol\/lacks impersonating shills for &gt;(you)s, 30% are newfags or the_donald fags who don&#039;t understand board culture, and 10% are actually people with an agenda.","time":1490563500,"resto":118417748,"id":"wW2QQixn","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":118418112,"now":"03\/26\/17(Sun)17:25:46","name":"Anonymous","com":"THE KINDS OF SHILLS Pt. 1\/2<br><br>1) Trolls<br>2) NeverTrumpers\/liberals, basically all those who supported other candidates from the start<br>3)The unfaithful, who have been fooled by the shills or their own cynicism and turned their backs on Trump<br>4) Spooks and their paid grunts (ShariahBlue, CTR, etc)<br><br>Trolls are just seeking attention and amusement and want nothing other than to get a rise out of other anons (we all do this sometimes, if we are truthful). The only valid way to handle trolls is to ignore them. Without reward, most will stop putting in the effort. They are a bother, but they mean no real harm and are not much of a threat. They are also usually quite obvious.<br><br>Those who never liked Trump from the start can have some different motivations, but they all shill out of a genuine dislike, sometimes even hatred, for Kek&#039;s chosen prophet. They are either buttblasted by Trump&#039;s easy grab of the presidency and his stellar performance thus far, or they are tards who believe the MSM and think he is a colossal failure. Regardless, they post to try to get more anons on their side, to burst the Trump-supporter&#039;s bubble, and they pounce on anything that looks like a loss for Trump or any opportunity to point out a flaw in him or his administration. You can try to reason and argue with them if you want, but it will likely be fruitless. The truth is out there for all who seek it, and we are under no obligation to educate the willfully ignorant. Pity them, for they know not what they do.","filename":"battle pepe","ext":".png","w":657,"h":527,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":100,"tim":1490563546957,"time":1490563546,"md5":"Y7hWDobrKuU2OyY8mwLLIg==","fsize":171919,"resto":118417748,"id":"6r1TGBZC","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":118418369,"now":"03\/26\/17(Sun)17:27:38","name":"Anonymous","com":"THE KINDS OF SHILLS Pt 1\/2<br><br>The unfaithful are those who began as Trump supporters and were brought down by shilling and the MSM (Is the MSM not merely another conduit for shilling? So Kek has said, so it must be, peace be upon him). These anons likely had a weak faith to begin with. Although discussion and reasoning can sometimes bring them around, again, it is not our obligation. If their faith is true and they are only having a brief lapse, then Trump&#039;s mastery of 13th-dimensional chess (as with the recent healthcare &quot;flop,&quot; parading Romney around, etc) and our own strength and comradeship will rekindle the flame.<br><br>Spooks and their lackeys are the trickiest of the heathens. Kek has revealed to us that our most sacred board has become a testing ground for their psyops. They try to instill doubt in our God Emperor, mock him, belittle him. They steal our memes and try to turn them back on us. They know fully what they do, they are paid to do it, and they are consistently trying to perfect their craft. They see Trump and us as a threat. Reasoning and arguing will not work; their words are empty and meant only to confuse and deceive. They succeed by convincing or distracting us, both of which require us to give them attention. Deny them their (You)s. Let their blasphemies fall on deaf ears. Let them wonder if their schemes are succeeding or failing as they try to interpret their lack of responses.","filename":"pepe army","ext":".png","w":657,"h":527,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":100,"tim":1490563658813,"time":1490563658,"md5":"huNf1zcR6stE68+aF0tMiw==","fsize":175014,"resto":118417748,"id":"6r1TGBZC","country":"US","country_name":"United States"}]}

I&#039;ve got some insider info on our war plans from intel section friends. I can&#039;t tell everything ofc but I can at least give you some reassurance. Yes, we will be there ASAP when the war breaks out; yes, Seoul will be ok, thanks to our really efficient counter-battery-fire techniques we&#039;ve been developing in Afghan; and no, the Norks won&#039;t be able to nuke shit. We have THAAD missiles set up, which can intercept any attempted missile launch with estimated kill ratio of 85-90% per THAAD interceptor. And SM-3 missiles off the Aegis cruisers of 7th Fleet will be able to do the same if they&#039;re on station when the war breaks out. All you guys have to do is not die for around a week, and then we&#039;ll get there to help. You and me, amigo, we&#039;re gonna drive straight north until we hit the Yalu.","time":1492977191,"resto":122469722,"id":"mBxI89DR","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":122476326,"now":"04\/23\/17(Sun)15:56:44","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122475673\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122475673<\/a><br><br>Thanks ZOG solider anon.<br>I really appreciate your burger help in my fatherland.","time":1492977404,"resto":122469722,"id":"ARW3XeJ0","country":"KR","country_name":"South Korea"},{"no":122477043,"now":"04\/23\/17(Sun)16:00:57","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122476326\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122476326<\/a><br>np m90, I&#039;d much rather fight to keep Korea great than fight to enact the latest Jewish scheme.

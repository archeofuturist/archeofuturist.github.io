At least I used to think so, but then realised that the average person doesn&#039;t have the capacity for independent thought, much less secular thought based solely on reasoning. We are under the false impression that the feeble peasant is a figure of the past, however, we must realise that only the verbal class distinction has disappeared, not the people which it describes, regardless of better education and more wealth.<br><br>A secular society can only function when there is a strong sense of public duty and personal dignity. Our Western societies are in a state of squalor and filth. If ((they)) had left the West alone, we would perhaps have had a revival of the faith like we have had in previous centuries. Degeneracy and righteousness have the same relationship as chaos and order, yin and yang. They are mutually dependent on each other for existence and fluctuations are norma. However, in the last few decades of secularism a new religion has been introduced, one which is zealous instead of righteous, one which is more zealous now than it was 1000 years ago.<br><br>If there is a revival of faith, our tradition of Christianity will have to compete with a more aggressive faith, one which has the unfair advantage of higher birthrates and unmitigated immigration. Add to this the fact that Christianity has been widely mocked by the popular media, debilitating it in the peasant&#039;s mind, whilst the other faith is impossible to discuss and critique in the West without fear of violence.

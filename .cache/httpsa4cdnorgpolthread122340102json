As a christian i just got back so bear with me but. I had the opportunity to have dinner with a friend who happens to be a atheist, I myself a christian. So goes like this.<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Get there be greeted into a nice home in the backwoods<\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Introduce our self&#039;s we&#039;d known them for some time now a bit over a year gone camping, Shooting etc.<\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;So to make it short we sit down for dinner he tells us your the only 12th people we&#039;ve had in this house and I&#039;ve lived in this house for twenty years he says.<\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;I ask him. Well you must have family, That comes over to visit. He tells me no the other side of my family is all right wingers pushing christian beliefs down our throats.<\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Tells us that i respect peoples, Beliefs and that they can believe what they want to. But don&#039;t push your beliefs on us.<\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;I don&#039;t push the issues as i can see he&#039;s pretty set on his beliefs he&#039;s around 70 i&#039;d say. One thing though he did ask us if we wanted to say grace. But said do it quickly cause we be eating me and my friend both Christians don&#039;t really know what to say so we just have dinner. <\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;After we finish dinner and chit chat about our lives going over past experiences. I go out to shoot with the guy while my other family member goes to hang out with his wife and help groom her pets.<\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;In Conclusion a liberal hippy who btw is a veteran who fought in the Vietnam war is Pro gun, Atheist, leans to the left, is anti drug, and alcohol from his personal experience.<\/span><br><br>So pol have any of you ever had an experience like this i didn&#039;t bring up the religion issue to much cause he seemed pretty set on his beliefs. But if there was one thing i guess i would&#039;ve said probably would be that most christians push their beliefs so that you don&#039;t go to hell when you die cause they love and care for you. But like i said i kept my mouth shut and just had dinner shot some guns out in backwoods.<br><br>So pol have any of you gone into anothers home of diff beliefs and got to know them?","filename":"4D chess","ext":".jpg","w":764,"h":551,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":180,"tim":1492901331591,"time":1492901331,"md5":"RoLRfAw2mLrLTbCMmoTX2A==","fsize":269818,"resto":0,"id":"17xXP8ru","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"dinner-with-an-atheist","country_name":"United States","replies":10,"images":1,"unique_ips":5},{"no":122341221,"now":"04\/22\/17(Sat)18:57:23","name":"SomeTwat","com":"<a href=\"#p122340102\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122340102<\/a><br>My neighbour is a christian, myself an atheist and I&#039;ve noticed the whole wanting to convert me out of compassion for not wanting me to go to hell and whatnot.<br><br>I tend to let it go as there&#039;s good sentiment behind it but I can indeed understand how it can get to people when it becomes so common.<br><br>Overall my neighbours are nice people who are interesting, that&#039;s all that matters really.","time":1492901843,"resto":122340102,"id":"1PSwjb06","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":122341255,"now":"04\/22\/17(Sat)18:57:37","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122340102\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122340102<\/a><br>this is a really shitty story OP","time":1492901857,"resto":122340102,"id":"4SZY\/qTA","country":"FI","country_name":"Finland"},{"no":122341535,"now":"04\/22\/17(Sat)18:59:51","name":"Anonymous","com":"What&#039;s this fella do for a living?","time":1492901991,"resto":122340102,"id":"nJokG4Xm","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":122341632,"now":"04\/22\/17(Sat)19:00:32","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122341255\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122341255<\/a><br>the text limit doesn&#039;t really let me get into too much detail but we&#039;d known him and his family for about a year or two now going on.

Macron was the best candidate on the stage and she wasn&#039;t able to debate.<br><br>When Macron asked her how she would leave the EU, Marine wasn&#039;t able to give a clear answer. Plus, on economic issues, she was terrible. She doesn&#039;t have a clue about economics and Macron was simply better.<br><br>I was for Nicolas Dupont-Aignan, which was the best candidate for the Right in France. He decided to join Le Pen for the second round, now, he looks like an absolute idiot.<br><br>She&#039;ll lose badly in the Second Round. She&#039;s a joke. <br><br>Sad day for France.","filename":"Le Pen","ext":".jpg","w":720,"h":405,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":140,"tim":1493858595055,"time":1493858595,"md5":"jhCy4mTKH2cL1ntxzLcu9g==","fsize":36428,"resto":0,"id":"T5LpoJ+9","country":"CA","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"sorry-guys-this-is-all-over-le-pen-was-terrible","country_name":"Canada","replies":1,"images":0,"unique_ips":2},{"no":123992339,"now":"05\/03\/17(Wed)20:44:24","name":"Anonymous","com":"kike","time":1493858664,"resto":123992217,"id":"ayPLsBOH","country":"US","country_name":"United States"}]}

The same is true for about 40 percent of regional educational centers (ROCs).<br><br>The only parties which did not support the motion were the center-right People&#039;s Party for Freedom and Democracy (VVD), the Christian-right Reformed Political Party (SGP), and the right-wing Forum for Democracy (FvD) party.<br><br>The LGBT-friendly proposal comes after heterosexual Dutch men across the Netherlands and elsewhere held hands with other men earlier this month, in a symbol of solidarity after a hand-holding gay couple was attacked in Arnhem. Images of the movement were posted on social media under the hashtag #allemannenhandinhand (all men, holding hands).","filename":"geert","ext":".jpg","w":1249,"h":1600,"tn_w":195,"tn_h":250,"tim":1492104697624,"time":1492104697,"md5":"XZN9Pe0ZZdwkc0JcyqFpQA==","fsize":248537,"resto":0,"id":"JzjUOfLT","country":"US","m_img":1,"bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"dutch-schools-must-teach-lgbt-awareness","country_name":"United States","replies":3,"images":1,"unique_ips":3},{"no":120935860,"now":"04\/13\/17(Thu)13:35:12","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120935403\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120935403<\/a><br>Shariah soon Kuffar","filename":"Islam","ext":".png","w":420,"h":420,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":125,"tim":1492104912929,"time":1492104912,"md5":"pHZD9y6xQeFa\/7wPNBjBGw==","fsize":9941,"resto":120935403,"id":"Vdl\/PmUk","country":"CA","country_name":"Canada"},{"no":120936026,"now":"04\/13\/17(Thu)13:36:23","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120935403\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120935403<\/a><br>Geert Wilders is a homo.","time":1492104983,"resto":120935403,"id":"aRE\/fcyu","country":"PL","country_name":"Poland"},{"no":120936091,"now":"04\/13\/17(Thu)13:37:01","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120936026\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120936026<\/a><br>I posted his pic because the article said (apparently) his party voted for it.

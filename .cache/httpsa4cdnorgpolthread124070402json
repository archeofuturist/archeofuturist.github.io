The only problem with society is that we started to pretend that women were exactly the same as men, that they were equally capable to men, that they were as wise as men. Turns out that this premise was 100% incorrect. Women can&#039;t be blamed for their nature in the same way children cant. They can&#039;t help what they are. Men are the ones who fucked up by allowing women to make poor decisions under the false notion that they knew what they were doing.

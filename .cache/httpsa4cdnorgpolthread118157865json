Trump gave them a task and they failed it because of in-fighting. now Democrats will wear ever-imploding and hated Obamacare, while Republicans will wear the failure to repeal\/replace it. Trump can say to the people that he tried, but the GOP failed him.<br><br>of course hardcore liberals and never-Trumpers will not change their perspective, but this also doesn&#039;t change the large bulk of the country&#039;s perception of Trump, the Dems fucked them, Trump tried to unfuck them, GOP failed to do its part. <br><br>if anything, this strengthens him. he just put GOP in a position where they either do what he tells them or face the wrath of the electorate. having defied him, they now face a real threat to the party. if having majority they can&#039;t get their shit together and do what they promised the people they will do, they will be replaced by those who can. their only choice now is to do some house-cleaning, unify, fall in line and next time do what God Emperor commands.<br><br>I&#039;m not saying this is 4D chess, but it really isn&#039;t the administration failure mass media is trying to spin it into. in the long run it now actually strengthens Trump the longer Obamacare keeps bleeding the American people.","filename":"trump kek","ext":".jpg","w":1920,"h":1080,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":140,"tim":1490401548635,"time":1490401548,"md5":"2GrBBi0vsTWuw6F4h69YZg==","fsize":297249,"resto":0,"id":"LZk+dLln","country":"CA","m_img":1,"bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"obamacare-surviving-is-not-a-blow-to-trump","country_name":"Canada","replies":12,"images":2,"unique_ips":9},{"no":118158232,"now":"03\/24\/17(Fri)20:28:58","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118157865\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118157865<\/a><br>Becaue Trump is part of the GOP and endorsed the bill.

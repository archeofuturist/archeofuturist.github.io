You must be successful, reliable, hardworking, and, above all, happy. Do people in your life trust and respect you? What does your family think of you? Are you capable of raising children? Racial politics doesn\u2019t have to be the only factor of your life. And if you can&#039;t achieve these things in your real life, then you are not ready to be a political activist, either online or in real life. Because if you can&#039;t make anything of your own, individual life, then how can you think you&#039;ll be able to make a real difference for the race, for the lives of many?<br><br>Always remember: we live in first world countries and have opportunity that most people born on this planet don&#039;t. Things aren\u2019t as good for us as they were for our parents. But billions of people in the third world would still kill to have the opportunity that you do right now. So take care of yourself! Work your ass off, every day, to build a good life for you, and for your family. Spend your time wisely, and keep your real life priorities in order. Work hard, but also do fun and wholesome things with real people in real life. That is very important. Nothing on the internet should ever take away from your real life.","filename":"1490564700478","ext":".jpg","w":848,"h":848,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":250,"tim":1493859834278,"time":1493859834,"md5":"gPesuc4ElpdVRkH\/20FTWQ==","fsize":83207,"resto":0,"id":"NP\/uN0dc","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"the-most-important-thing-you-can-do-for-the-white","country_name":"United States","replies":16,"images":2,"unique_ips":10},{"no":123994980,"now":"05\/03\/17(Wed)21:07:44","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123994554\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123994554<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;the white race<\/span><br>What has &#039;the white race&#039; ever done for me ? nothing, so whatever I do will be for my own benefit.","time":1493860064,"resto":123994554,"id":"My3d0swD","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":123995254,"now":"05\/03\/17(Wed)21:09:51","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123994980\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123994980<\/a><br>You must go back to plebbit.","time":1493860191,"resto":123994554,"id":"gwFuyOud","country":"CA","country_name":"Canada"},{"no":123995353,"now":"05\/03\/17(Wed)21:10:45","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123994554\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123994554<\/a><br>how the fuck can i be any of those things? my parents were poor, mom a bipolar drug addict and alcoholic, my dad just didnt give a shit.<br><br>i studied my ass off, got a math degree + experience in uni, all paid for by student loans, and could only get a basic analyst job in advertising for 35k \/ year. i can barely pay my bills, let alone buy nice things or start a family. fuck you.","time":1493860245,"resto":123994554,"id":"q29TCSwE","country":"CA","country_name":"Canada"},{"no":123995576,"now":"05\/03\/17(Wed)21:12:30","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123995353\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123995353<\/a><br><br>What you&#039;re doing isn&#039;t working and you need to do something different.

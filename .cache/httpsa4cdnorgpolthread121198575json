I have a solar array with a self-made device for remotely removing debris or snow from the panels, connected to a tesla powerwall. From ground level you can&#039;t see the solar array from any angle, and I have traps in the area surrounding the array. That&#039;s in one corner of the lot. Then I have my bunker which is fully furnished, fully supplied. I have numerous exits, the furthest being 350 yards from the bunker in an interesting location so I can access the bunker in the winter without being tracked. I have FLIR cameras positioned so I have a 360 degree view of my surroundings, with overlapping views so if one camera breaks then the others will cover for it. Connected to my bunker through an service tunnel is a large &quot;warehouse&quot; with water treatment, a well, rows of vertical farms with seeds, nutrients, lights, fans, and several replacements of each part if anything were to break down. This entire warehouse is underground, with its own exit. I have fire extinguishers, smoke detectors, carbon monoxide detectors, a fully stocked medical cabinet with manuals for any surgery and operation. I have televisions, computers, board games, a library, plus lifetimes of movies, television shows, and video games. <br><br>I&#039;d like to set up a long-range wireless network so I can pipe the internet into my bunker, but it would be a hassle, it might compromise my bunker&#039;s network, and it might allow a very tech savvy individual to have a rough idea as to where my bunker is. It&#039;s cozy for sure. I&#039;ve spent months in the bunker at a time, doing maintenance and doing test runs. There&#039;s a good chance I&#039;ll get an early warning if things are about to go south, and I never stray more than 50 miles from my house. I&#039;ve got a vehicle with security on par with the presidential limo, a CC license and weapons in the vehicle if I have to persuade anyone while en route to the bunker.","time":1492261913,"resto":121198575,"id":"aCkL4ziv","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":121209119,"now":"04\/15\/17(Sat)09:15:38","name":"Anonymous","com":"Pretty set, also - have 5 months food @ 3 meals a day and 8 months drinking water stored @ 4 Ltrs each\/per day. 200oz silver, 1.9oz Gold, \u00a3600 cash and shelter etc in the bug out bags, flash bangs and alarm mines (blank firing) etc. A 4x4 and spare fuel for another 300 miles","filename":"IMG_3526","ext":".jpg","w":3194,"h":3024,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":118,"tim":1492262138812,"time":1492262138,"md5":"DGLFpA07nxWzcq8sj2w50A==","fsize":1693289,"resto":121198575,"id":"r0JL4pXz","country":"GB","m_img":1,"country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":121209163,"now":"04\/15\/17(Sat)09:16:08","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121202111\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121202111<\/a><br><a href=\"#p121201556\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121201556<\/a><br><a href=\"#p121200878\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121200878<\/a><br>very based posts.<br>you&#039;re not alone.<br>i know youre completely right.","filename":"slow zoom","ext":".gif","w":400,"h":373,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":116,"tim":1492262168966,"time":1492262168,"md5":"nCtk8pymRTBS7dzT4jbw2Q==","fsize":4037371,"resto":121198575,"id":"evw8bo2F","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":121209344,"now":"04\/15\/17(Sat)09:18:30","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121198703\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121198703<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;gun<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;in Germany<\/span><br>Hahahahahahaha<br><br>He can&#039;t even carry that knife in public legally.","filename":"IMG_0002","ext":".jpg","w":500,"h":520,"tn_w":120,"tn_h":125,"tim":1492262310283,"time":1492262310,"md5":"uAriuwPDB1skAhR5xFmoWA==","fsize":59533,"resto":121198575,"id":"Qm0l2KRZ","country":"DE","country_name":"Germany"},{"no":121209773,"now":"04\/15\/17(Sat)09:23:26","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121198575\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121198575<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Too poor to prepare for anything.<\/span><br>What do \/pol? advise me anything.","time":1492262606,"resto":121198575,"id":"GQULPDUp","country":"LT","country_name":"Lithuania"},{"no":121210062,"now":"04\/15\/17(Sat)09:26:51","name":"Anonymous","com":"I&#039;d say that you could survive for 4 days without doing too much but your main issue will be defence, look at gen 3 grenades (civilian use) pin pulled and could be modified (if someone was looking into that) get some gold, respirator (CBRN).

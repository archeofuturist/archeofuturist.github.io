In 1492, China was the world&#039;s superpower, the center of world trade which nations far and wide were dying to get to. China had already explored half the world (at least as far as South Africa) almost a century before Columbus (the voyages of Zheng He).

No one in Asia took Europeans as anything but minor peddlers who didnt bathe and frothed at the mouth about their religious fanaticism. China looked down on Europe as backwards people, obsessed with slavery and superstition (China has been atheist for a long time).

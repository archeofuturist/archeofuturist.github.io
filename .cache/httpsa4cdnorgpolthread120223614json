When the Jew came to me, it explained everything about what is to come: the battles, the conquests, the glory! Do you really think I would have done any less myself, had I lived long enough? So what if the shortsighted people of your time curse my name, so long as they are my slaves? But enough of this... My destiny awaits!

Forgive me Dahnald, but I cannot allow your nightmare to become my reality.<br>(Ted shoots and kills Donald Trump.)<br>Ted: I feel the tug of the time vortex... pulling... me... back.

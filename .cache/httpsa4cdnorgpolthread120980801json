They&#039;re not designed to be launched. Their nukes are never going to put on top of a rocket. They&#039;re never going inside a submarine. These devices are being put on the backs of trucks, and these trucks are being sent into South Korea -- deep under the surface -- in tunnels. These shafts are being made all the time, dug by slave labour and army conscripts. They penetrate deep into the South&#039;s territory. Miles and miles, and there&#039;s so many of them. The US and the South are finding them all the time, they&#039;ll destroy them without much fanfare - because for every one they locate and destroy, who knows how many others have gotten past? There are two levels (literally) to these tunnels. The shallower ones, closer to the surface, are for smuggling things in and out, moving people, that sort of thing. But the deeper ones are the killer. Those are the ones designed for placing a nuke two miles beneath the middle of Seoul.

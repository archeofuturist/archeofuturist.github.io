For the record, I&#039;m white, was born in new Orleans in 97 (moving away shortly after my birth before moving back a bit before Katrina). I actually went back last year for Mardi gras for the first time in a decade. Makes every parade seem worthless in comparison and I&#039;ve seen all the big Manhattan ones.<br><br>First, you have to set a backdrop. Literally every few months there would be a report of a horrible hurricane coming, and nothing would happen every time. We would evacuate to (a place I&#039;ll get to in a moment), stay overnight, and come back after literally nothing happened except some heavy rain.<br><br>So here comes Katrina, and my dad says fuck it, we&#039;re not going. We lived right to Audubon park (google it, but basically imagine a big park with bike paths, a lake, and golf courses). Sidenote, but I actually learned to ride a bike there. Like six year olds, I just took off and rode all the way around and looped my walking parents. Completely insane now that I look back on it. Anyway, hear about this hurricane, no big deal right? I remember my mom and I taking some bread and going to Audubon to feed the ducks.<br><br>I still remember that eery feeling. I didn&#039;t know the word at the time, but lovecraftian was the only one to describe it. This was a park that could compete with Manhattan&#039;s Central park in human density if not area, and it was completely silent and still. The wild was slowly picking up, and as a small child it felt like being roughly shoved. It was so hauntingly calm and we just kept walking and could not find a single duck. Then I remember a man approaching us, dressed as a cop. I can&#039;t even remember his face or anything else, but he said that we needed to get indoors and hopefully leave the city.

Real smart guy, says this hurricane is bad, talks for half an hour and convinces my dad that we need to evacuate. Funnily enough, our house wasn&#039;t touched, we got back a month later and got everything before leaving. Except for the fridge, of course. The fridge was a real tragedy because we had just picked like 20 pounds of blueberries. You ever smell 20 pounds of rotten blueberries? I haven&#039;t either, but judging by my parents refusal to let me get close, it wasn&#039;t pretty.<br><br>So, we head out to this hospital, go to sleep.<br>I&#039;m waken very early by one of my parents, I can&#039;t remember which, says we have to move. The hospital had one of those automatic double doors, and there was literally a foot of water slowly gushing in through it. <br>So, we run up stairs and by the end of the day, the water was up to the tops of the houses. I remember people talking about the hospital being completely fucked, and they had just put in a bunch of new equipment. I didn&#039;t check later, but I&#039;m pretty sure the hospital closed. My dad was pissed because he had just bought a new car (well technically used), it wasn&#039;t insured, and we weren&#039;t as well off those days. I&#039;m pretty sure the cell towers got fucked too, I remember everyone standing on the roof with their shitty little fliphones trying to get a signal. I roamed the upper floors of that hospital, I&#039;m sure I could draw a map from memory, but it would be a child&#039;s map: the dimensions all wrong. I can&#039;t remember what we ate, not sure if my parents packed or not. I did learn that you could make some great fucking balloons out of latex gloves. There was one nurse (doctor?) who was a master and taught me how to do it.

As I said before, dropping the baby and having to dive after it was the running joke in the hospital. I was too young to distinguish between true or false, but I think it was true. We finally got on a boat and went to a prison which had been made into a makeshift hospital. I was shielded to this by my youth, but with the power failures and general trauma, I&#039;m sure a lot of patients died. So, I&#039;m following my dad running around this prison trying to administer medicine. Finally another boat comes, and I lose track of the number of boats at this time. I do remember riding along the tops of street lights. Waters been going down this whole team, and we get to a place where we get sweatshirts with the world new Orleans in pink lettering. I remember being torn between having this trophy and wearing something subtlety pink. I think it was just a gutted store that we were legally robbing, overseen by the police or whatever. I remember shelves. More boat rides. We finally get out, and I remember it being night. There were volunteering driving buses to shuttle people out of the city. I remember being giving some subway knockoff sandwich, but I was so hungry I didn&#039;t care. <br><br>Last post coming up.","time":1490365517,"resto":118079777,"id":"uX8SB2JL","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":118085274,"now":"03\/24\/17(Fri)10:25:37","name":"Anonymous","com":"Also op<br><br>Bush was warned of Levi breaks and ignored it.<br><br>Cheney took power repairmen off of trying to get hospitals back up to work on the oil line which had been damaged.<br><br>And after Michael brown left office, he said the reason FEMA didn&#039;t respond correctly was because the republicans said they wanted to punish the governor who was a white female democrat.<br><br>In short op, don&#039;t ask pol for serious answers.

You are thinking of &quot;Fully automatic rifle,&quot; and in the US, fully automatic firearms created after 1986 are not only banned from use or ownership, the pre-86 guns require a special registration with the Fed to be legal. In addition the owner is required to pay a tax stamp fee (which is considerable), and the scarcity of pre-86 fully automatic firearms is such that even the most basic of such firearms start at about $10000 and only climbs upward, making such firearms unavailable to anyone not rich or dedicated enough to obtain them.<br><br>Semi-automatic firearms, which are what most (legal) gun owners are purchasing, fire only one round per trigger pull. This means that an AR-15 and your daddy&#039;s hunting rifle have about the same rate of fire, assuming that both are semi-automatic firearms.

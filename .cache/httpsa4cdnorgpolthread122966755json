Another senate bill authored by the same pair of ambitious religious freedom fighters would allow people employed in any of Texas&#039;s 65 licensed occupations to refuse service to people if those folks violate their SHRB.<br><br>So, for example, private medical providers wouldn&#039;t really have to help trans patients if they assert that being transgender violates their SHRB; barbers wouldn&#039;t have to cut gay people&#039;s hair if they didn&#039;t feel like it; plumbers could let toilets overflow and electricians could keep people in the dark if they happened to religiously disagree with the customer&#039;s sexual orientation. And the bill would prohibit the state from disciplining them for any of this.<br><br>Other bills allow wedding-industry businesses, such as cake makers and florists, to refuse service to LGBT couples (HB 2876 by Rep. Scott Sanford), allow &quot;conscientious refusal&quot; of healthcare services of any kind based moral beliefs (HB 2878 by Sanford) and allow child welfare service providers to refuse to take in LGBT kids (SB 892\u2014also by Senator Perry).<br><br>None of these bills has made significant headway in the Lege, at least not yet. The so-called bathroom bill, SB 6, has passed in the Senate, but its future is far less certain in the house. A House substitute, HB 2899, is less restrictive than SB 6 and does not include provisions about requiring school districts and cities to enforce bathroom bills based on biological sex, but prohibits jurisdictions from passing trans-inclusive bathroom policies. Which, to the LGBT community, is not much better.","filename":"protests","ext":".jpg","w":745,"h":559,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":187,"tim":1493253652100,"time":1493253652,"md5":"WUe20+E8dSZEYIQROa47HQ==","fsize":124520,"resto":0,"id":"d1Sf++8t","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"texas-attempts-to-pass-a-dozen-antigay-religious","country_name":"United States","replies":152,"images":12,"unique_ips":68,"tail_size":50},{"no":122966903,"now":"04\/26\/17(Wed)20:41:56","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122966755\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122966755<\/a><br>if we allow full religious freedom then this must pass<br>otherwise its b\/s discrimination against christians","time":1493253716,"resto":122966755,"id":"OUV\/Os8h","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":122967117,"now":"04\/26\/17(Wed)20:43:32","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122966903\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122966903<\/a><br>Discrimination against Christians is prohibited by federal law.","time":1493253812,"resto":122966755,"id":"d1Sf++8t","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":122967159,"now":"04\/26\/17(Wed)20:43:52","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122966903\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122966903<\/a><br>WE WUZ OPPRESSED N SHIET","time":1493253832,"resto":122966755,"id":"CzhcWPn+","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":122967357,"now":"04\/26\/17(Wed)20:45:22","name":"Anonymous","com":"Only an authoritarian would want to limit someone&#039;s right to discriminate people.","time":1493253922,"resto":122966755,"id":"6FWFS5Sl","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":122967845,"now":"04\/26\/17(Wed)20:48:42","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122966755\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122966755<\/a><br><br>I don&#039;t agree with state clerks being given the right to discriminate.

If Christians have to do duties that violate their morality you are being prejudice by not allowing them to refuse that task and let someone perform it.","time":1493257625,"resto":122966755,"id":"d\/2vueXm","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":122975872,"now":"04\/26\/17(Wed)21:49:18","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122974702\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122974702<\/a><br>Assuming you are being genuine rather than simply positioning yourself as opposition for laughs:<br><br>There is nothing in current SCOTUS jurisprudence which could remotely support someone refusing to serve someone because they go to a different church. That you would use this as an example reveals just how much you do not understand the present question regarding SHB.I&#039;ll do what I can to help you understand.<br><br>The first major factor is that this is a government job, meaning it would specifically be the government forcing the clerk to act against their SHB. This evokes concerns about a first amendment violation given the &quot;state actor&quot; element. Next, admonishing homosexuality has been a major tenant of many religions for at least the past century, with historical evidence placing it back significantly further. This is not some arbitrary feeling, nor would a court view it as such. Compare this to your &quot;because they&#039;re white\/don&#039;t go to my church&quot; thing. The former is entirely arbitrary and racial, specifically prohibited by statutes passed by Congress. The latter is not sincere or fundamental to their practice of religion. Finally, it is likely that many people serving as marriage clerks began working prior to Obergefell. This means that it is likely they did not expect to marry gay couples when they took their job. Homosexuals traditionally and historically have not been part of the institution of marriage. For some it might not matter, but for others it would be both unfair and infringing upon their rights to compel them to marry.<br><br>Finally, to wrap it all up, the SCOTUS has acknowledged that freedom from government interference with religious practices which do not violate valid statutes are fundamental, while gay marriage is not. This would mean the courts would likely afford significantly higher deference to the religious liberties of the clerk when pushed against by the liberty for gays to marry.","time":1493257758,"resto":122966755,"id":"n+TV2xTQ","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":122976140,"now":"04\/26\/17(Wed)21:51:13","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122966755\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122966755<\/a><br><br>kek I helped draft one of these model bills<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;timmy &quot;not in my day care faggot&quot; thicc<\/span>","time":1493257873,"resto":122966755,"id":"kqawWCL7","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":122976171,"now":"04\/26\/17(Wed)21:51:31","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122975872\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122975872<\/a><br>So when all the politicians who got jobs before Obergefell die, gays will finally know peace?

Some Palm Beach businesses are suffering as a result of frequent Trump visits too. For example, the New York Times reported that private businesses at the Palm Beach County Park Airport have to shut down due to flight restrictions imposed by the U.S. Secret Service.<\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Trump&#039;s trips to Mar-a-Lago have also spurred controversy due to the ethical concerns they raise. It\u2019s expected for a president to find a place to escape for leisure and meetings, but unlike past presidents, Trump is retreating to a resort that he owns and profits from. Every visit is essentially free publicity on a global scale for Mar-a-Lago and Trump&#039;s business interests.<\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Trump, who bought Mar-a-Lago in the 1980s, announced before he took office that his son, Donald Trump, Jr., would become director of the resort. However, by not placing his assets in a blind trust, Trump has not fully divested from his real estate empire and businesses. Some critics have accused Trump of seeking personal financial gain by promoting Mar-a-Lago as a frequent spot for his high-profile meetings as president.<\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;TIME reports Trump made nearly $30 million by running Mar-a-Lago in 2015. And the resort could reap far higher revenues going forward: After Trump won the 2016 election, initiative fees for members were doubled to a staggering $200,000.<\/span><br><br>Quite sad.<br><br>And as you can see, you could easily make the argument that not only is Trump draining tax payer money on the very thing he accused his predecessor on doing, he is also profiting off his own presidency.<br><br>&quot;At least he&#039;s paying for it with his own money&quot;.

Common sense tells us that they reject the accusation of being Ochlocratic, but not what arguments they deploy, if they even think it necessary to reply to the charge. The charge was originally described as a &#039;popular misconception&#039; (or some similar expression), but that seems unlikely, partly because Ochlocratic (as distinct from &#039;mob rule&#039;) is not a word in most people&#039;s vocabulary, and Anarchism is not a subject that greatly occupies most people&#039;s minds, and partly because the term &#039;anarchy&#039; conjures up in most people&#039;s minds many problems far worse than mere mob rule, such as tyranny by local bandits or warlords, economic collapse followed by starvation, and so on. So anarchists may not necessarily feel any great need to answer that particular charge. And if they do answer it, they would quite likely avoid incomprehensible waffle about &#039;theories of structure and mutual support rooted in democracy and free association&#039; in favour of something much simpler such as &#039;we anarchists object to being ruled, so what makes you think we are trying to get ourselves ruled by mobs?&#039;. And that is what I would probably say if I were an anarchist (I&#039;m not).","filename":"m448","ext":".jpg","w":1237,"h":940,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":189,"tim":1493369856017,"time":1493369856,"md5":"ibcAbhBJh74InIVn2dPtsg==","fsize":298886,"resto":0,"id":"FbwbFaEg","country":"CA","m_img":1,"bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"hitler-was-no-anarchist-but-was-he-an-ochlocrat","country_name":"Canada","replies":0,"images":0,"unique_ips":1}]}

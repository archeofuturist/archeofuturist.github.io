The true leader is Kadyrov and he&#039;s milking Putin as a nice cash cow. Russian economy is based on export of oil and gas. Third or Russian GDP is based on oil and gas. Under Putin&#039;s reign Russia started the gas and oil export which caused a large boost of economy and increase in life quality for many Russians. Putin pays Kadyrov to keep Chechnya calm and he pay a lot. Using Putin&#039;s oil and gas money Kadyrov has rebuilt Grozny and made it even better than prewar: skyscrapers, smooth roads, one of the biggest mosques in Europe. <br>To keep Chechnya calm money is not enough, occasionally Russians have to kiss the hairy Muslim ass. Article 282 of Russian constitution prohibits &quot;offending the dignity of a person based on racial or religious identity&quot;. Which means any white Slavic Russian person who speaks against mudslimes and Chechen might go to prison. Using this Putin can silence people and keep Chechen from chimping out. The Pussy Riot incident was a great deception, it was used to justify putting people in prison for offending religious believers, &quot;see simple Ivan it&#039;s about feelings of religious people so it should apply to everyone including Muslims.&quot; When Charlie Hebdo attack happened there were demonstration in Grozny, a great reminder why it&#039;s necessary for Putin to silence anyone who&#039;s against islamization of Europe and Russia. For now the only thing that controls Chechnya is money, if the cashflow stops or Kadyrov&#039;s clan gets overthrown Russia will face a devastating war.","time":1492475215,"resto":121582317,"id":"iAWC0fR+","country":"US","country_name":"United States"}]}

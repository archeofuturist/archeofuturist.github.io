This inquiry took place over the last two years:<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;A public inquiry began on 27 January 2015,[10] and concluded in January 2016 that Litvinenko&#039;s murder was an FSB operation, that was probably personally approved by Vladimir Putin.[11]<\/span><br>https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Alexa<wbr>nder_Litvinenko<br><br>So basically, a British high court judge has ruled that the President of Russia, Vladimir Putin, probably ordered an extra-judicial killing on British soil. Theresa May acknowledged these findings in parliament, so I guess the official line of the British government is that the Russian government is most likely responsible for this killing.","time":1492468258,"resto":121582317,"id":"7AnMtUZQ","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":121594431,"now":"04\/17\/17(Mon)18:37:07","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121592029\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121592029<\/a><br><a href=\"#p121592790\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121592790<\/a><br>Maybe he just didn&#039;t want to be a lapdog cuck to Putin?<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;litvinenko latter converted to islam<\/span><br>Source: your ass<br><br>Anyway you are a gigantic cuck faggot for supporting Putin, just so you know that.","time":1492468627,"resto":121582317,"id":"7AnMtUZQ","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":121594659,"now":"04\/17\/17(Mon)18:38:56","name":"Anonymous","com":"Guy was at his hotel and during breakfast he was poisoned with polonium that secret agents put on his tea.","time":1492468736,"resto":121582317,"id":"wefSz5SM","country":"AL","country_name":"Albania"},{"no":121594711,"now":"04\/17\/17(Mon)18:39:23","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121593254\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121593254<\/a><br>The Tories overspending their campaign allowance?

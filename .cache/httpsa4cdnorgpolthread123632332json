And you&#039;re right, social networking is huge. I can&#039;t count the number of friends I made or girls I hooked up with by meeting them through a friend. <br><br>Just be upbeat and positive, don&#039;t be a downer, don&#039;t be the guy that always has something negative to say or else no one will want to be around you. Be positive, be funny or friendly, and all you need to do is make one good socially competent friend and they can open doors for you. Invite you to parties, take you out for activities, whatever. Just always say YES when you&#039;re invited to do something. Don&#039;t make excuses. <br><br>As far as having to jockey for status or entertain women or whatever, it just depends. There are plenty of introverted women out there who are just as content to sit at home cuddling on the couch watching Netflix with you as there are women who want to go out and party every night. Just find one who&#039;s compatible, it&#039;s not hard to figure out which way they lean. If she&#039;s too into the social scene then detach yourself from her immediately and continue the hunt for a better one. <br><br>As for claiming you&#039;re ugly - I&#039;ve found throughout life that we&#039;re our own worst critics. We tend to exaggerate our failures and shortcomings more than anyone else would. Maybe you aren&#039;t great looking, but you&#039;re probably at least slightly better looking than you believe you are. Plus some girls just have really weird kinks or they&#039;ll overlook a lot of shit if you have one singular thing they&#039;re into. Doesn&#039;t matter if you have big ears, crooked teeth, too much body hair, short, a bit overweight, lanky, too skinny, whatever, there&#039;ll be girls that either don&#039;t mind certain things, or like you more for them for whatever reason. Just try not to be super overweight, that&#039;s like the one that brings the most grief from what I&#039;ve observed, but even that can be fixed through time and hardwork.","time":1493653229,"resto":123632332,"id":"APUCfJEb","country":"CA","country_name":"Canada"},{"no":123634400,"now":"05\/01\/17(Mon)11:42:33","name":"Anonymous","com":"Lel<br><br>&#039;Teenage love&#039; and clubbing is fun for like a month, then it turns to shit pretty fast.<br><br>Make sure you land a high paying job, get a nice car and House, then find girl and make kids<br><br>You&#039;re 26, men kan make babies until 45 or some shit<br><br>Stop moaning like a bitch","time":1493653353,"resto":123632332,"id":"fWoSL\/4X","country":"DK","country_name":"Denmark"},{"no":123634520,"now":"05\/01\/17(Mon)11:43:45","name":"Anonymous","com":"just lift and bee yourself","time":1493653425,"resto":123632332,"id":"z1gLiWN5","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":123634642,"now":"05\/01\/17(Mon)11:44:53","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123632332\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123632332<\/a><br>Are you me?","time":1493653493,"resto":123632332,"id":"q4FbJPAY","country":"US","country_name":"United States"}]}

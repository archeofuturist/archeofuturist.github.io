Sure he has a pre-existing condition. He&#039;s overweight, is that his fault? No really, most cases of obesity stem from poor genetics. People have different metabolism. Plus boogie is probably a millionaire and makes a lot of money that he puts back into the economy in the form of purchasing goods and services. He makes millions of people happy and entertains them with his videos and game reviews.","filename":"Boogie","ext":".jpg","w":500,"h":446,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":223,"tim":1493946366255,"time":1493946366,"md5":"hVpRru8LD9Y2y92jpLKJPg==","fsize":44261,"resto":0,"id":"z5GK4JGP","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"wait-can-someone-explain-why-people-like","country_name":"United States","replies":13,"images":1,"unique_ips":14},{"no":124141996,"now":"05\/04\/17(Thu)21:09:33","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p124141553\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;124141553<\/a><br>https:\/\/youtu.be\/z5lH4l9Ii04<br><br>Here.","time":1493946573,"resto":124141553,"id":"6wAyYeNF","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":124142103,"now":"05\/04\/17(Thu)21:10:25","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p124141553\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;124141553<\/a><br>Fuck off.","time":1493946625,"resto":124141553,"id":"59Zrr87K","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":124142265,"now":"05\/04\/17(Thu)21:11:46","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p124141996\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;124141996<\/a><br>Francis and the range is all made up<br>https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=QGE<wbr>jtl3iYAQ","time":1493946706,"resto":124141553,"id":"jmGLwFEx","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":124142539,"now":"05\/04\/17(Thu)21:13:58","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p124141553\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;124141553<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;He&#039;s overweight, is that his fault?<\/span><br>Yes.","time":1493946838,"resto":124141553,"id":"JQvS8AQD","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":124142745,"now":"05\/04\/17(Thu)21:15:26","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p124141996\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;124141996<\/a><br><br><br>I couldn&#039;t hear anything other than double chins flabbing against each other","time":1493946926,"resto":124141553,"id":"HPQ640Az","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":124143131,"now":"05\/04\/17(Thu)21:18:19","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p124141553\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;124141553<\/a>","filename":"lqb","ext":".jpg","w":600,"h":600,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":125,"tim":1493947099253,"time":1493947099,"md5":"vE4jQELjCdc6agE6TibR0w==","fsize":16726,"resto":124141553,"id":"LN38lNwF","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":124143602,"now":"05\/04\/17(Thu)21:22:04","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p124141553\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;124141553<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;shouldn&#039;t deserve<\/span><br>That isn&#039;t how that works.

They construct cities, jobs, and factories, and civilize the people of Africa. We bomb the middle east, do regime changes, and destabilize the region. And we never learn from out mistakes either. <br><br>- The Chinese aren&#039;t afraid of working with Russia. They plan on releasing a gold backed currency with Russia to get away from the USD. Americans are so immature when it comes to Russia. <br><br>-The Chinese do have a growing film and animation industry. <br><br>-The Chinese middle class grows every day, while the American middle class shrinks every day. <br><br>-The Chinese still have industry. Its unfair to call Chinese products &quot;junk,&quot; they are OK, they get the job done.","filename":"China-Flag-4[1]","ext":".jpg","w":1200,"h":745,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":155,"tim":1491335462279,"time":1491335462,"md5":"aH+QXQ4Mkam2A06EINcomg==","fsize":42687,"resto":0,"id":"3Q22XU3k","country":"US","m_img":1,"bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"china-strong","country_name":"United States","replies":1,"images":0,"unique_ips":2},{"no":119507932,"now":"04\/04\/17(Tue)15:52:44","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119507748\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119507748<\/a><br>Yet you live in America. <br><br>Because China is shit and everyone knows it.","time":1491335564,"resto":119507748,"id":"j9\/qlRQt","country":"CA","country_name":"Canada"}]}

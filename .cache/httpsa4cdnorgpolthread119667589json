While in the meantime, the MSM is losing them. Their ratings are plummeting while YouTubers such as Molyneux, Paul Joseph Watson, DeFranco etc. are getting more and more subscribers every day. In other words, they&#039;re losig influence because the majority of their viewers are older people. Young people are watching independents more and more because they don&#039;t watch a lot of TV, compared to said older people. Keep that in mind.<br><br>If you haven&#039;t been living under a rock, in the past weeks a bunch of big advertisers pulled their ads from YouTube, as a boycot because their ads were being shown on &quot;controlversial videos&quot;. Those big companies that pulled their ads all -coincidentally- own liberal media outlets such as BBC, CNN, MSNBC, WB, .. whose, like I said, ratings are plummeting. Again, they&#039;re losing influence. In response, YouTube is looking at implementing AI that censors\/removes controversial content. An other tactic is demonitizing controversial videos.<br><br>Guess who is categorized under &quot;controversial videos&quot;? People like PJW, Molyneux, ChrisRayGun, A Black Guy, .. All rightwing\/contrarian\/conservative youtubers. Even people like PewDiePie and JonTron are getting targetted since -coincidentally- they expressed some controversial opinions. All of these people critisized the MSM and &quot;global narrative&quot; they&#039;re trying to push. With the exception of BIG YouTubers, if YouTubers get demonitized, they lose their income and potentially won&#039;t make any more videos, essentially being shut down.<br><br>So, tl;dr:<br>Liberal mega-companies who own liberal news outlets are &quot;blackmailing&quot; YouTube into censoring right-wing YouTubers in an attempt to regain control over the narrative younger people have.<br><br>What can we do about this?","filename":"1487229788925","ext":".jpg","w":500,"h":700,"tn_w":178,"tn_h":250,"tim":1491432055257,"time":1491432055,"md5":"sdicqX0c6oVdAHUtVp91XQ==","fsize":130481,"resto":0,"id":"Po8Miy0r","country":"BE","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"are-liberals-trying-to-regain-control-over-the","country_name":"Belgium","replies":3,"images":0,"unique_ips":2},{"no":119670280,"now":"04\/05\/17(Wed)19:04:43","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119667589\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119667589<\/a><br>bump","time":1491433483,"resto":119667589,"id":"Po8Miy0r","country":"BE","country_name":"Belgium"},{"no":119670575,"now":"04\/05\/17(Wed)19:07:28","name":"Anonymous","com":"It&#039;s fucking simple.

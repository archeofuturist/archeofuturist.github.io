Now here me out, okay? You guys all have your views, but we need to stick together until our true enemy is defeated- the red terror, the Antifa Menace... The Left! They&#039;ve managed to unite under the idea that they are all in it together, yet we&#039;re still stuck with each other. This isn&#039;t the Dark Ages, we need to ignore race and creed and sexuality at least for now until we can crush the left. Fascists! Fellow Monarchists! National Socialists! Hell, even Conservatives! All right wing ideologies! Heed my call! We must band together, work together, defeat the enemy! And I know there will be infiltrators of these communist organisations hating this thread, but the voice of free speech can never be defeated!","filename":"fascismmonarchy","ext":".png","w":1000,"h":800,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":200,"tim":1492633650292,"time":1492633650,"md5":"2rnpIESw03RT7UW3LxlEsA==","fsize":198464,"resto":0,"id":"SR4+JUC5","country":"GB","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"we-must-unify-against-the-true-enemy","country_name":"United Kingdom","replies":1,"images":0,"unique_ips":1},{"no":121891300,"now":"04\/19\/17(Wed)16:28:38","name":"Matt","com":"Okay I messed up a bit there, when I said &quot;We&#039;re still stuck with each other&quot; I meant to say &quot;We&#039;re still stuck hating each other&quot; rip","time":1492633718,"resto":121891146,"id":"SR4+JUC5","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"}]}

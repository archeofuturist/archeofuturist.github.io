Merely to provide a template whereby the battle occurs betwixt the super-human and the sub-human, per se, and it exists across or between individuals. My view is that immersion in dream-like or solipsistic material that has a different rhythm or vibration will turn Caucasian wimps into cultured neanderthals. For what is required is an attitude to life which goes forward towards the great noontide, open-armed, in the manner of the sun-worship at the end of Herman Hesse\u2019s The Glass Bead Game.<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;I am not preaching anti-intellectuality, but extolling the licentiousness and chthonian violence of re-integration. The affliction which Indo-Europeans suffer from is entirely mental and subjective; they are chronically afraid of their own shadow in Jungian terms. If the civilization which their ancestors created has any future at all then they must overcome their resistance to barbarism; they must o\u2019erleap it on the altar of high culture. They must dispel the cloud and lay out a future where Arthur Butz\u2019s credo doesn\u2019t have to be true (or not).<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Truthfully, in this age those with intellect have no courage and those with some modicum of physical courage have no intellect. If things are to alter during the next fifty years then we must re-embrace Byron\u2019s ideal: the cultured thug.<\/span>","filename":"Ideas_are_inborn","ext":".jpg","w":1519,"h":1293,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":212,"tim":1490261717315,"time":1490261717,"md5":"F1egV\/uq58Wy9BXLDb8c3A==","fsize":278040,"resto":0,"id":"zNVPMkI7","country":"AU","m_img":1,"bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"was-jonathan-bowden-right","country_name":"Australia","replies":0,"images":0,"unique_ips":1}]}

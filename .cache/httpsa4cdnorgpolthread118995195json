I have flat feet and didn&#039;t even know until meps, they didn&#039;t even make me waiver it (I had to get 6 other waivers for some arrests when I was a teenager) the doctor just marked it and informed me. Also know a lot of people with asthma, gang tattoos, hell when I was at meps they were doing everything they could to push this 300lb weak sack of 36 asvab scoring shit through since even if you can&#039;t pass the ift and body standards you can still due this retarded fat body thing where you do 2 pushups and stand up and down 5 times in like 3 minutes, of course the fat nigger still failed though lol. The real killer is color blindness since most people don&#039;t know they&#039;re color blind until at meps, seen a lot of fucked up open contracts from that shit.","time":1490925828,"resto":118995195,"id":"5Wc6iUsc","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":119004663,"now":"03\/30\/17(Thu)22:11:05","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119003810\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119003810<\/a><br>How the fuck can you not know you&#039;re color blind?","time":1490926265,"resto":118995195,"id":"oFpYtHrI","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":119005418,"now":"03\/30\/17(Thu)22:17:51","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119004663\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119004663<\/a><br>There&#039;s loads of types of color blindness that there&#039;s seriously almost no way you&#039;d notice without having someone point it out.

I&#039;m not even talking about a few people either, I&#039;d say 1 in every 10 dudes I was there with found out they were color blind.

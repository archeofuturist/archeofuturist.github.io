Patrol cars with an AR in them doesn&#039;t seem like an issue and it became standard after the North Hollywood Bank robbery because officers with handguns couldn&#039;t effectively handle the nature of the threat.

Several officers also appropriated AR-15 and other semi-automatic rifles from a nearby firearms dealer. The incident sparked debate on the need for patrol officers to upgrade their firepower in preparation for similar situations in the future.

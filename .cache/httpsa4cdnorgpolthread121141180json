It&#039;s mostly the niggers. Now look, these guys aren&#039;t the most polite, intellectually leaning, civilized, evolved, or nonviolent people you&#039;ll ever meet in your life. Actually, they might shoot you for looking at them wrong, being white, or trying to prevent them from engaging in their traditional cultural pastimes of thievery, rape, and armed robbery. The North American Pavement Ape here, on display at your local correctional facility, is a pretty big factor in this debate. Niggers make the militarization of the police force inevitable. Every time some spear chucker gets killed while robbing a liquor store or attacking a police officer and trying to get his gun in the ensuing scuffle, or every time one of them is arrested for the perfectly innocent victimless crime of raping an eighty five year old woman then beating her to death afterwards, or any other legal decision or election result that&#039;s unpopular with the Basketball American community, they go bananas (no pun intended) chimp the fuck out and burn down six to ten cities simultaneously. This clearly can&#039;t be dealt with by using Barney fucking Fife style tactics. The bottom line is this, niggers ruin everything, even America. If they weren&#039;t here, barring a few Mexicans here or there, we would have a violent crime rate comparable to any white western or eastern European nation. If we didn&#039;t have all of these violent, impulsive, low IQ parasites here sucking us dry by leeching off of our social programs, taking advantage of our suicidal pathological altruism, your local police force wouldn&#039;t need a fucking tank and fully automatic weapons and armored vehicles. It&#039;s a shame really because this isn&#039;t just affecting them. This isn&#039;t just a problem in their filthy, disease and drug infested, poverty stricken, dangerous, and smelly neighborhoods anymore. It&#039;s affecting actual human beings.","filename":"Screenshot_2017-03-25-02-10-15","ext":".jpg","w":642,"h":540,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":105,"tim":1492222777045,"time":1492222777,"md5":"qURx2YtYyWLDSV0qKd\/FFg==","fsize":73709,"resto":121141180,"id":"7Wrj0Wr3","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":121154227,"now":"04\/14\/17(Fri)22:22:44","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121141180\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121141180<\/a><br>There was a report and domestic violence and a gun in my old hometown and a swat twam with an armored car camped outside the house.

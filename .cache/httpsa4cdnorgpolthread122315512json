It is my life, my identity, and the source of my values. But for the life of me I cannot understand why there are so many conservatives that are just anti-science. It just doesnt make sense to me. Sure, you can have opinions, but science is literally nonpartisan. The results of science are not opinions, they are literally facts. You could, if you had enough money, go out and buy the instruments and test the things you doubt. Like, obviously the world is round. Obviously CO2 levels are rising. Obviously the glaciers are melting. Obviously GMO fruits are fine. Its not a jewish conspiracy, you can go out and research this stuff for yourself and come to the same conclusions.<br><br>I really just dont understand, unless our party has a tendency for willful ignorance.

Sure, you can have opinions, but science is literally nonpartisan. The results of science are not opinions, they are literally facts. You could, if you had enough money, go out and buy the instruments and test the things you doubt. Like, obviously the world is round. Obviously CO2 levels are rising. Obviously the glaciers are melting. Obviously GMO fruits are fine.

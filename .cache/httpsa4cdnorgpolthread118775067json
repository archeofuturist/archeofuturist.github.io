Only little kids and literally sub 80 IQ people just take it at face value, and they are the kind of people who defer to other people in their life for almost every other belief too.","time":1490788494,"resto":118775067,"id":"EsUemAS1","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":118777876,"now":"03\/29\/17(Wed)07:56:17","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118776641\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118776641<\/a><br>https:\/\/youtu.be\/NAh9oLs67Cw","time":1490788577,"resto":118775067,"id":"1bXn0YyC","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":118778128,"now":"03\/29\/17(Wed)07:59:14","name":"Anonymous","com":"Having the belief in god and losing it is better, because it gives a better slate to understand the true goings on of the universe.","filename":"Alan-Watts","ext":".jpg","w":2267,"h":1588,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":87,"tim":1490788754042,"time":1490788754,"md5":"9H9gqf1Z9bHlzQeeGCCaxg==","fsize":1056069,"resto":118775067,"id":"v5nN3vir","country":"AU","m_img":1,"country_name":"Australia"},{"no":118778428,"now":"03\/29\/17(Wed)08:01:19","name":"Anonymous","com":"Look, let&#039;s be real here.<br><br>There is no way in hell this world is created by a coincidence as most atheists say.<br><br>that&#039;s like saying a tornado flew over a bunch of metallic parts and randomly assembled them into a gun.","filename":"1490004271522","ext":".jpg","w":453,"h":439,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":121,"tim":1490788879686,"time":1490788879,"md5":"F+pY3cTPTH2FwBhzDcPGMQ==","fsize":86684,"resto":118775067,"id":"\/rXajXC9","country":"TN","country_name":"Tunisia"}]}

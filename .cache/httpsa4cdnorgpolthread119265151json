I remember doing my driving test for my license back when this happened and it was on the radio. Apparently there was some guy that was holding the doors closed on the outside of the building so that people couldn&#039;t get out. Later on they got that guy on the radio and he said that he did it because he thought the killer was trying to get out of the building. I think it&#039;s kinda bullshit, there was also some other sketchy people around but I don&#039;t remember much else.

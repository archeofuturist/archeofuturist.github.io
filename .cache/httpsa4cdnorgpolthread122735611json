Many people who come from poverty try and help you but a lot of other people literally treat me like a slave. It&#039;s like if you want to be filthy rich you have to be a slimy scumbag willing to con your own family and it trickles down, even people who aren&#039;t rich are becoming sub human apes who just grunt and scream when they want something, respect is decency is rolling in its grave and everyone is a faithless subhuman ape ruled by greed and void of all principles. <br><br>It&#039;s not even customers my age, people over 40 basically all but spit on me. I thank them while I sell them stuff with a smile.<br><br>Its not about rich or poor desu it&#039;s just about being decent to your fellow countryman regardless of his standing.","filename":"1488057107963","ext":".png","w":500,"h":421,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":105,"tim":1493132825452,"time":1493132825,"md5":"slCZUzqHTCFBQ5CEDmeaxA==","fsize":82104,"resto":122735611,"id":"2aDcL98g","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":122743014,"now":"04\/25\/17(Tue)11:07:05","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122739342\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122739342<\/a><br>I&#039;ve seem more specious holohoax rooms","time":1493132825,"resto":122735611,"id":"z1uOHE2f","country":"CY","country_name":"Cyprus"},{"no":122743099,"now":"04\/25\/17(Tue)11:07:55","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122740038\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122740038<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;I had to launder that money through gambling so I could secure loans to start buying property and start my business.<\/span><br>Do you mind explaining this in more detail to an economically illiterate guy like me?","time":1493132875,"resto":122735611,"id":"NkcjcnOC","country":"SE","country_name":"Sweden"},{"no":122743110,"now":"04\/25\/17(Tue)11:08:02","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122743014\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122743014<\/a><br>* spacious","time":1493132882,"resto":122735611,"id":"z1uOHE2f","country":"CY","country_name":"Cyprus"},{"no":122743113,"now":"04\/25\/17(Tue)11:08:02","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122736432\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122736432<\/a><br>this. richfags should be ashamed.","time":1493132882,"resto":122735611,"id":"8vjELA\/7","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":122743115,"now":"04\/25\/17(Tue)11:08:02","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122742653\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122742653<\/a><br>Yeah, for a long time kings in Europe were just the nobles&#039; bitches.","time":1493132882,"resto":122735611,"id":"FyyyrfRK","country":"LT","country_name":"Lithuania"},{"no":122743169,"now":"04\/25\/17(Tue)11:08:34","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122741932\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122741932<\/a><br>Couldn&#039;t you rent the place out?","time":1493132914,"resto":122735611,"id":"xVx0duEP","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":122743184,"now":"04\/25\/17(Tue)11:08:45","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122741787\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122741787<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Feeling a sense of superiority because of monetary wealth and materialism&#039;s wont give you much success with women. <\/span><br>looks matter more but money still helps not that that was the point of the thread<br>https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=EFn<wbr>JMPQow7A","filename":"02aba3a4a4114be9b7bcc0754e6d5e3b","ext":".jpg","w":640,"h":635,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":124,"tim":1493132925366,"time":1493132925,"md5":"6afDRnIL2IEj+ODeH5eYyQ==","fsize":120597,"resto":122735611,"id":"V2WXPbES","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":122743212,"now":"04\/25\/17(Tue)11:09:05","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122743013\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122743013<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;but why do some people have to be so shitty about it<\/span><br>Because in a Libertarian and free society, no one else gives a fuck about your feelings.<br><br>Grow the fuck up you gommie cuck.","time":1493132945,"resto":122735611,"id":"6AM6I4Y4","country":"AU","country_name":"Australia"},{"no":122743221,"now":"04\/25\/17(Tue)11:09:08","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122742841\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122742841<\/a><br>I don&#039;t care.

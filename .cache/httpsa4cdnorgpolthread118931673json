Part of the reason why the early immigrants could assimilate is because they were a vast minority, and so could blend in with the crowd so to speak.

British culture, French culture, and Japanese culture are each the products of the respective native peoples.<br><br>Civic nationalism will always lead to the same thing- a dumbed down populace with no sense of real identity besides consumerism, which can be easily exploited and manipulated, as well as controlled.

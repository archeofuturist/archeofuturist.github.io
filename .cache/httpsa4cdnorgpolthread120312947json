So, too, has the very illogic of the premise being put forward to answer the question of why President Assad would risk everything by using chemical weapons against a target of zero military value, at a time when the strategic balance of power had shifted strongly in his favor. Likewise, why would Russia, which had invested considerable political capital in the disarmament of Syria\u2019s chemical weapons capability after 2013, stand by idly while the Syrian air force carried out such an attack, especially when their was such a heavy Russian military presence at the base in question at the time of the attack?<\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Such analysis seems beyond the scope and comprehension of the American fourth estate. Instead, media outlets like CNN embrace at face value anything they are told by official American sources, including a particularly preposterous insinuation that Russia actually colluded in the chemical weapons attack; the aforementioned presence of Russian officers at Al Shayrat air base has been cited as evidence that Russia had to have known about Syria\u2019s chemical warfare capability, and yet did nothing to prevent the attack.<\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;To sustain this illogic, the American public and decision-makers make use of a sophisticated propaganda campaign involving video images and narratives provided by forces opposed to the regime of Bashar al-Assad, including organizations like the \u201cWhite Helmets,\u201d the Syrian-American Medical Society, the Aleppo Media Center, which have a history of providing slanted information designed to promote an anti-Assad message (Donald Trump has all but acknowledged that these images played a major role in his decision to reevaluate his opinion of Bashar al-Assad and order the cruise missile attack on Al Shayrat airbase.)<\/span><br><br>Huffpo is dropping redpills today.","filename":"rocky3_original","ext":".jpg","w":456,"h":352,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":96,"tim":1491761577080,"time":1491761577,"md5":"bgY+TCaIIQ68OGYqvrArjw==","fsize":37951,"resto":120312947,"id":"tVfHga\/V","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":120313220,"now":"04\/09\/17(Sun)14:13:02","name":"Anonymous","com":"BLOWOUT CALENDAR<br><br>WEEK 11 OF TRUMP&#039;S REIGN<br><br>GET ME PAST THE THUMBNAIL<br><br>Blowout always, \/fellow\/ \/pol\/ack!<br><br>===========================<br><br>MONDAY APRIL 3RD<br>#1.

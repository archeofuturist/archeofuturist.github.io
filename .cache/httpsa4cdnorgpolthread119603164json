Im not sure I understand your question.<br><br>Let me see if I can help, consider this:<br><br>Governments are just long pauses between human stampedes. Humanity itself is a concept invented by primates, you must not forget that. Its a common daydream that we apes wake up to and play out everyday.<br><br>Often, we forget, and when we do, its obvious. It happens everyday and the ape is exposed (among some more than others, because some are better at daydreaming under more circumstances. Some barely daydream at all).<br><br>Take &#039;global terrorism&#039; for example. Its not about religion. It was a technological inevitability that the majority of humanity was going to fall behind others and then once they had access to technology, they would use it to aggres upon those who have, just like it is inevitable that those who have would have to simultaneously defend while advancing themselves.<br><br>Perhaps you are confusing the narratives with reality. Hope this was at all helpful. Do what you like and feel is natural and you will be fine. Just try to save a few moments a day for the daydream of humanity, it will help you relate to those who honestly cant tell the difference, and its probably better they dont anyways.","filename":"Heavy T ","ext":".jpg","w":900,"h":900,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":125,"tim":1491399618432,"time":1491399618,"md5":"dhhhEJV1YQkxuEauLqyzRg==","fsize":750127,"resto":119603164,"id":"Fi8Vi4XO","country":"US","country_name":"United States"}]}

Remember when he picked Pence? We were all upset but then we realized it was just another 5D chess move. I think, in time, we&#039;ll realize that this move was exactly the same.<br><br>Remember Trump&#039;s goals<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;destroy ISIS<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;build safe zones in Syria to end the refugee crisis<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;rebuild relations with Russia<\/span><br><br>now that Trump has taken the lead on dealing with Assad, he can plan a military intervention where we destroy ISIS and set up safe zones. However, Russia is aligned with Assad, and won&#039;t let us just walk all over him. This gives a golden opportunity for Trump to meet with Assad and Putin, and work out a plan to destroy ISIS and set up safe zones.<br><br>This accomplishes two things. First, it will show that the refugee crisis in Europe is actually just Africans going to wealthy countries for free money and women. Once they have a place to return to, and still refuse, it will be come apparent to everyone.<br><br>Secondly, it shows that Russia and America can, in fact, find common interest and work together. This will make it easier in the future to ease sanctions and allow for trade\/diplomacy to return to pre-USSR levels<br><br>Thirdly, it gives us another opportunity to utterly destroy Iran by surprise, and ensure that Israel will continue to grow and continue to be based. We love our based Israelis, don&#039;t we folks?<br><br>Anyways, like I was saying... this is 5D chess and we&#039;ve got to trust in le god emperor.

Why is not govt doing anything about crisis that plages US and has for years. My wife and I go to a funeral a year for last 12 years. Nothing changes. I will change this. Heroin is not grown in U.S. It is imported by illegal immigrants. I am not a weak man. I may cry tomorrow but I will rage. I may kill. I will have my revenge. I have lost too many family and friends because our government can&#039;t control the cartels and stop the degenerate liberals from brain washing our youth.","filename":"IMG_0966","ext":".jpg","w":1220,"h":2578,"tn_w":118,"tn_h":250,"tim":1492394290228,"time":1492394290,"md5":"s2fVDUhRPgW8H2MGWWjnmA==","fsize":199712,"resto":0,"id":"Vszdt1W9","country":"US","m_img":1,"bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"going-to-my-wifes-brothers-funeral-this-week-drug","country_name":"United States","replies":0,"images":0,"unique_ips":1}]}

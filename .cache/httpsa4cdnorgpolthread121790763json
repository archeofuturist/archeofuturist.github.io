Neither can liberalism can be approached -- as some people do -- as a conversation conducted among philosophers over the centuries. Instead, liberalism must be understood, I think, as a political and social doctrine and a movement grounded in the distinctive culture and traceable to specific historical condition. That culture is the west. A Europe that rose in communion with the bishop of Rome. The historical conditions were those of the middle ages. The history of liberalism is rooted in what economic historians call the European miracle.<\/span><br><br>Historicist libertarians master race.","filename":"Ralph Raico 2005","ext":".jpg","w":240,"h":299,"tn_w":100,"tn_h":125,"tim":1492577538341,"time":1492577538,"md5":"0RLqG1mObGyzQkQQBJAUlg==","fsize":9952,"resto":121790763,"id":"8TtZrO8C","country":"CA","country_name":"Canada"},{"no":121804404,"now":"04\/19\/17(Wed)00:55:20","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121790763\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121790763<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;libertarian right<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;not anarchists<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;not austrian economics<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;not retards<\/span><br><br>you are not a libertarian<br><br>real libertarians call themselves liberals","time":1492577720,"resto":121790763,"id":"RGe2xDZK","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":121804457,"now":"04\/19\/17(Wed)00:55:49","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121802919\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121802919<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;he doesn&#039;t know about the European liberal tradition<\/span><br><br>&quot;Le journal des \u00e9conomistes&quot; was just all bullshit and Herbert Spencer, John Stuart Mills and Lord Acton were just didn&#039;t exist.","time":1492577749,"resto":121790763,"id":"8TtZrO8C","country":"CA","country_name":"Canada"},{"no":121804641,"now":"04\/19\/17(Wed)00:57:34","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121803410\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121803410<\/a><br>This bitch probably doesn&#039;t understand that libertarian do not draw a necessary connection between democracy and freedom rooted in respect for property right.<br><br>Hong Kong didn&#039;t have democracy but was free from the point of view of property rights.","time":1492577854,"resto":121790763,"id":"8TtZrO8C","country":"CA","country_name":"Canada"},{"no":121804709,"now":"04\/19\/17(Wed)00:58:07","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121804058\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121804058<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;all my stuff comes from a economically illiterate think tank funded by wall st<\/span>","time":1492577887,"resto":121790763,"id":"RGe2xDZK","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":121804924,"now":"04\/19\/17(Wed)01:00:15","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121804404\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121804404<\/a><br>Liberals focus intensely on equality, but equality cannot be guaranteed without rigorous intervention on the part of the state.

Otherwise tradesmen, farmers, and the rest were more or less left to their own devices, minor crimes and governing were left to local authorities or village leaders, and most people had an astounding amount of free time, especially during the winter season.

The root comes from the Greek aristos - meaning best. In the quadripartite caste system of ancient Aryan civilizations they were the warrior caste, the best physically, the best morally, etc. Above them were only the priestly caste and sometimes a king, in whom the functions of the warrior and priestly caste were united (hence purple is the royal color - a sort of blend of red for the virile warrior caste, and white from the priestly caste). <br><br>But things have reached such a point today that there are no caste systems anywhere, no hierarchy.

Meaning most of the jap population would&#039;ve died in a firestorm of air raids and a nation wide Stalingrad like battle. Those who survive would then be treated to the rape fest the Russian soldiers are known to throw. Then after all that finally there would be a north and south Japan with the soviets controlling the north and allies in the south, just like Korea, and that worked out great for them didn&#039;t it. So looks like nuking a bunch of civilians was the kindest thing the US has done for anyone.","time":1491419703,"resto":119637921,"id":"X+12RAb8","country":"US","country_name":"United States"}]}

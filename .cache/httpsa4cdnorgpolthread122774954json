Unless you&#039;re one of the parasites, the system is designed such that all surplus value from your work is siphoned off to feed the parasites and the war machine. People who actually read fucking and know history understand that America has been mixed-commie on the way to full-commie ever since Marx was writing love letters to Abraham Lincoln. The right in this country only exists because the American commies are too weak to purge them outright and need the incremental conversion while controlling the opposition.<br><br>If you work and aren&#039;t a millionaire than you don&#039;t get much more for your effort than you would from welfare. Only thing you lose is some freedom of choice of where to stay. And decent things you can find used if you save up some money collecting cans or whatever. Other things you just find someone dumb enough to give you a credit card and max it out and default on it. You&#039;re on welfare for life so your credit score doesn&#039;t matter obviously.<br><br>Really we just have to look at the facts logically. We&#039;ve got 100 million people in America not doing shit but living comfortably enough that they aren&#039;t rioting or eating each other. And another 100 million jobs easy must be total bullshit busywork not needed for anyone to survive. So the reality is that we&#039;ve been in the Communist dream of the hyper surplus for quite some time now, productivity and tech has advanced to the point where we can supply everyone&#039;s needs, or else we couldn&#039;t get by with so many not working or doing bullshit work.<br><br>So we can see that 80% of the job economy is just unnecessary for anyone&#039;s needs, and the rest of it just contributes to degeneracy and the war machine. And if you want to live a right life and livelihood, then you&#039;ll avoid any contribution direct or indirect to this evil economy. Welfare, millionaire, or priest are really the only moral options.","time":1493151280,"resto":122774954,"id":"ODD9YzBY","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":122780223,"now":"04\/25\/17(Tue)16:14:48","name":"Anonymous","com":"<span class=\"quote\">&gt;democrats threaten a government shutdown if wall funding is put in the spending bill<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Trump gets blamed anyways<\/span><br>Every fucking time","filename":"1439139540698","ext":".png","w":800,"h":451,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":70,"tim":1493151288526,"time":1493151288,"md5":"3ryv9oGydWwHmjpPCXf9kg==","fsize":768410,"resto":122774954,"id":"QkaDNurM","country":"US","country_name":"United States"}]}

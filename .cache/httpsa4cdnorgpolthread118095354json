Did I ever tell you I fought his dad? He was hired to assassinate a senator me and your father were guarding. We kept bringing her around open windows and public areas in order to draw the would-be assassin out because we knew he had too much pride to just shoot her from long range. He had used his payment to hire another bounty hunter to kill the senator for him while he sent us on a wild bantha chase. Also the 2nd assassin used her payment to buy a robot to assassinate the senator for her. Did I mention the 2nd assassin was a shapeshifter? She could have been a good friend in disguise and just shot the senator for all we knew! Then the robot used its payment to buy poisonous bugs to release into the senator&#039;s room while she slept after lasering a hole through the window. It could have just lasered her too after that because we weren&#039;t watching her at all, but it already bought the bugs. So we sense the hostile life forms (not the robot) in the room and rush in and save the senator in the nick of time! Then I jumped out the window to chase the robot back to its owner! Luckily it didn&#039;t have a self-destruct function. Then we found the 2nd assassin and chased her across the planet, and caught her when she tried to kill us instead of shapeshifting and escaping. But to our surprise, Jango Fett was watching the whole thing instead of going to kill the senator while we were away chasing the bugs chasing the robot chasing the shapeshifter. He shot her with a poisonous dart instead of sniper blaster, and only her instead of shooting all of us or blowing all of us with a rocket or something, then he escaped with his tiny jetpack. Luckily for the senator, my good friend Dexterr Jettster owned a 50s dinner on Courscant that had Republic secrets on the menu along with cheeseburgers and malt shakes. We found the assassin and Mace killed him later, right in front of Boba.&quot;","filename":"Quot+watch+out+for+that+vicious+bounty+hunter+boba+fett+luke+_352311bea4ac7407bc1f061a37c0ed68","ext":".jpg","w":400,"h":534,"tn_w":93,"tn_h":125,"tim":1490373527287,"time":1490373527,"md5":"vfPHFgTUK\/ATE\/JX2fx46w==","fsize":56965,"resto":118095354,"id":"QTlQZCQU","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":118098807,"now":"03\/24\/17(Fri)12:38:59","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118098184\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118098184<\/a><br>Underrated","time":1490373539,"resto":118095354,"id":"jyGFiQZS","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":118098820,"now":"03\/24\/17(Fri)12:39:05","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118098399\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118098399<\/a><br>I cant wait until you get suicide bombed by some A-rab(as the uneducated in my state say it)","time":1490373545,"resto":118095354,"id":"atEmvj01","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":118098866,"now":"03\/24\/17(Fri)12:39:26","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118097930\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118097930<\/a><br>Geogre Lucas was based","time":1490373566,"resto":118095354,"id":"GHRqT6+4","country":"FI","country_name":"Finland"},{"no":118098891,"now":"03\/24\/17(Fri)12:39:39","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118095354\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118095354<\/a><br><br>What&#039;s the percentage of people who have finally admitted that Force Awakens was worse than the Prequels?<br><br>I know some people are ready to admit that, but is it a majority yet?<br><br>I mean FA was fun to watch but had no originality or depth whatsoever.

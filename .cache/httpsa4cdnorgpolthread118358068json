In news articles, mostly all that&#039;s discussed are individual issue positions, and never the philosophy behind them, which I think is the most attractive part of the alt-right. <br><br>One axiom I&#039;ve thought of is &quot;You don&#039;t have the right to be weak.&quot;. In my mind this perfectly encapsulates what the left is doing wrong. They are fighting for the right to be weak. It also works in multiple contexts. Self-control, personal responsibility, freedom of speech (anti-safe spaces), etc. <br><br>What else should we be pushing more as our philosophical roots? What are your axioms of belief? Remember, if its just something like &quot;fuck Jews&quot; it&#039;ll immediately get lambasted. We&#039;re looking for things that hold up to intense scrutiny and cut through the bullshit noise and grab the attention of the common man as undeniable truths.","filename":"1487887560370","ext":".jpg","w":539,"h":521,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":241,"tim":1490532330231,"time":1490532330,"md5":"fcvWXjVqsSKFn2WtwgLN4Q==","fsize":73340,"resto":0,"id":"qlaxud1P","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"pol-philosophy","country_name":"United States","replies":18,"images":3,"unique_ips":11},{"no":118358559,"now":"03\/26\/17(Sun)08:52:44","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118358068\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118358068<\/a><br><br>But that&#039;s wrong. They have a right to be weak. They don&#039;t have a right to leech of the strong. Everyone gets to make their own choices, but you don&#039;t get to push off the consequences on others and call yourself moral.<br><br>The ultimate axiom is personal property. You own your body. You own your decisions. You own the consequences of your decisions. That is the only way civilizations survive, because when people get to make bad choices without bad consequences, why would they stop making bad choices? This is why socialism can never work. It&#039;s stealing other people&#039;s money for the needs of the unproductive. You don&#039;t own other people&#039;s productivity. Productivity creates value, often expressed in money. Productivity takes time. Thus productive time equals money. You don&#039;t get to force other people to work for free because you don&#039;t own other people. That&#039;s slavery.<br><br>This is why nobody likes Leftists, they don&#039;t understand personal property.

A right is a concept of ownership of something that you cannot be denied under law, not under nature. You have a right to free speech, but in reality communist governments like Obama&#039;s USA or Erdogan in Turkey do not honor those rights and throw journalists in jail. A right from nature is the ownership of your body. Other people stealing your organs is wrong on a level anyone agrees on, except of course organ thieves.<br><br>Usually when I debate leftists, I ask simple questions like &quot;Do you believe in personal property&quot; and &quot;Is stealing morally wrong&quot;, followed by &quot;If you have a need, do you get to steal&quot; which then of course leads to criminal tax systems which rob people through the power of the government.<br><br>While I agree with the sentiment of what you&#039;re saying, it needlessly obfuscates the moral questions you&#039;re posing. Most leftists are not very intelligent. It is better to have them paint themselves into a corner by showing them that their own beliefs are contradictory.

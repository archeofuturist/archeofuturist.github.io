They don&#039;t really care about or believe any of the crap they&#039;re doing. <br><br>They&#039;re just angry little violent people with personal issues like this dipshit professor and they have an opportunity and an outlet now to act like fools.<br><br>The problem is that there are no consequences for their actions. They know that. There are plenty of people who would like to act like that but they won&#039;t because there are consequences. But in Berkeley California, the fucking mayor and the police and the school and all these people are corrupt to the point where no nobody&#039;s going to do anything about this. <br><br>There are thousands and thousands of people even in civilized societies that would love to go fight and beat people over the head with Ulocks but they can&#039;t because they&#039;re not dindus living in the ghetto and they&#039;re generally in places where their afraid to because there are consequences. <br><br>Take away the people who don&#039;t provide consequences and you will solve the problem. Antifa is not the problem. The corrupt mayor government\/school\/police of Berkeley and California are the problem.","filename":"bane","ext":".jpg","w":625,"h":415,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":166,"tim":1492917137520,"time":1492917137,"md5":"hqhcf+tr0oqQ8pD7IFedaA==","fsize":23296,"resto":0,"id":"Hd1hKeNy","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"ok-ive-seen-and-heard-enough","country_name":"United States","replies":0,"images":0,"unique_ips":1}]}

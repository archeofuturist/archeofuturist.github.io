There are lots of OK quality drugs made in Russia, that are dirt cheap. And there are still drugs that are imported from EU, that are of a fine quality and still not that expensive. However, my fellow dirty slav forgets, that there are stuff that you can get only in hospital. Still, while the free medical service are crap, private hospitals offer quality service for a very modest prices. With that sad, you must keep in mind that your average citizen in Russia still can&#039;t afford even the relatevly cheap private medecine.

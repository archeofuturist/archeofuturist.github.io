Take them for what you will.<br><br>From what I know, we all want the &quot;good life&quot;, but what is that? Some people go in pursue of pleasure, attempting to gain as much pleasure as possible. But if you are objectively observing, you will find that pleasure is a double-sided sword, where it will drain and eat at you, though it feels &quot;good&quot;. What does this mean, if we can clearly see it happening? Maybe we cannot know a direct answer, but we can agree that not all pleasures are good for us and to live in a constant state of pleasure is not realistic or healthy.<br><br>Then what are we to do? Perhaps a balance of hard work and pleasure will create the ultimate satisfaction. Yet we can find that if our work serves no purpose, we are not satisfied still internally. To discover that purpose, we must look deep inside AND outside of ourselves. If you only look internally, your perception will corrupt and you will most likely look for a purpose that somehow aligns with power, which is a deception and reaction to deep-seated insecurities.<br><br>To find a sense of peace in this restless world, for myself step 1 was realizing the system we have in place will not give it to you. Step 2 is realizing we can never find eternal peace in human relationships, though they are important, they will never satisfy our longing.<br><br>We must find a way to interact with the divine, with God. From there, we can begin to understand a purpose that transcends outside of ourselves and this world. You will find peace and harmony through this, but you must first develop this sense and relationship before you can understand what His plan for your life is.","filename":"bruegel3","ext":".jpg","w":1083,"h":784,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":90,"tim":1491746804746,"time":1491746804,"md5":"OGr2MEaAptmnjJBb2PXzlw==","fsize":205072,"resto":120270601,"id":"0QP9v3J+","country":"US","m_img":1,"country_name":"United States"},{"no":120285571,"now":"04\/09\/17(Sun)10:06:46","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120270601\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120270601<\/a><br>Well first of all, you gotta eat big to get big. <br>Myself, I can eat 14 times a day.","filename":"Disappointed_piana","ext":".jpg","w":900,"h":900,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":125,"tim":1491746806828,"time":1491746806,"md5":"GTGKx6\/WS60k\/aU+ouaZfA==","fsize":81020,"resto":120270601,"id":"ECINz1uq","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":120285620,"now":"04\/09\/17(Sun)10:07:15","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120274190\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120274190<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;It didn&#039;t help understanding climate change either.

It is within our nature to Sin, so we will continue to develop negative Karma naturally and then constantly need to purify it, however this is not an endless cycle.<br><br>From practice and habit, you can learn to stop sinfu habits and thus lower your negative karma by a ton, making you more pure.

Pay no heed to them, for often times forces that exist beyond us are influencing them out of hatred for God and seeing someone escaping the system of oppression. <br><br>Ultimately, we all have unique destinies. Not everyone follows their destiny though, we have free will. God does actually have plans for all of us, but he let us choose, and the only way we can know God&#039;s plan is to follow the light we see deep down, the light that at times everything else is screaming for us to avoid or laughing at us for pursuing. This light is what will guide you out of the land of oppression and into love. It is personal and belongs to you. Once you know it and are able to savor true peace, protect it and continue to follow it. God is the only one who will never betray you in this world.

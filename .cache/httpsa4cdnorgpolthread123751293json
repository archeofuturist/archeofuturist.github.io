As if they are pupils in the first grade. For most part it&#039;s limited to SEAORG shitbags other branches of the military probably have some other secret gestures. What does &quot;rear&quot; mean anyways - is it about them being backwards or is it a hint about them using their &quot;rear&quot; to get to the star studded position. Don&#039;t make mistake about schlomo - he is not a symbol that represents jews or judaism. I&#039;m using it as symbol to represent borats. <br><br>https:\/\/www.google.com\/search?q=rea<wbr>r+admiral&amp;tbm=isch","filename":"admirals","ext":".jpg","w":2000,"h":1842,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":230,"tim":1493718751688,"time":1493718751,"md5":"zxcjT0m\/3i5c9yq0VrbxkQ==","fsize":711236,"resto":0,"id":"i2iOz2xL","country":"LT","m_img":1,"bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"hands-of-seaorg","country_name":"Lithuania","replies":5,"images":0,"unique_ips":3},{"no":123754310,"now":"05\/02\/17(Tue)06:37:06","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123751293\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123751293<\/a><br>these SEAORG shitbags should be held responsible for shuffling all those trojan horses into EU.

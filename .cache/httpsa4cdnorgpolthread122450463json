I feel more creative when I stop repressing the drive to do degenerate things. The notion that cultural relativism and aesthetic relativism are one and the same entering my consciousness really stifles the part of the creation process that isn&#039;t conscious. Is this why right wingers are generally not artistically pioneering? I don&#039;t think people like Lewis and Clark and Columbus were lefties, but it seems like lefties are (or at least non-righties) the best explorers of the metaphysical.","filename":"tumblr_n7afl8eksF1tec7r3o2_540","ext":".png","w":540,"h":621,"tn_w":217,"tn_h":250,"tim":1492967947833,"time":1492967947,"md5":"5pk504A2R0pF5cd2vJPdhg==","fsize":142867,"resto":0,"id":"soFLDKrC","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"is-creativity-degenerate","country_name":"United States","replies":6,"images":1,"unique_ips":4},{"no":122451594,"now":"04\/23\/17(Sun)13:26:29","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122450463\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122450463<\/a><br>Find god.

They&#039;re both creative but in different fields. The right will be creative through engineering while the left will be creative in arts. Pushed to the extreme the left will be creative in ultra degenerate ways because of their emotional nature. This is why you have pornstars and cuckolds with a shit fetish coming from the left. This is not to say that the right doesn&#039;t have these but it&#039;s a lot lower.<br><a href=\"#p122451594\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122451594<\/a><br>Retard.","time":1492968587,"resto":122450463,"id":"MwDxRavG","country":"US","country_name":"United States"}]}

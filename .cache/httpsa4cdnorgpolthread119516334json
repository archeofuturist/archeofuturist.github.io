Such site visits have been conducted by officers of the USCIS Office of Fraud Detection and National Security since 2009. Under the new initiative, H-1B site visits will focus on three categories of employers:<br><br> H-1B dependent employers (generally, employers with 51 or more employees with at least 15% of their workforce composed of H-1B beneficiaries)<br><br> Employers filing petitions for employees who will be assigned to work at the worksites of different companies <br><br> Employers whose business information cannot be verified through commercially available data (including, primarily, the Validation Instrument for Business Enterprises (VIBE) tool, which is based on a Dun &amp; Bradstreet database<br><br>In addition, the announcement notes that \u201crandom\u201d site visits will continue to occur.<br><br>The practical effect of this announcement may be that site visits to the workplaces of employers that do not fall into one of these categories will diminish, while site visits to employers that do fall into one of these categories will spike sharply and possibly be all but certain. All employers of H-1B beneficiaries are encouraged to adequately prepare for such site visits by ensuring that<br><br> information contained in H-1B petitions is at all times accurate and up to date, and<br><br> thorough site visit protocols that govern in detail how such visits will be handled are in

We verify H-1B workers\u2019 wages, job duties, and work locations during site visits. This action is not meant to target nonimmigrant employees for any kind of criminal or administrative action but rather to identify employers who are abusing the system. <br><br>We seek to determine if workers are not being paid while in the United States as they wait for projects or work, a practice known as \u201cbenching\u201d which violates U.S. immigration laws. We also conduct site visits in cases where there are suspicions of fraud or abuse and refer many of the cases to our counterparts at U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) for further investigation. <br><br>Starting this month, we will take a more targeted approach focusing on:<br><br> H-1B-dependent employers (those who have a high ratio of H-1B workers as compared to U.S. workers, as defined by statute);<br> Cases where we cannot validate the employer\u2019s basic business information through commercially available data; and<br> Employers petitioning for H-1B workers who work off-site at another company or organization\u2019s location.<br><br>https:\/\/www.uscis.gov\/working-unite<wbr>d-states\/temporary-workers\/h-1b-spe<wbr>cialty-occupations-and-fashion-mode<wbr>ls\/combating-fraud-and-abuse-h-1b-v<wbr>isa-program","time":1491342990,"resto":119516334,"id":"Op\/XkHLC","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":119522538,"now":"04\/04\/17(Tue)17:56:34","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119522009\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119522009<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Its practical effect is that companies in the IT industry seeking H-1B status for their employees will likely have to prove that the positions at issue are not entry-level computer programming positions and that the employees\u2019 degrees and education are specifically related to such positions<\/span><br><br>fuck<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Alphabet Inc Class A<\/span><br>NASDAQ: GOOGL - Apr 4, 5:48 PM EDT<br>852.57USDPrice decrease4.18 (0.49%)","time":1491342994,"resto":119516334,"id":"oxwAEmkB","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":119522566,"now":"04\/04\/17(Tue)17:56:48","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119516334\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119516334<\/a><br>yyyeeesssss<br><br>Americans will fill those positions.","time":1491343008,"resto":119516334,"id":"\/Grwzffv","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":119522580,"now":"04\/04\/17(Tue)17:56:54","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119522529\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119522529<\/a><br><br>Targeted site visits will also help us determine whether H-1B-dependent employers who normally must meet H-1B recruitment attestation requirements are actually paying their workers the statutorily required salary to qualify for an exemption from these requirements.

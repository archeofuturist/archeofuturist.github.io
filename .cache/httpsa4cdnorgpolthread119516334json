Such site visits have been conducted by officers of the USCIS Office of Fraud Detection and National Security since 2009. Under the new initiative, H-1B site visits will focus on three categories of employers:<br><br> H-1B dependent employers (generally, employers with 51 or more employees with at least 15% of their workforce composed of H-1B beneficiaries)<br><br> Employers filing petitions for employees who will be assigned to work at the worksites of different companies <br><br> Employers whose business information cannot be verified through commercially available data (including, primarily, the Validation Instrument for Business Enterprises (VIBE) tool, which is based on a Dun &amp; Bradstreet database<br><br>In addition, the announcement notes that \u201crandom\u201d site visits will continue to occur.<br><br>The practical effect of this announcement may be that site visits to the workplaces of employers that do not fall into one of these categories will diminish, while site visits to employers that do fall into one of these categories will spike sharply and possibly be all but certain. All employers of H-1B beneficiaries are encouraged to adequately prepare for such site visits by ensuring that<br><br> information contained in H-1B petitions is at all times accurate and up to date, and<br><br> thorough site visit protocols that govern in detail how such visits will be handled are in

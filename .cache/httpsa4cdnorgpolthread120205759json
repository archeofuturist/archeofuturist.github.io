SHADILY!&quot;, it broke our fucking heart to see him turn into a neocon. In fact, every single person I know who supported Trump in June of 2015 (including myself) hates him as of 48 hours ago. <br><br>Basically, if someone still supports Trump, they never unironically supported him in the first place.<br><br>It makes me laugh that &quot;our colony&quot; on Reddit, turned into a cult who now has such strong ironic support for Trump that they can&#039;t stop defending their meme chaos president. Not to mention, he&#039;s not even politically incorrect anymore. Look at his tweets from the first six months of his campaign, and look at him now. Even if you are supporting him for epic meme\/troll reason, he&#039;s stopped being a Twitter troll a long time ago. You are worshiping the husk of the man that old \/pol\/ genuinely supported.","filename":"Mami-mami-tomoe-34623997-480-660","ext":".jpg","w":480,"h":660,"tn_w":90,"tn_h":125,"tim":1491698434624,"time":1491698434,"md5":"4G2SKYjEqk2P+V13GlF1gw==","fsize":324585,"resto":120205759,"id":"ZIUBDjIX","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":120209749,"now":"04\/08\/17(Sat)20:41:27","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120205759\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120205759<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;war with Assad<\/span><br>no, fuck that, leave Assad alone. let the kikes do their dirty work.<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;glassing kim<\/span><br>strangely, this is the one exception where I wouldn&#039;t care.

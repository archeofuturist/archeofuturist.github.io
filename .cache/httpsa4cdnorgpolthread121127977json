We had this exact same rigmarole back in 2013. Everyone on \/pol\/ was hyped up even when it was obvious it would all blow over.<br><br>I can promise all of you, with absolute 100% certainty, that nothing will come from this. I am as certain of the fact that nothing will happen as I am that the sky is blue and that 2+2=4. Every fucking spring North Korea will sabre rattle so they can extort more foreign aid out of the US. They do it because they know it works and that it would be far too risky for the US to do anything else.<br><br>The US government does not want a war against North Korea that it would gain nothing out of. Seoul would be flattened by artillery. Tokyo might be at risk too. The US, nor any other major world power, will go to war just to liberate the people of NK because the world doesn&#039;t operate on happy fun time logic. The US went to war against Iraq and Afghanistan because it had strong incentives to do so. The US would gain little from a war with NK and could lose a shit ton, so they won&#039;t. Even if they test a nuclear weapon tomorrow I can absolutely guarantee that within a few weeks everyone will have forgotten about all this and everything will be back to normal. Until we have the same stupid shit next spring. Seriously \/pol\/, WISE THE FUCK UP.","filename":"1492197103123","ext":".png","w":641,"h":470,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":183,"tim":1492210596382,"time":1492210596,"md5":"+0W78SG17vwrhRB4rZ2YGA==","fsize":540352,"resto":0,"id":"7eQPixgZ","country":"GB","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"nothing-is-going-to-happen-in-north-korea-you","country_name":"United Kingdom","replies":3,"images":0,"unique_ips":3},{"no":121128647,"now":"04\/14\/17(Fri)19:01:46","name":"Anonymous","com":"bump","time":1492210906,"resto":121127977,"id":"7eQPixgZ","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":121129957,"now":"04\/14\/17(Fri)19:12:42","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121127977\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121127977<\/a><br>truth bomb right here","time":1492211562,"resto":121127977,"id":"jYuOFrJc","country":"AU","country_name":"Australia"},{"no":121130052,"now":"04\/14\/17(Fri)19:13:30","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121127977\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121127977<\/a><br>you have to understand that USA is entangled in different kinds of problems.

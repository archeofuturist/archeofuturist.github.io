Ask yourself this: What would Assad have to gain by launching chemical weapons against civilians? NOTHING. This is simply Israel-controlled America (via President Trumpstein) trying to reverse the success that Syria and Russia have had in removing the terrorists who have been fighting violently and incessantly for over half a decade now to end Syria&#039;s sovereignty to create Greater Israel. Most of these so-called &#039;moderate Syrian rebels&#039; used to be the so-called &#039;Libyan rebels&#039; (most of whom are not even Libyan, they come from Saudi Arabia and Turkey) who were fighting in Libya before Gaddafi was overthrown and killed. After Gaddafi was overthrown and killed, the so-called &#039;Libyan rebels&#039; moved into Syria, became the so-called &#039;moderate Syrian rebels&#039; (they&#039;ll rip your heart out and eat it, but don&#039;t worry, they&#039;ll do all of that &#039;moderately&#039;) and are now trying to overthrow (and kill) the secular leader of Syria - Assad. This war in Syria is a FRAUD and a FARCE. I am anti-Israel but I am NOT a Muslim. In fact, I am VERY anti-Islam, you don&#039;t need to be a Muslim to realise that Israel has hijacked the politics of the Western World (ESPECIALLY the Jewnited States of America).

Women, minorities, and youth have proven themselves unable to be trusted with the best interests of this nation.<br>Either democracy needs to be seriously &#039;revised&#039; by repealing the 14th, 19th, 22nd, 24th and 26th amendments and returning to the 1790 Naturalization Law only allowing whites citizenship... or just have a straight up dictatorship\/theocracy... but I still prefer the Thomas Jefferson approach of restricting voting rights to whites of age with good character who own land. It seems that limited voting rights always expands until everyone one can vote and then no one can vote (dictatorship).

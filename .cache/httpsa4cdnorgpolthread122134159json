Liberals are making themselves look stupid, that is natural rather than an elaborate plot. <br><br>2. Trump is pro-Israel in the attenuated sense that he wants Jewish people to consolidate in their own nation. In this sense he is radically pro-Israel. He is not zionist in the sense that he wants a Jewish state taking over the world. <br><br>3. Trump and the populist base supporting him constitute an actual threat to the established neoliberal order. To suppose it is a plot you would have to assume that all of the emails and evidence about the globalist human trafficking regime were fabricated over the last 30 years just to get Trump elected -- an ad hoc assumption at best. <br><br>4. Trump is not anti-Muslim, and in fact he is working with Muslim businessmen and generals because they are one of the best threats against zionism and isis. <br><br>Remember, ISIS was created by the Zionists and deep state. To be anti-ISIS is to be anti-Zionist. Trump dropped the MOAB, not on random innocent Muslims, but on a facility that was literally funded by a rogue faction of the CIA. <br><br>You are worrying too soon, and there is no reason to. Relax. Watch what happens in the next year. Distinguish between the things Trump says rhetorically for theater, and the things actually done.","time":1492783606,"resto":122134159,"id":"hGbSHB9j","country":"US","country_name":"United States"}]}

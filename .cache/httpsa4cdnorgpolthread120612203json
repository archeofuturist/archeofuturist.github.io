But I have trouble finding an alternative way to state it succinctly: Our biggest weapon will have to be chaos. The current order *is* the problem, and new order cannot emerge until it is gone. We may not like the SandLanders, but their methods clearly have the West on tilt. Its a good demonstration of human reaction to the constant folly of other humans trying to establish huge international governments. Call it globalism, call it empire, call it colonialism. It just never lasts. I have a theory that Jews figured this out years ago which is why they prefer to stay in periphery as advisors and masters of institutions, not government offices directly. They survive by *not* seeking direct control. Instead they roam, disperse, and have survived for 7000 years while empires around them rise and fall.<br><a href=\"#p120613857\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120613857<\/a><br><br>Thank you.","time":1491926786,"resto":120612203,"id":"hKeVp2OS","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":120615174,"now":"04\/11\/17(Tue)12:09:16","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120612203\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120612203<\/a><br>Go live in a lawless shit hole in Africa and get killed when someone wants your jar of peanut butter bitch.

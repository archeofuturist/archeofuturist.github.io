If it were a free trade zone with close co-operation, which is what Brits thought it was when we joined in 1973, that would have been great. However, it was never meant to be that and we were lied to and deceived.","time":1491418257,"resto":119634106,"id":"1EFnJzpi","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":119639726,"now":"04\/05\/17(Wed)14:51:22","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119639468\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119639468<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;US guarantees Georgia<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Russia blatantly invades Georgia anyway<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Russia then proceeds to invade Ukraine and hold staged referendums to re-integrate territories<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Gets sanctioned<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Proceeds to do it anyway while simultaneously increasing military spending in a crashing economy<\/span><br><br>Yeah, I&#039;m sure that they have ZERO intention of restoring their Soviet borders","time":1491418282,"resto":119634106,"id":"1AzmOKLg","country":"BG","country_name":"Bulgaria"},{"no":119639853,"now":"04\/05\/17(Wed)14:52:24","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119639319\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119639319<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;In the Eu parliament there is no goverment party and no opposition<\/span><br>Literally what.

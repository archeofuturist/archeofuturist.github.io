This could be to prevent gridlock in the Commons where the government frontbench is split with the backbenchers it needs to pass a bill, and so an election could act as a single issue referendum (much like this one now). The threat of this has historically usually been enough to force backbenchers to back down. <br>It was also more useful back when the Lords had an indefinite veto and could kill any Commons bill it wanted (pre1920), and elections could be called to pressure them with a freshly mandated and elected commons.<br><br>All of this changed after the 2010 election where the paranoid Libs Dems in the LibCon coalition demanded an Act be passed making it a mandatory five year term, so that the Tories couldn&#039;t fuck them in the ass two years down the line with a snap election, but this consigning us to no more than one election every five years.<br>Yet another marker of Lib Dems being illiberal and undemocratic.

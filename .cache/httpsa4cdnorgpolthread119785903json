You just need to write a program that drives as well as the least competent driver on the road but obeys all traffic laws and never drives drunk or gets tired.","time":1491511261,"resto":119785903,"id":"NHTTMX5I","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":119791429,"now":"04\/06\/17(Thu)16:41:03","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119790473\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119790473<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;not just nipping the sentient ai overlord scenario in the bud<\/span><br>That shit always starts because they start going &quot;muh sentience.&quot;","time":1491511263,"resto":119785903,"id":"R14xjsW5","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":119791471,"now":"04\/06\/17(Thu)16:41:23","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119791094\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119791094<\/a><br>You&#039;re right.

This is actually how most online competitive games are these days. They are designed to essentially be like casinos of time where players have their biology tricked into continuing to play. The more they play, the more they validate their play by purchasing content. The entire pro scene on these games is also a marketing ploy to attract even more people to play and commit more time to the games under the flimsy dream that &quot;you too can be a pro and get played for playing video games!&quot; It&#039;s why the companies put so much time and effort into generating the scenes. The solo queue and even most multi-queue experience is almost entirely artificial and even the games themselves are balanced to make sure no one character can ever enhance the skill level of a good player enough to disrupt the system and &quot;hurt people&#039;s feelings.&quot; It&#039;s actually pretty insane how it works. Somewhere along the line someone got the brilliant idea that they could give a product away or sell it for relatively cheap, hook players like addicts, and sell them content to validate their addiction. The revenue friendly byproduct of this process is that it also will make everyone&#039;s experience in the game similar; an artificial, centrally tending sludge of sorts where the overwhelming majority of the players will be pushed towards the center of the bell curve. Most good players will eventually discover this and quit. There are patents out there on these systems that explain them and there are incidences where &quot;pros&quot; were getting their shit pushed in and the community of a MOBA was using it as evidence that the matchmaking was broken...suddenly after a patch, all of the pros were where the community wanted them to be and everything was at it should be... Video games these days, more so than ever before, are designed to create and prey on addicts.","time":1491515656,"resto":119785903,"id":"ICUbwKRp","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":119801334,"now":"04\/06\/17(Thu)17:54:22","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119794595\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119794595<\/a><br>Well at least androids are different from robots.<br>The most advanced androids are meant to basically be artificial humans with artificial flesh and blood.<br>And at least you can just genocide everyone in Fallout 4 if you wanted to.","time":1491515662,"resto":119785903,"id":"TLQeQy1E","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":119801473,"now":"04\/06\/17(Thu)17:55:24","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119798689\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119798689<\/a><br>You bet your oiled abs it is.<br>But this one isn&#039;t.<br>https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=ajP<wbr>5q2HvycY","time":1491515724,"resto":119785903,"id":"oio0vbLL","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":119801537,"now":"04\/06\/17(Thu)17:55:48","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119801268\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119801268<\/a><br>tyranids<br>the flood <br>the reapers<br>etc.","time":1491515748,"resto":119785903,"id":"o0KemUw3","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":119801579,"now":"04\/06\/17(Thu)17:56:09","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119801051\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119801051<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;touchy feely scifi like Star Trek where science has magically cured all our problems <\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;what was WW3<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;what was eugenics wars<\/span>","time":1491515769,"resto":119785903,"id":"JubAPw51","country":"FI","country_name":"Finland"},{"no":119801641,"now":"04\/06\/17(Thu)17:56:29","name":"Anonymous","com":"It&#039;s magna charta u dumb bongs","time":1491515789,"resto":119785903,"id":"hRQB+oK7","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":119801661,"now":"04\/06\/17(Thu)17:56:36","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119796079\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119796079<\/a><br>Wat.

You don&#039;t have to actually create &quot;true AI&quot; to create something dangerous, you just need to create something that reasonably simulates the behavior of AI to the point a human mostly can&#039;t tell the difference. Sort of like how you don&#039;t need to create a perfect driving AI that out performs or even matches human performance to make a successful self-driving car. You just need to write a program that drives as well as the least competent driver on the road but obeys all traffic laws and never drives drunk or gets tired.","time":1491511261,"resto":119785903,"id":"NHTTMX5I","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":119791429,"now":"04\/06\/17(Thu)16:41:03","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119790473\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119790473<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;not just nipping the sentient ai overlord scenario in the bud<\/span><br>That shit always starts because they start going &quot;muh sentience.&quot;","time":1491511263,"resto":119785903,"id":"R14xjsW5","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":119791471,"now":"04\/06\/17(Thu)16:41:23","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119791094\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119791094<\/a><br>You&#039;re right.

someone else with us. They do this to prevent mass shootings (since all mass shooting in movie theaters were committed by guys who went in by themselves) and because girls don&#039;t want creepy guys sitting next to them.<br>It&#039;s called a &quot;no singles policy&quot;.<br><br>I can&#039;t even go on a movie date with my waifu because she&#039;s not real ;_; and she doesn&#039;t count under their &quot;no-singles policy&quot;.<br>But I guess I&#039;m the type of man they make that policy for, no 3DPD would want to sit next to a creep like me.","filename":"Mahou_Shoujo_Madoka_Magica_-_02_-_Large_12","ext":".jpg","w":1280,"h":720,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":70,"tim":1491340912307,"time":1491340912,"md5":"gUijDWrL\/ge0YK3WoGxAXw==","fsize":118407,"resto":119500893,"id":"4XzkjRR8","country":"US","m_img":1,"country_name":"United States"},{"no":119518631,"now":"04\/04\/17(Tue)17:25:00","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119505625\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119505625<\/a><br>Rofl","time":1491341100,"resto":119500893,"id":"zkpAw1C\/","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":119518779,"now":"04\/04\/17(Tue)17:26:02","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119500893\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119500893<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt; paid 11 quid to see Ghost in the Shell<\/span>","time":1491341162,"resto":119500893,"id":"2leM2vzR","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":119518805,"now":"04\/04\/17(Tue)17:26:15","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119518261\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119518261<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;tfw i stopped contributing to (((hollywood))) and havent been to a theater in years and have no idea if you&#039;re being sarcastic or not<\/span>","filename":"334F6C1900000578-3546801-image-a-30_1461023352790","ext":".jpg","w":634,"h":357,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":70,"tim":1491341175094,"time":1491341175,"md5":"evDBXwhicFTHdZSwKH+jtw==","fsize":37532,"resto":119500893,"id":"lQQZQK9J","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":119518944,"now":"04\/04\/17(Tue)17:27:16","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119509224\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119509224<\/a><br><br>I live in Burnley, Reel Cinema is just a 15 minute walk down Manchester Road from my family&#039;s house. <br><br>Its definitely not grubby but its not what it used to be, it used to be an Apollo Cinema and that was decent, not to the standards of Odion or Vue but pretty good.<br><br>This shit is just hilarious <br>But it also means fucking Shia might come to Burnley","time":1491341236,"resto":119500893,"id":"biQTuECV","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":119518980,"now":"04\/04\/17(Tue)17:27:35","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119500893\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119500893<\/a><br>didn&#039;t he commit career suicide and blackball himself from hollywood a little back?

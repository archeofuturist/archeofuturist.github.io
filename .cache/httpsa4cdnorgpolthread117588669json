There&#039;s an underlying element self-hatred (while also having many supremacist elements to it) and victim complex in the Jewish culture that comes from the Talmud. Even among secular Jews, it&#039;s still permeated the culture to an extent. Judaism is also a dry, scholarly religion much like Islam, that&#039;s more about pleasing a distant king (much like Islam) rather than having a &quot;relationship&quot; with god as a father the way Christianity is--some can find fulfillment in Judaism, but I often get the feeling that many don&#039;t and felt like me deep down (but leaving the faith often upsets the family and can make one shunned among the Jewish community. Misery enjoys company as they say, so I feel like that&#039;s a huge factor as to why there are so many Jews seeking to subvert white christian civilization, and why they pursue money, and earthly riches\/power<br><br><a href=\"#p117591611\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;117591611<\/a><br>Not him<br><br><a href=\"#p117592547\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;117592547<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Have you read Brothers Karamazov and Laurus?<\/span><br><br>Yes, I read them early on in my conversion process.

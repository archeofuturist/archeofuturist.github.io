Everything can be explained by understanding gravity. Way back then, the earth was a lot younger so gravity was a lot weaker than what it is today. The stones they used did not weigh very much back then, due to the weak magnetic strength of the earth at the time. Over the years gravity has increased as the earth ages, and the stones now weigh too much for us to comprehend lifting them by hand.","filename":"USA","ext":".jpg","w":340,"h":165,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":60,"tim":1492556489594,"time":1492556489,"md5":"aRxIlFspl5Y90AaZ7BlsxA==","fsize":23702,"resto":121740985,"id":"K9SLRUB5","country":"AU","country_name":"Australia"},{"no":121756736,"now":"04\/18\/17(Tue)19:01:46","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121756181\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121756181<\/a><br>Where did Canada hide that arm after they built it if it isn&#039;t on the ISS right now? <br><br>it&#039;s in a fucking pool","time":1492556506,"resto":121740985,"id":"sLbVBDGH","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":121756908,"now":"04\/18\/17(Tue)19:02:50","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121755324\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121755324<\/a><br><a href=\"#p121755508\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121755508<\/a><br><br><br>Nasa believes the Earth is a &quot;stationary atmosphere, over a non-rotating Earth.&quot;<br><br>https:\/\/www.nasa.gov\/centers\/dryden<wbr>\/pdf\/88104main_H-1391.pdf<br><br>Go to page 35, read the concluding remarks.","filename":"unnamed","ext":".jpg","w":720,"h":720,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":125,"tim":1492556570787,"time":1492556570,"md5":"yhaHyD72POa6ypDbGZwFuQ==","fsize":114320,"resto":121740985,"id":"BQ+lgjS\/","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":121757078,"now":"04\/18\/17(Tue)19:04:01","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121740985\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121740985<\/a><br>REMEMBER ALL ROADS LEAD TO ANTARCTICA!!!!<br>https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=pq_<wbr>wzM5qTk4<br>https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=lwc<wbr>MBZwpR8E<br>https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=sdl<wbr>zxXfjCTI<br>https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=ZB_<wbr>hojp9auM","filename":"d7fb19422-1[1]","ext":".jpg","w":480,"h":360,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":93,"tim":1492556641038,"time":1492556641,"md5":"JCNuG2Gu3Iq94zQnf0mb6A==","fsize":26391,"resto":121740985,"id":"5IHXblVo","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":121757156,"now":"04\/18\/17(Tue)19:04:31","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121755621\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121755621<\/a><br>Go ahead speak then.

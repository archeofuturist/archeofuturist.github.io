It&#039;s a place where you can exist in different points simultaneously, where a region can exist, then suddenly vanish, where you can be at one point then instantly in another. There are beings there that are both many and one, shifting as necessary and taking on any number of forms. This place can be both evil and good. The individual who can access it determines its character. It reflects the individual and when the individual leaves it, they carry a part of it back to this universe with them. If you have died before, you may have taken a piece back with you and accessing this place is easier once you have been there. You may access it entirely by accident while you&#039;re awake or while you sleep even. This is how God, the afterlife, and the will of God can be interpreted so differently depending on the prophet. Once upon a time mankind was able to tap into this realm and did so more often, but society corrupted the process and those who couldn&#039;t do it became spiteful and jealous and sought to sever man&#039;s connection with this place. Nature can&#039;t be unbalanced for long though and this realm is calling out louder than at any point in recent history and is making its presence known in our universe. Most of us can &quot;feel&quot; it, but we can&#039;t put our finger on it. We know something feels off. Look at the rise of this belief that we live in a giant simulation.

The First and Second World Wars, with all of their barbarism and moral corruption, point with their accusatory fingers to the men and women of the fifth Aryan subrace.<br>Sixth subrace: The mixture of the Spanish Conquistadors with the Native American tribes.

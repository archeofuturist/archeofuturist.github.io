As someone who knows, spoke and even debated actual people from swiss communist (or authoritarian socialist) parties, most of them are old men in their 50s-60s, the only ones here younger than that (and much more relevant) belong to the Jungsozialisten party, which is more of a liberal socialist party(besides being authoritarian as fuck on social issues) and with all due respect, isn&#039;t really taken serously by commoners, only by disconnected rich kids (the irony is strong) who are luckily outnumbered in our<br>democracy.<br><br>So why is it that in america commies seem to be getting younger and younger? Or am I just mistaken in my judgement?","filename":"communist_words_and_actions_by_party9999999-d69rhrc","ext":".jpg","w":788,"h":1015,"tn_w":194,"tn_h":250,"tim":1490961727460,"time":1490961727,"md5":"xeDo8TOdT\/h2WPjxuxoIZQ==","fsize":94072,"resto":0,"id":"iFRN9BoZ","country":"CH","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"as-a-swiss-person-i-find-it-genuinely-weird-that","country_name":"Switzerland","replies":3,"images":0,"unique_ips":4},{"no":119050149,"now":"03\/31\/17(Fri)08:08:28","name":"Anonymous","com":"There are stupid people of all ages.","time":1490962108,"resto":119049732,"id":"xUJJAAFs","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":119050336,"now":"03\/31\/17(Fri)08:11:20","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119049732\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119049732<\/a><br>I think you&#039;re mistaken. Juso retards are commies as well for the most part. Read their party program. When they get older, they switch over to the SP and then infiltrate our governments from there - like that one bitch who sits in parliament now and recently said in an interview that we need to overcome capitalism. Why is no one going after this stupid cunt who&#039;s aiming the destroy the foundations of this great country? Does it really take a scheiss Jugo like me to become a politician and go after these traitorous commie infiltrators? Unbelievable. The women&#039;s march recently in Zurich made me just as mad.","time":1490962280,"resto":119049732,"id":"8C+mbiqE","country":"CH","country_name":"Switzerland"},{"no":119051298,"now":"03\/31\/17(Fri)08:25:32","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119049732\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119049732<\/a><br>Young Americans grew up through 8 years of conservaniggers calling every form of mild-mannered stop-gap liberalism &quot;socialism.&quot;<br><br>So when they look to such moderate policies (which aren&#039;t working) and consider alternatives that lie further to the left, the taboo against communism\/socialism has already been broken by red-baiting from histronic right wing pundits.","time":1490963132,"resto":119049732,"id":"tJ2xz2Mx","country":"JP","country_name":"Japan"}]}

The erosion seen on most of the Sphinx is actually water type erosion, although Egypt has not seen heavy rainfall capable of causing that type of erosion since before The Old Kingdom. That means that while it is commonly asserted that the Sphinx is 9000 years old, it is more likely between 10-12000 years old, making it before the Egyptians.","time":1491771213,"resto":120286740,"id":"h50HB0KL","country":"IE","country_name":"Ireland"},{"no":120335210,"now":"04\/09\/17(Sun)16:54:35","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120334554\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120334554<\/a><br>we cant tell how visions work, at least i never had one. maybe the wrds just flash in front of the eyes. maybe it was some timetraveler having some fun or trying to leave a hint for us so we know there is more to the world than we are being told. maybe its like i mentioned in <a href=\"#p120289141\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120289141<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;this is something i though about, what if time flows completely different from what we think? what if the past didnt really happen but only exist as some kind of information. like one cycle of humanity ends and a complete new one emerges, the information still exists even though there is no physical connection. the information somehow manifests itself resulting in some artefacts that dont make sense in the context of what we think is history and we get Out of place artifacts. for example what if this progress of history was done almost exactly like this already. another timeline, but instead of running parallel to each other they run after one another. the communist party of china is collapsed and some guy chose to carve that into a stone. the timeline ends and a new one starts. but the information of the stone somehow manifests itself into this timeline and we get this<\/span><br> at the very least its something 270 million year old created by something intelligent. if its really a prediction of the future isnt even so important. the age and the fact its created by something intelligent is imo<br><br>but yes, i did wonder myself too why this out of all the things that enthity could tell us","time":1491771275,"resto":120286740,"id":"ZUJPWUoS","country":"DE","country_name":"Germany"},{"no":120335232,"now":"04\/09\/17(Sun)16:54:46","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120331799\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120331799<\/a><br>I&#039;m from Lebanon, Baalbek is fantastic.

So atheists have to create a different way divide the labor of discovering truth. People of faith tap into the collective unconsciousness for things they don&#039;t understand while atheists replace faith in the collective unconsciousness with faith in an endlessly complicated system of (((experts))). Rather than search internally for intangible answers they just refer to the &quot;offical&quot; truth.

They think because the Christians in the past hated Jews too, that Christianity is somehow anti-Jewish, when it&#039;s based in Jewish thought and the Jewish spirit, and when modern-day Christians overwhelmingly support Israel and the Jewish people no matter what the cost. It does say in their unchanging and unadapting written tradition that they are the chosen people of god - and why would they not be. He is their god.<br><br>I think we could do better to translate paganism into conceptual language though, like Dan McCoy, Varg, and Stephen McNallen do. People are used to the Christian paradigm, and pagan gods are really not of the same nature of the all-powerful god that personifies nothing. People take religion literally so when they hear that the sound of thunder is Thor smacking giants with a hammer they can&#039;t believe it, even though the symbolism is that of a fatherly sky god that personifies strength and protection subduing the forces of invasion and ruin during a storm, which is the sky fertilizing the earth (portrayed by female goddesses) with rain, so it may &quot;give birth&quot; to crops (Thor&#039;s wife, Sif is a personification of crops) and other life that exists on earth.

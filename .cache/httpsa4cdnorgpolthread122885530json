While heavily restricted, it&#039;s possible to get a permit to carry a gun for defence if your life is in danger. This applies mosty for Security and Bodyguard type of Occupations. However, life in danger is a broader concept. Being a white german in a country flooded with rapefugges, life is getting more dangerous by the minute. <br><br>So I was thinking about to apply for a gun carry permit with a detailed report on white genocide and cultural marxism. While this will most likely will get me v&amp; and jailed, I cannot help thinking &quot;what if...&quot;. I mean, van&amp; or not, if they reject the permit I might by able to sue them and bring the redpill to court.....<br><br>Like I said, it&#039;s stupid but I just can&#039;t help thinking about it.","filename":"mp5","ext":".jpg","w":351,"h":177,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":126,"tim":1493214877872,"time":1493214877,"md5":"1W6wKccxcYhbLknwUS0RjA==","fsize":7425,"resto":0,"id":"Xf5bZBPo","country":"DE","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"okay-its-stupid-but-give-me-a-minute-while","country_name":"Germany","replies":10,"images":5,"unique_ips":8},{"no":122885701,"now":"04\/26\/17(Wed)09:56:29","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122885530\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122885530<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;rapefugges<\/span>","filename":"spurdo_face","ext":".jpg","w":600,"h":459,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":95,"tim":1493214989916,"time":1493214989,"md5":"WKsoGSR72s6ooe8ZtW2sAQ==","fsize":28335,"resto":122885530,"id":"YOJHnoQl","country":"EE","country_name":"Estonia"},{"no":122886488,"now":"04\/26\/17(Wed)10:04:52","name":"Anonymous","com":"i doubt the law sees it as such a broad concept and it probably mostly applies to specific circumstances, such as credible threats on your life, ect.<br>if you want to out yourself to your govermnet and you don&#039;t care about becoming unemployable then go ahead","time":1493215492,"resto":122885530,"id":"vmnvdlVi","country":"PL","country_name":"Poland"},{"no":122886498,"now":"04\/26\/17(Wed)10:04:55","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122885530\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122885530<\/a><br>relevant part of the German Weapons Law (I&#039;ll post in english soon)","filename":"waffg","ext":".png","w":883,"h":235,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":33,"tim":1493215495791,"time":1493215495,"md5":"waVuhpazq1gm3mW\/CR5ZyQ==","fsize":21389,"resto":122885530,"id":"Xf5bZBPo","country":"DE","country_name":"Germany"},{"no":122886503,"now":"04\/26\/17(Wed)10:04:59","name":"Anonymous","com":"Do it, you&#039;re aware and prepared for the consequences, create some desperately needed discussion.","time":1493215499,"resto":122885530,"id":"uxRQEo3H","country":"NO","country_name":"Norway"},{"no":122886581,"now":"04\/26\/17(Wed)10:05:43","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122885530\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122885530<\/a><br>If you have the time, resources and inclination then I for one would love to see you get v&amp;. <br>All jokes aside...

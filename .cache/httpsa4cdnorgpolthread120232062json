As I wrote in February, the Neocons and the US deep state have completely neutered Trump. Just look at these two headlines from RT (and read the articles):<br><br> \u2018It crossed a lot of lines\u2019: Trump on alleged chemical gas attack in Syria<br><br>\u2018We are compelled to take own action\u2019 if UN fails in Syria \u2013 US envoy<br><br>Frankly, I feel like saying \u201cQED \u2013 I rest my case\u201d and stop writing here.

The Syrians have also pretty much defeated the Anglo-Zionist-Wahabi aggression against their country (courtesy of Russia, again). There is a new (kind of) US Administration in power (some say that this was also courtesy of Russia) which appeared to have given up on overthrowing Assad. And right at this moment in time, in what is supposed to be a *pure coincidence*.<br><br> The Syrian forces used chemical weapons<br> In a location filled with children<br> and a lot of folks with cameras<br><br>How stupid do they think we are?<br><br>But, of course, it\u2019s not about us. It\u2019s about Trump. And he, alas, is proving to be the overcooked noodle he has been since, well, pretty much day 1 and ever since: flaccid, confused and spineless. And yeah, he appears be stupid alright, especially so-called \u201cplan\u201d to defeat Daesh (more about that below).<br><br>http:\/\/thesaker.is\/the-trump-admini<wbr>stration-goes-neocon-crazy\/","time":1491709807,"resto":120232062,"id":"Z+3tWvCd","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":120233332,"now":"04\/08\/17(Sat)23:52:42","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120233045\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120233045<\/a><br>And nevermind that Russian experts have been warning for along time that the \u201cgood terrorists\u201d had chemical munitions.

Problem #1 \u2013 no UNSC Resolution will back it. Neither will the Syrian government. But who cares, right?

But that is only a \u2018minor\u2019 problem. The real problem is simple:<br><br>Besides the Syrians themselves, the Russians, the Iranians and the Turks are categorically against such a plan. And these four countries just happen to represent the overwhelming military force in Syria, and all of them *already* have boots on the ground (and air defense systems). For Turkey especially, such a plan is a casus belli, they have said so many times. I am no big fan of Turkey or Erdogan (although I do like the Turkish people themselves), but I have to admit that should Trump go ahead with this goofy plan he will live no other choice then to chose between war or civil war. Mostly likely a combo of both.","time":1491709997,"resto":120232062,"id":"Z+3tWvCd","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":120233470,"now":"04\/08\/17(Sat)23:53:48","name":"Anonymous","com":"Then there are the Kurds. Actually, in many ways I feel sorry for them and I admire them. But they have to realize the enormous dangers of accepting the US plan. First, that means that they will be the frontline cannon-fodder against Daesh which happens to be one of the best trained and experienced infantry force in the region. But worse, do the Kurds really commit the same historical mistake as the Albanian of Kosovo who have 100% linked their future with Camp Bondsteel and who will be instantly re-invaded by the Serbia as soon as NATO or the US leave (which they will, sooner or later, inevitably).<br><br>There is a reason why the US always supports minorities everywhere: because by accepting and relying on that support these minorities always become completely dependent upon the USA. That, in turn, means that the US can then use these minorities in any way they want \u201cor else\u201d. And, since sooner or later the Americans leaves, the \u201cor else\u201d inevitably and always happen.<br><br>I submit that it would be the hight of folly for the Kurds to commit the same mistake. Yes, sure, they want their autonomy and\/or their own country. But they have to realize that the only viable way to achieve either objective is by negotiations with their neighbors, not some ignorant US official who will forget about them as soon as he is done promising them the moon. I would remind the Kurd of a time-honored US tradition here: as soon as things get ugly, the Americans \u201cdeclare victory and leave\u201d.<br><br>That also means that the Kurds might have to settle for less than what they want. Politics is the art of the possible. But if the choice is some viable limited autonomy vs full independence followed by an inevitable war against Turkey, Iran, Iraq and Syria then I think that the former is the best possible outcome. But even if we assume that the Kurds decide to try the \u201cKosovar option\u201d.","time":1491710028,"resto":120232062,"id":"Z+3tWvCd","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":120233552,"now":"04\/08\/17(Sat)23:54:35","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120233470\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120233470<\/a><br>Iran is the number one military power on the ground. And Hezbollah. The Syrians are struggling, I will admit to that. But they are holding and making incremental efforts, some of their best units are actually pretty good. As for the skies over Syria \u2013 they are Russian.<br><br>So far, the Americans have not re-heated the \u201cno fly zone\u201d concept, but they might as well, since their entire plan is idiotic to the extreme. Besides, I simply cannot imagine US generals agreeing to deploy their forces in Syria without air cover (in case you did not know, the US solider cannot fight without air cover. He just won\u2019t. It\u2019s \u201cair cover for me or I don\u2019t fight\u201d). However, air cover for the US forces in Syria imply either a tacit agreement with the Russians and the Syrians, something like what the Israelis apparently have, or an immense risk for the USAF and USN aircraft. So we are back to negotiating with the Russians and via the Russians, with the Syrians.<br><br>In fact, I bet you that this is what the Americans are doing right now. Quietly negotiating with the Russians. Problem: the Neocons hate Russia and everything Russian. And they loathe Putin. So how does the State Department or the White House negotiate with the Russians while, at the very same time, Congress, the US media and the CIA are all engaging into a hysterical and paranoid hate-campaign against Russia?<br><br>So here is Trump\u2019s conundrum: he desperately needs the real enemies of Daesh \u2013 Russia, Iran and Syria \u2013 to agree to his plan but at the same time, he is too much of a whip to tackle the hate campaign against, well, Russia, Iran and Syria inside the United States.","time":1491710075,"resto":120232062,"id":"Z+3tWvCd","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":120233632,"now":"04\/08\/17(Sat)23:55:22","name":"Anonymous","com":"The Neocons, apparently backed by the CIA and the Pentagon, want to go at it solo: just shoot up all of Syria \u201cOK Corral\u201d style and they seem to be convinced that they can somehow scare the Russians, the Iranians and the Syrian into submission. If so, then they are both stupid and ignorant. Or, there is even a worse possibility: the Neocons *know* that this plan will end up in disaster, but they want Trump to go to war anyway because that will destroy his presidency. That is almost elegant, in a perverted way.<br><br>What is sure is that you will never see a Neocon in frontline combat. Neither they nor their kids will die no matter what they do. Or so they think.

My fervent hope: nothing. Absolutely nothing.

I hope that the Kurds will, you know, \u201ckinda, sort of, give it a try\u201d and then stop before things go critical. Should the Kurds really decide to fight for Uncle Sam, I hope that they will keep in mind that the US will dump them as soon as Raqqa is liberated simply because really creating some kind of autonomy for the Kurds against the will of Syria, Iran and, most importantly, Turkey could result in Erdogan really slamming the door on NATO and Turkey leaving the alliance. Should that happen the only option left for Turkey would be some kind of understanding, and maybe even alliance, with Russia and Iran.

If that happens, a lot of Americans will die.<br><br>Assuming that there still is somebody rational and sane left in the Trump administration with enough influence, then all this madness can still be stopped. There is also the very real possibility that the current fight inside the US elites will drain so much energy that nobody will really have to time and energy to engage in very risky foreign military operations.

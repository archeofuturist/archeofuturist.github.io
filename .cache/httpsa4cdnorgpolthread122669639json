He clowns obama for his red line and backing down when push came to shove. There is no way in hell trump is gonna back down here if NK tests more nukes.<br><br>B) Kim is a petulant man child who truly believes he can destroy the US. Nothing in the world will stop him from testing nukes. I can assure you he is not afraid of mike pences warning. Hes a maniac. He WILL continue tests. Its not a matter of if rather than when?<br><br>Given that. We can say with a certainty a few thnings.<br>1. Kim will test more nukes<br>2.trump will retaliate the second kim tests more nukes.<br>3.North korea will respond.<br><br>This is a done fucking deal. Its a waiting game but its literally set in stone. Nothing is going to change these 2 things from occuring.<br><br>With that being said, where do we go from there? Trump strikes NK. Possibly orders SK boots to invade. but what does NK do in return? Do they nuke south korea? Do they let the nukes fly? They literally have nukes and they will use them at the drop of a hat.<br>This is a legitimate happening. This one should be watched very closely.<br><br>Name a more certain happening then this? Its never happened. Every &quot;happening&quot; had an out in the past. A way to dissolve the situation. THIS ONE HAS NO OUTS. And no its not more sanctions. This isnt obama. This is trump we are talking here. Look at his warmongering cabinet as well. Sanctions? Yeah no. <br><br>Im not saying this is WW3, but something big is about to happen, and soon. I dont know what it leads to and how quick it ends but Im certain something is to happen. If you live on the coast lines, its time to start stocking up.","filename":"170404141258-north-korea-kim-jong-un-cash-780x439","ext":".jpg","w":780,"h":439,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":140,"tim":1493082838582,"time":1493082838,"md5":"YXY70CwkSaIy5BpdEgBD7A==","fsize":137572,"resto":0,"id":"MPyKD7p1","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"happening","country_name":"United States","replies":288,"images":30,"unique_ips":136,"tail_size":50},{"no":122669916,"now":"04\/24\/17(Mon)21:16:08","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122669639\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122669639<\/a><br>He wants to get Americans killed so people like him.

He also asked Alabamians to assist by reporting any they knew. In one Night, no shit, they were gone. We went out looking for Mexicans in my city and found Zero. Of course Obama sued the State, but it was too late. The Mexicans understood they were not welcome. On the radio that week nurse&#039;s and teachers were calling in talking about the huge burden this had lifted off if their jobs and the cost savings! We did it Bros! Go ahead and talk bad about racist Alabama but I love this State, even our fucked Government. My question is:<br><br>If your Governor ask you and the citizens to help round up and to report illegal mooslims in your State, would you do it?","filename":"32EC33EF00000578-3527769-image-a-18_1460018428352.jpg.cf","ext":".jpg","w":399,"h":532,"tn_w":187,"tn_h":250,"tim":1493161920972,"time":1493161920,"md5":"lIblsf3NYMyJAuDF9oL3Zw==","fsize":29167,"resto":0,"id":"0pN0B6W+","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"would-you","country_name":"United States","replies":0,"images":0,"unique_ips":1}]}

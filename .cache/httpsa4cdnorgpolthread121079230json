Looks like arab, taliban, bollywood, taj-mahal, etc.. <br>You have to realize some interesting things about this breivik douchebag. For one he came to lithuania and opened bank account in person before his &quot;heroic&quot; acts. Right after this attack the bank in question folded even though it was elected as some sort of top bank in the world by top banking magazine a year before. Bank name was &quot;snoras&quot;. That word means nothing in lithuanian language, but in swedish language it means warning about danger of falling icicles, avalanches, etc. Not sure, but maybe it somehow ties into this global WAR-ming bullshit, showdens, storm roofs, etc. So after the bank folded the lithuanian government &quot;hired&quot; shit martini stirrers from rainbow donut in London to come clean their mess.","time":1492187628,"resto":121079230,"id":"vah0GA9w","country":"LT","country_name":"Lithuania"},{"no":121082740,"now":"04\/14\/17(Fri)12:54:47","name":"Anonymous","com":"does he still have a 3-room jail cell with playstation and gym in exchange for not being able to function as a leader to his followers outside (or inside) prison. he is under total isolation, apparently, so they &quot;bribe&quot; him and make themselves and the judges feel better by giving him some kind of man cave.","time":1492188887,"resto":121079230,"id":"o5gQgGTo","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":121082778,"now":"04\/14\/17(Fri)12:55:08","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121079230\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121079230<\/a><br>He struck too soon.","time":1492188908,"resto":121079230,"id":"NCvjdhjD","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":121082933,"now":"04\/14\/17(Fri)12:56:27","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121080353\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121080353<\/a><br>Breivik looks like a very typical eastern norwegian.","time":1492188987,"resto":121079230,"id":"2V0St2wE","country":"NO","country_name":"Norway"},{"no":121083058,"now":"04\/14\/17(Fri)12:57:35","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121080353\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121080353<\/a><br>nice try, wishful thinking on your part","time":1492189055,"resto":121079230,"id":"rqrGV+LH","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":121083108,"now":"04\/14\/17(Fri)12:58:03","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121079230\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121079230<\/a><br>St. Breivik, pray for us.","time":1492189083,"resto":121079230,"id":"z1NpUZ3n","country":"CA","country_name":"Canada"},{"no":121083158,"now":"04\/14\/17(Fri)12:58:28","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121079230\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121079230<\/a><br>Garlic bread","time":1492189108,"resto":121079230,"id":"yEd8W\/2X","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":121083679,"now":"04\/14\/17(Fri)13:02:36","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121082740\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121082740<\/a><br>They won&#039;t let you send him letters any more unless you&#039;ve already been in contact.

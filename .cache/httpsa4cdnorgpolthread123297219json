Pope Paschal II, taking up where his predecessor Pope Urban II left off, preached another crusade to aid the fledgling Kingdom of Jerusalem. He called in particular upon those who had taken but failed to fulfill the crusader vow but had not fulfilled it, whom he threatened with excommunication, and those who had left the First Crusade before it reached Jerusalem (the \u201cfaint-hearted\u201d). The result was another large, disorganized crusade, even more heterogeneous and far less successful than the First. The largest contingent was townspeople and peasants from Lombardy (northern Italy). Others came from various parts of France and Germany. Among the Crusades\u2019 leaders were Count Stephen of Blois and Count Hugh of Vermandois, both seeking to restore the honor they had lost by leaving the First Crusade prematurely. (Stephen\u2019s ignominious flight from the Crusade during the dark days of the siege of Antioch mortified his wife Countess Adela, the daughter of King William the Conqueror; she nagged him into going back to restore her honor.] The crusade of 1101 was almost annihilated in Asia Minor by the Seljuqs.","filename":"DEUS","ext":".jpg","w":610,"h":374,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":76,"tim":1493443543492,"time":1493443543,"md5":"HMQZbLQ75Y0y8OzyGz9lWw==","fsize":70186,"resto":123297219,"id":"m3xVXweh","country":"AU","country_name":"Australia"},{"no":123300253,"now":"04\/29\/17(Sat)01:28:35","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123297219\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123297219<\/a><br><br>The Battle of Vienna. <br><br>Turkish armies had swept across Europe, and Vienna was besieged by 150,000 muslims. <br><br>The Ottomans had several mines planted under the walls to detonate them and bring them down, with vicious battles being fought by the Christians to disarm them and hold the city.<br><br>The Polish infantry arrives, and pitched battle ensues, with the Turks gaining the upper hand. <br><br>Then, to the roaring cheers of Austrian and Polish infantry the Christian cavalry arrives, slowly emerging from the nearby forest. <br><br>They join the battle, and the Christian soldiers gained the advantage.<br><br>Then at 6pm, 18,000 horsemen, led by 3000 Polish Winged Hussars charged down the hillside into the Turkish army in the largest cavalry charge in human history. <br><br>Under assault from all sides, from a Christian coalition including Austrians, Hungarians, Polish, Bavarians, Italians, Saxons, Normans and many more the Turkish army paniced and was slaughtered.<br><br>The muslim defeat was so great that no Islamic army has set foot in Europe since, and led to the decline of the Ottoman Empires western expansion.","time":1493443715,"resto":123297219,"id":"79arWn+C","country":"AU","country_name":"Australia"},{"no":123300338,"now":"04\/29\/17(Sat)01:29:38","name":"Anonymous","com":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Massa<wbr>cre_at_B%C3%A9ziers<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;To our amazement, crying &quot;to arms, to arms!&quot;, within the space of two or three hours they crossed the ditches and the walls and B\u00e9ziers was taken.

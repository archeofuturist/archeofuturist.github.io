Pope Paschal II, taking up where his predecessor Pope Urban II left off, preached another crusade to aid the fledgling Kingdom of Jerusalem. He called in particular upon those who had taken but failed to fulfill the crusader vow but had not fulfilled it, whom he threatened with excommunication, and those who had left the First Crusade before it reached Jerusalem (the \u201cfaint-hearted\u201d). The result was another large, disorganized crusade, even more heterogeneous and far less successful than the First. The largest contingent was townspeople and peasants from Lombardy (northern Italy). Others came from various parts of France and Germany. Among the Crusades\u2019 leaders were Count Stephen of Blois and Count Hugh of Vermandois, both seeking to restore the honor they had lost by leaving the First Crusade prematurely.

The Church knows his life story thanks to his biographer, St. Athanasius, the bishop of Alexandria. \u201cWhen we visited St. Anthony in the ruins where he lived, we heard a commotion, thousands of voices and the clash of arms. Also, at night, wild beasts would come, and the saint fought them off with prayer,\u201d said Athanasius.<br><br>He Spent the Night Alone in an Abandoned Tomb<br><br>One day Saint Anthony, then aged 35, decided to spend the night alone in an abandoned tomb. A great multitude of demons came and started beating him, wounding him all over. He lay on the ground as if dead. The claws of the demons prevented him from getting up. According to the hermit the suffering caused by this demonic torture was comparable to no other. The next day, by the Providence of God, a friend came to visit him and carried him on his shoulders to the nearest village for treatment. Anthony came to himself and begged his friend to bring him back to the tomb. Upon arriving there, Saint Anthony exclaimed: \u201cHere is Anthony. I do not flee your beatings nor pain, nor torture; nothing can separate me from the love of God.\u201d<br><br>St. Athanasius wrote: \u201cThe demons made such a racket that the whole place was shaken, knocking over the four walls of the tomb; they came in droves, taking the form of all kinds of monstrous beasts and hideous reptiles. And the whole place was filled with lions, bears, leopards, bulls, wolves, asps, scorpions. The lions roared, ready to attack; bulls seemed to threaten him with their horns; snakes advanced, crawling on the ground, seeking a place of attack, and wolves prowled around him.","time":1493444797,"resto":123297219,"id":"Bx01O7kz","country":"BR","country_name":"Brazil"},{"no":123301811,"now":"04\/29\/17(Sat)01:46:58","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123301782\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123301782<\/a><br><br> They all were making a terrible noise. Groaning in pain, St. Anthony faced the demons, laughing: \u2018If you had any power, only one of you would be enough to kill me; but the Lord has taken away your strength, so you want to frighten me by your number. The proof of your powerlessness is that you are reduced to taking the form of senseless animals. If you have any power against me, come on, attack me! But if you cannot do anything, why torment yourselves unnecessarily? My faith in God is my defense against you.\u2019<br><br>\u201cBut all of a sudden a bright light illuminated the tomb; at that moment, the demons vanished. The pains ceased. When he realized that God was coming to his aid, he asked: \u2018Where were you, Lord? Why did you not stop this suffering earlier?\u2019 God answered him, \u2018Anthony, I was present at your side. But I waited, observing your fight. And since you have resisted so bravely, I will now always be at your side, and I will make your name famous throughout the world.\u2019 Having heard the words of the Lord, the monk stood up and prayed.

Stephen accused Formosus of perjury and of having acceded to the papacy illegally. At the end of the trial, Formosus was pronounced guilty and his papacy retroactively declared null.<br><br>Probably around January 897, Stephen VI ordered that the corpse of his predecessor Formosus be removed from its tomb and brought to the papal court for judgement. With the corpse propped up on a throne, a deacon was appointed to answer for the deceased pontiff.<br><br>Formosus was accused of transmigrating sees in violation of canon law, of perjury, and of serving as a bishop while actually a layman. Eventually, the corpse was found guilty. Liutprand and other sources say that, after having the corpse stripped of its papal vestments, Stephen then cut off the three fingers of the right hand that it had used in life for blessings, next formally invalidating all of Formosus&#039; acts and ordinations (including, ironically, his ordination of Stephen VI as bishop of Anagni). The body was finally interred in a graveyard for foreigners, only to be dug up once again, tied to weights, and cast into the Tiber River.","time":1493446726,"resto":123297219,"id":"2HrRBUK+","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":123304470,"now":"04\/29\/17(Sat)02:19:43","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123304086\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123304086<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;islam is cool<\/span><br><br>just behead me already senpai","time":1493446783,"resto":123297219,"id":"PKqNfcEW","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":123304540,"now":"04\/29\/17(Sat)02:20:34","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123304223\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123304223<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;The generals are enemies, change must come from the Corporals and below.<\/span><br>In other words, the Praetorian Guard is being put up by the next down.

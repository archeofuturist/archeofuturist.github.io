However, these were mostly based on population estimates, rather than accurate denominator data. This study aimed to document the prevalence of these rare metabolic diseases, employing data from the All Ireland Health Study census and subsequent birth cohort study (2007-2011). The prevalences for Hurler disease, Phenyketonuria, Galactosaemia and Brittle Bone Disease were 1.3, 1.3, 2.6 and 1.9 per 1,000 Traveller children respectively. Other recorded diseases were Mucolipidosis type II, Marfan\u2019s syndrome, Charcot-Marie-Tooth, Phenyketonuria and Byler\u2019s Disease. These, however, may be an under-estimated numbers and also highlights the limitations in rare diseases epidemiology. There is a limited newborn screening service in the Republic of Ireland; given the higher prevalence of these metabolic diseases among the Travellers, a Traveller-specific prevention strategy should be considered. Services should also be sensitive to the needs of the population.<\/span>","time":1492822706,"resto":122192718,"id":"tw4wS1ci","country":"ES","country_name":"Spain"}]}

You have people who are having crises of Self, sometimes coupled with sexual anxiety, and when faced with many nagging questions and feelings of inadequacy, the sensation that all is not quite right, they discover that in greater society these feelings have been mated with the male\/female dichotomy. So they start probing the notion of &quot;gender&quot; and losing themselves in that search, without ever addressing the root cause of their anxieties in the first place. Deep down they realize this, which is why it&#039;s extremely difficult for a &quot;gender-confused&quot; person to find any kind of satisfaction and catharsis, because they are quite literally looking in the wrong direction.<br><br>&quot;Gender&quot; is just a red herring, a misnomer for some kind of existential identity signifier that has nothing to do with biological sex.","time":1493365588,"resto":123149002,"id":"NqX9ZO+C","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":123166433,"now":"04\/28\/17(Fri)03:48:00","name":"Anonymous","com":"Mother told me that I&#039;m boy, but I identify myself as A-10<br>Brrrtttrttrttttrt","time":1493365680,"resto":123149002,"id":"6NwVwe12","country":"RU","country_name":"Russian Federation"},{"no":123167062,"now":"04\/28\/17(Fri)03:56:14","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123159417\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123159417<\/a><br>That TurnerSyndrome looks like a fucking real life dwarf","time":1493366174,"resto":123149002,"id":"stYSumza","country":"DE","country_name":"Germany"},{"no":123167224,"now":"04\/28\/17(Fri)03:58:08","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123167062\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123167062<\/a><br>Looks more like the Innsmouth look to me.","time":1493366288,"resto":123149002,"id":"goGB2e3p","country":"NZ","country_name":"New Zealand"},{"no":123167672,"now":"04\/28\/17(Fri)04:03:36","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123151802\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123151802<\/a><br>Can I get a link to this experiment?

In my view, it&#039;s a decayed country. And they have their racial problem, and the problem of social inequalities. Those were what caused the downfall of Rome, and yet Rome was a solid edifice that stood for something. Moreover, the Romans were inspired by great ideas. Nothing of the sort in England to-day. As for the Americans, that kind of thing is non-existent. That&#039;s why, in spite of everything, I like an Englishman a thousand times better than an American. It goes without saying that we have no affinities with the Japanese. They&#039;re too foreign to us, by their way of living, by their culture. But my feelings against Americanism are feelings of hatred and deep repugnance. I feel myself more akin to any European country, no matter which. Everything about the behaviour of American society reveals that it&#039;s half Judaised, and the other half negrified. How can one expect a State like that to hold together\u2014a State where 80 per cent of the revenue is drained away for the public purse\u2014a country where everything is built on the dollar? From this point of view, I consider the British State very much superior.&quot;","filename":"409810744_03ba4fd841","ext":".jpg","w":378,"h":480,"tn_w":196,"tn_h":250,"tim":1492880820622,"time":1492880820,"md5":"sUF+NxzvKM\/t+17Uc2Zi3w==","fsize":81513,"resto":0,"id":"r3iOEAH9","country":"AR","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"america-the-ultimate-degenerate-country-according","country_name":"Argentina","replies":8,"images":4,"unique_ips":9},{"no":122299348,"now":"04\/22\/17(Sat)13:08:21","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122299198\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122299198<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;I don&#039;t see much future for the Americans <\/span><br>How did ww2 work out for him","time":1492880901,"resto":122299198,"id":"u9dH1Wyx","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":122299383,"now":"04\/22\/17(Sat)13:08:36","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122299198\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122299198<\/a><br>Thanks to Jews","time":1492880916,"resto":122299198,"id":"n0\/3w4oJ","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":122299425,"now":"04\/22\/17(Sat)13:08:57","name":"Anonymous","filename":"IMG_0232","ext":".jpg","w":1368,"h":1121,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":102,"tim":1492880937151,"time":1492880937,"md5":"5aCV7VFz0xBrrC+Ppsgd7A==","fsize":326972,"resto":122299198,"id":"bXN1\/o8F","country":"US","m_img":1,"country_name":"United States"},{"no":122299499,"now":"04\/22\/17(Sat)13:09:38","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122299198\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122299198<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Hit**r, that pathetic one-balled impotent talentless virgin loser and degenerate junkie who couldn&#039;t tolerate someone calling his shitty paintings shitty and failed fucking art school so killed even their women and children to fulfil his pathetic ego and who committed suicide when faced with defeat like an absolute coward<\/span><br>Ok.

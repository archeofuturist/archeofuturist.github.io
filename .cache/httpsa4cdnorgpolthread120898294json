The survivability of airbases in the event of a mass surface-to-surface missile attack is also open to question. One possibility is that no large-scale air battles would materialize.<br><br>The two key limitations are logistical: lack of internal fuel to operate without support, and insufficient missiles to tackle superior numbers. For the time being, there is no obvious fix to the fuel problem: the latest U.S. fighters, the F-22 and F-35, are simply going to depend on tankers. Some suggest that the Navy should deploy light-weight low-observable drones from carriers that could potentially operate further afield.<br><br>What about increasing missile capacity?<br><br>The U.S. military is a big proponent of networked warfare. In theory, if one airplane detects an enemy, it could pass on that data to friendly ships and aircraft\u2014and through Cooperative Engagement Ability, even potentially allow those friendlies to shoot at that target from far away. One potential tactic is to use a vanguard of stealthy fighters to identify incoming enemy aircraft and send targeting data to ships or non-stealth fighters, which can carry heavier weapons loads. The F-35\u2019s excellent sensors and datalinks could make it effective in this role.<br><br>There is even an idea being kicked around to mount large numbers of missiles on a B-1 or B-52, which would be fired off hundreds of kilometers away from the battle. Of course, such an \u201carsenal plane\u201d would be vulnerable if enemy fighters broke through the accompanying line of F-22s and F-35s. The tactic would likely require even longer-range missiles than the U.S. currently employs.","filename":"Screen Shot 2017-04-13 at 1.07.39 PM","ext":".png","w":1480,"h":1166,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":196,"tim":1492082181369,"time":1492082181,"md5":"Z6Q6nlRqVo1WyBY1IrfkIg==","fsize":1604325,"resto":0,"id":"\/jFzrKaA","country":"DE","m_img":1,"bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"were-the-f22-and-f35-a-mistake","country_name":"Germany","replies":77,"images":12,"unique_ips":39},{"no":120898733,"now":"04\/13\/17(Thu)07:21:57","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120898294\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120898294<\/a><br>f22s are an (((expensive))) meme<br><br>Russia&#039;s superior Sukhoi master race aircraft could easily drop that piece of shit, especially the PAK FA","filename":"Infogr\u00e1fico-comparativo-Sukhoi-T-50-PAK-FA-Ria-Novosti","ext":".jpg","w":900,"h":983,"tn_w":114,"tn_h":125,"tim":1492082517507,"time":1492082517,"md5":"uREBdgKaSqogvuWFdYlXxw==","fsize":121098,"resto":120898294,"id":"NEofuS8M","country":"NZ","country_name":"New Zealand"},{"no":120898746,"now":"04\/13\/17(Thu)07:22:11","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120898294\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120898294<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Already, many theorists believe that carriers would be forced to remain far away from hostile shores.<\/span><br><br>Naval doctrine is that the carriers are sovereign US territory, no different than a state.

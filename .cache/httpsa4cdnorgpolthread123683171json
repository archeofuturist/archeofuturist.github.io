Maybe a half of dozen times, maybe more. So it was some time after 9\/11. War on terror, color coded threats, Afghanistan, Iraq war, etc.. I&#039;ve never paid any attention to politics, but 9\/11 changed that. So Michael Moore was interesting object to investigate. So i downloaded form p2p and watched all his movies and tv shows that he ever produced. They were quite refreshing in comparison to all this hysteria and foxnews. Even Bill O&#039;Reilly sounded to me like a voice of reason. So one evening after he was exiting the bathroom and walking by the pantry station i told him that i&#039;m his big fan and i&#039;ve watched all his material. You know what was his responce - where did you get it as if i did something wrong. That was strange to me, not because he didn&#039;t care about fans. He sounded concerned as if I didn&#039;t pay for it or something like that. Anyhow I lost any respect for him after I watched Fahrenheit 911.","time":1493678617,"resto":123683171,"id":"WFbLbeES","country":"LT","country_name":"Lithuania"},{"no":123685437,"now":"05\/01\/17(Mon)18:43:52","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123683171\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123683171<\/a><br>When is he going full trans?","time":1493678632,"resto":123683171,"id":"9e\/jzeIP","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":123686215,"now":"05\/01\/17(Mon)18:49:54","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123683171\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123683171<\/a><br>The only thing this fucker is bringing down is the buffet table","time":1493678994,"resto":123683171,"id":"B05DeS53","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":123686319,"now":"05\/01\/17(Mon)18:50:44","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123683171\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123683171<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt; When you try your hardest to convince people you are important<\/span>","time":1493679044,"resto":123683171,"id":"09hQtzlh","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":123686556,"now":"05\/01\/17(Mon)18:52:39","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123683171\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123683171<\/a><br>can subway shop bring down a fat always sitting down &quot;filmmaker&quot;?","time":1493679159,"resto":123683171,"id":"6kv3ZyNY","country":"CA","country_name":"Canada"},{"no":123687281,"now":"05\/01\/17(Mon)18:58:48","name":"Anonymous","com":"That&#039;s one sad looking dyke.","time":1493679528,"resto":123683171,"id":"xuLsCUre","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":123687575,"now":"05\/01\/17(Mon)19:01:07","name":"Anonymous","com":"Everyone of his movies was a lie.

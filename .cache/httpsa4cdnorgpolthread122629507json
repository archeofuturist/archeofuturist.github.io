Hubble had already used this knowledge in his 1924 discovery that the Andromeda nebula, containing a variable star, was more than 900,000 light years from Earth -- way beyond our own galaxy -- a surprise to everyone at the time. With this scale and other tools, Hubble had found and measured 23 other galaxies out to a distance of about 20 million light years.&quot; <\/span><br>If space does not exist, how do you account for the many signs that there are clear distances between the stars? If space is just a fabrication for us to look at and all exists on one spatial plane, there would be no outward distance between stars, only horizontal distance. <br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;everything was created accidently<\/span><br>This is one major problem I have with flat earthers: you make these logical leaps for your opponents. &quot;If the big bang happened, the universe is an accident&quot;, &quot;if the Earth isn&#039;t the only place that exists, then humans aren&#039;t special&quot;. Many Christians believe that even if the universe is comprised of billions of galaxies that humans are still extremely important and special because we resemble the characteristics of God\/are made in His image. No amount of space can devalue that. Also, the big bang may simply be the form of creation, the method for bringing matter into being, and not some weird cosmic accident.

Earth is the only PLANET (PLAIN-T) and this world we live on was created by something\/someone, the whole Big Bang, everything was created accidently, space is always expanding theory is BULLSHIT.<br><br>Personal question: If people around the world found out that there is only one earth and no space. Would people allow the rich and powerful to destroy our home, EARTH?<br><br>If people knew that we were created with a purpose and that THERE IS a life after death. Would people waste any time? Would people change if everyone knew for sure that they would be judged by god? <br><br>So many people say, &quot;Why would NASA lie?&quot;. These people don&#039;t realize that the government have been trying to find ways to control the public. What better way than showing and teaching all of the slaves only what they want to learn. Why control people through aggression when you can just trick them all into loving you and following you.","filename":"WOW","ext":".jpg","w":1400,"h":800,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":142,"tim":1493063968266,"time":1493063968,"md5":"eILVopYTlIsyrktwKWf6Yw==","fsize":164042,"resto":0,"id":"52KsVYK2","country":"US","m_img":1,"bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"flat-earth","country_name":"United States","replies":1,"images":0,"unique_ips":2},{"no":122631030,"now":"04\/24\/17(Mon)16:12:20","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122629507\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122629507<\/a><br>pol also doesn&#039;t believe in climate change, what do you expect?<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;inb4 muh fluctuating Co2 levels :^)<\/span>","time":1493064740,"resto":122629507,"id":"AONwl7Tc","country":"AU","country_name":"Australia"}]}

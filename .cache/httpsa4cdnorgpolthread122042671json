Close friend Chris Morris stated that both Eric and Dylan were extremely racist and Eric especially was described as racist by several witnesses in police reports on the case, as well as being described as an admirer of Hitler and the nazis, though some witnesses also state that they didn\u2019t recognize this behavior in neither of the boys. What can be concluded from Eric\u2019s own writings though is that he did, in fact, have nazi beliefs, and that he did feel a certain way about not only non-whites but also about homosexuals, disabled people and others he considered as \u201cuseless\u201d members of society.<\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt; For example, he referred to \u201cniggers and spics and chinks\u201d in one journal entry, expressed hatred towards blacks and gays in another one, wrote about Hitler and loving the Nazis in yet another journal entry and commented \u201cnigger=darkie=Rastus=coon\u201d and \u201cnone are equal\/pure discrimination\u201d in his planner.

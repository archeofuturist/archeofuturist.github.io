Close friend Chris Morris stated that both Eric and Dylan were extremely racist and Eric especially was described as racist by several witnesses in police reports on the case, as well as being described as an admirer of Hitler and the nazis, though some witnesses also state that they didn\u2019t recognize this behavior in neither of the boys. What can be concluded from Eric\u2019s own writings though is that he did, in fact, have nazi beliefs, and that he did feel a certain way about not only non-whites but also about homosexuals, disabled people and others he considered as \u201cuseless\u201d members of society.<\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt; For example, he referred to \u201cniggers and spics and chinks\u201d in one journal entry, expressed hatred towards blacks and gays in another one, wrote about Hitler and loving the Nazis in yet another journal entry and commented \u201cnigger=darkie=Rastus=coon\u201d and \u201cnone are equal\/pure discrimination\u201d in his planner.

I thought I had seen it all, growing up on 4chan and all, but this fucking group had me sitting with an open mouth in shock.<br><br>One of the most memorable posts I read in the group was a fat girl who had created a happy birthday montage picture for Dylan Klebold&#039;s MOTHER. In the collage, consisting of four pictures, she had one picture of Dylan himself, one of his mother, and two of HERSELF cosplaying as Harris and Klebold, respectively, wearing the same clothes they wore during the shooting. The level of insanity you have to be on to convince yourself you belong in a collage tribute to one of the shooter&#039;s moms, which is rather insane in itself, is out of this world.<br><br>I had lurked the group for a week out of curiosity, watching all these wierd fucks getting tattoos of the surveillance camera from the cafeteria during the event, but this made me get the fuck out of the group.<br><br>People are fucking crazy.","time":1492727227,"resto":122042671,"id":"wsyQ+WhL","country":"SE","country_name":"Sweden"},{"no":122054823,"now":"04\/20\/17(Thu)18:28:01","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122042671\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122042671<\/a><br>Bullied by Chads.","time":1492727281,"resto":122042671,"id":"3uY+e53g","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":122054961,"now":"04\/20\/17(Thu)18:28:52","name":"Anonymous","com":"Fucking useless, dipshitted mods.","time":1492727332,"resto":122042671,"id":"j7nnlX8j","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":122055181,"now":"04\/20\/17(Thu)18:30:27","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122052421\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122052421<\/a><br>Yeah you&#039;re an edgy beta cuck that worships these cretins","time":1492727427,"resto":122042671,"id":"rz7ij36Z","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":122055298,"now":"04\/20\/17(Thu)18:31:19","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122042671\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122042671<\/a><br>Jews.","time":1492727479,"resto":122042671,"id":"R5Z+z2dc","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":122055359,"now":"04\/20\/17(Thu)18:31:43","name":"Anonymous","com":"they hated normies such as jocks, religious ppl, etc.","time":1492727503,"resto":122042671,"id":"DNYWMxHC","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":122055603,"now":"04\/20\/17(Thu)18:33:21","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122054713\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122054713<\/a><br>go on encyclopedia dramatica and search for Columbiners. <br><br>and people call me crazy.","time":1492727601,"resto":122042671,"id":"TT7CsKZj","country":"SE","country_name":"Sweden"},{"no":122055646,"now":"04\/20\/17(Thu)18:33:36","name":"Anonymous","com":"Go say hi to swaglord.

Every single U.S President has been in the elite class while every single Canadian Prime Minister has been a proletariat before becoming Prime Minster. Also it&#039;s common for billionaires to ride the subway to work and go to regular bars and restaurants, and it&#039;s common for janitors to own houses and cars. Canada is close to a socialist paradise.<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Healthcare<\/span><br>I think this is obvious. Canadians have free healthcare while American healthcare is so expensive the average person goes broke on medical bills. Insurance company fucks the government and people in the ass while the proletariat go broke. Yes Canadian healthcare has longer waiting line but at least we get our healthcare without going broke.<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;No Prison Industrial Complex<\/span><br>Canada doesn&#039;t send people to prison at a tremendous pace like America. America has a system where you make one mistake and you go to prison for life which drains the taxpayers and makes private prison owners rich as hell. That is not right.<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;pic related based Canada<\/span><br><br>https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=mWQ<wbr>f13B8epw","filename":"Canada","ext":".jpg","w":400,"h":549,"tn_w":182,"tn_h":250,"tim":1492915161621,"time":1492915161,"md5":"aSLQySXSt\/Kh8ouFxCUEHw==","fsize":135842,"resto":0,"id":"wICaicNR","country":"CA","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"why-canada-is-better-and-more-civil-than-america","country_name":"Canada","replies":5,"images":0,"unique_ips":5},{"no":122368610,"now":"04\/22\/17(Sat)22:53:38","name":"Anonymous","com":"BRRRRAAAAAAAAAPPPPPP","time":1492916018,"resto":122366824,"id":"XSXW8A7x","country":"CA","country_name":"Canada"},{"no":122368720,"now":"04\/22\/17(Sat)22:54:36","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122366824\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122366824<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Canada is better than America<\/span><br>What would happen if your pussy nation fought my alpha one?","time":1492916076,"resto":122366824,"id":"2aBpLNn\/","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":122369116,"now":"04\/22\/17(Sat)22:58:06","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122366824\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122366824<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;it&#039;s common for billionaires to ride the subway to work<\/span><br>Because their &quot;Billions&quot; are worth a couple hundred thousand in the USA.

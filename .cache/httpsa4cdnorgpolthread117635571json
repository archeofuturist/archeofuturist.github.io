A startup can be considered a conspiracy. Any company can be considered a conspiracy.

Christ asks his disciples to tell him what people are saying about him and who they are saying he is. They tell him, &quot;John the Baptist, Elijah, Jeremiah, a prophet, and other names, etc., blah blah blah.&quot; Then he asks Simon, again, one of his disciples, who he is and he replies, &quot;Like, you&#039;re the Christ, dude.&quot; Which, of course he would because he wouldn&#039;t be following him if he didn&#039;t believe in him. Duh. And then Jesus says, &quot;And I tell you that you are Peter (which literally meant the word Rock), and on this rock I will build my Church, and the gates of Hell will not prevail against it. I will give you the keys of the kingdom of heaven. Whatever you bind on earth will be bound in heaven, and whatever you loose on earth will be loosed in heaven.&quot; <br><br>&quot;Great!&quot; The &quot;Catholic&quot; Church says. &quot;Peter is clearly the first Pope! Everyone needs to follow Peter. We are the direct spiritual line from Peter! Therefore, ergo, vis-a-vis, concordantly, we are right.&quot;<br><br>Really?<br><br>Then why, in God&#039;s name, less than 4 verses later (LESS THAN 4 VERSES LATER), would Jesus turn to Peter and say, &quot;Get behind Me, Satan! You are a stumbling block to Me. For you do not have in mind the things of God, but the things of men.\u201d\u2026<br><br>Sure, I guess if you&#039;re a retarded &quot;Catholic&quot;, you&#039;d think this was a genius thing to build your entire Church on.

Let&#039;s look at the vast amount of other arguments against the &quot;Papacy&quot; and the &quot;Catholic&quot; Church as it became known and corrupted as early as the 1st century. <br><br>Nowhere is it declared that Peter was in authority over the other apostles or over the church. Even from Peter himself (1 Peter 5:1-5). All Peter himself said was to be a good example. That&#039;s it. No authority over anyone. This makes me deeply respect Peter, and believe him to be a great man, but that does not mean he is the first Pope, and the &quot;Catholic&quot; Church is the only way to Heaven. <br><br>Nowhere does Scripture state that in order to keep the church from error, the authority of the apostles was passed on to those they ordained. What Scripture DOES teach is that false teachings would arise even from among church leaders and that Christians were to compare the teachings of these later church leaders with Scripture, which alone is cited in the Bible as infallible. The Bible does not teach that the apostles were infallible. It is not WHO teaches but it is WHAT is being taught that determines truth from error.<br><br>The &quot;Catholic&quot; Church constantly argues the NEED for apostolic succession as logically necessary in order for God to unerringly guide the church, but Scripture specifically states that God has provided for His church.","time":1490124037,"resto":117635571,"id":"Y+K5LTCV","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":117658820,"now":"03\/21\/17(Tue)15:20:47","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p117658586\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;117658586<\/a><br>Catholicism is what Jesus founded and the early Catholics were killed bythe Romans.

Hinduism was influenced by Zoroastrianism, just like Abrahamic religions and tons of other religions and pagan mythologies are, and that&#039;s basically just ancient Indo European culture. All of it was born from an older religion. It just sounds so different to you because the religions are designed for the people who are following them, the Indian people or the Southeast Asian people had a totally different way of life from people in the West so these spiritual ideas have to be explained in a totally different way, they just see metaphysical and philosophical things differently but they&#039;re all still describing the same inherent principles. The world is nuanced but I guess if it&#039;s not simple and obvious enough for you then it doesn&#039;t count.<br><br>There isn&#039;t invisible karma, do you not understand what sin is? Do you not understand why humans were cast out of the garden of Eden when they partook in the fruit? Why do you think God emphasized that they had done this to themselves, that they would be cursed for generations? <br><br>You should calm down and stop acting like such a triggered Tumblrina. If you&#039;re such an enlightened Buddhist, try acting like one and control your anger instead of getting worked up over a totally petty conversation.","time":1490125266,"resto":117635571,"id":"y4IQo\/bz","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":117660753,"now":"03\/21\/17(Tue)15:41:11","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p117660261\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;117660261<\/a><br><br>The problem arises when you try to make God into something specific.

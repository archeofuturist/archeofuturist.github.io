There was a civilization of humans before us that died out around 8000-12000 years ago in a cataclysmic event. In that event the humans who survived lost consciousness and as the smartest ones slowly regained it they created systems that relied on this ancient knowledge and which could easily be used to manipulate people and slowly coalesce them back into society (not necessarily all bad things). Jesus, Buddha, Mohammed, etc. all were created using archetypes from the previous generation. Look at the symbolism in these religions and in ancient polyglyphs.

If you think about it a conspiracy is really any organization of people or things that does things without others having the explicit knowledge of all those ongoings. A startup can be considered a conspiracy. Any company can be considered a conspiracy. A biological cell, indeed, with its definition as being an object that maintains an internal environment different from its outside, can be considered a conspiracy. Now take this from our point N and do a dynamic programming type thing in your head back to point 0, wherever you decide that may be, whether it is in the dawn of cellular biology or in the dawn of human consciousness. What does that imply to you? How can you imagine humanity will develop and has it developed in that way? If so, is your model wrong or are there things in the human world you cannot necessarily observe? Conspiracies are a natural part of life. Information hiding is necessary to distinguish living things from nature.

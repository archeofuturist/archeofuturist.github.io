Mobile providers and TV transmitters have to buy licenses for big money to be able to serve at that frequencies undisrupted. Not quite possible for the little man&#039;s wireless such as 802.11 WiFi, so they always have to resort to &quot;junk&quot; frequency bands polluted by industrial applications. For example, the 2.4 GHz band interferes with microwave ovens, 5GHz band interferes with weather radars.<br><br>The first WiFi standard developed was actually 802.11a, with plenty of channels in the 5GHz band. It was delayed because it was discovered it had a very bad influence on radar installations, so both military and air traffic control were affected. It has been delayed and so instead we got the pretty crippled 802.11b first (and later .11g) that operated in the junk 2.4GHz band.<br><br>Only after 802.11h amendment has provided measures to avoid interference with radars, .11a was approved. And later .11n that also operates in 5GHz band. The .11h standard defines that the APs must detect radar interference and switch to other channels in such case. All these standards have been joined together to IEEE 802.11-2007 release. Obviously there are always shit implementations that won&#039;t follow it correctly. Also possibly other stuff that interferes at 5 GHz","time":1492955957,"resto":122423953,"id":"Yqy5w27h","country":"DE","country_name":"Germany"},{"no":122427128,"now":"04\/23\/17(Sun)10:03:29","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122426665\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122426665<\/a><br>Almost huge gets.<br><br>Thanks man, so what your&#039;e saying is that the radar is picking up the network interference from the city of Morristown.

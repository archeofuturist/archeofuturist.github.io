But a high-IQ person is benefitted more when corrupt deep state elitists rule rather than when corrupt populist con men rule. Deep state elitists keep the ship of state stable. On the other hand, populist demagogues promise all sorts of nice sounding things but when they take charge you get guillotines, Glorious People&#039;s Republics, fascism (which is just a different version of Glorious People&#039;s Republic), and so on.<br>Elites are basically benefitted by stable capitalism, not populist bullshit.<br>This is also why Sanders lost. His supporters cry and cry but what they don&#039;t understand is that America is a rich country and not everyone is a peasant like them and like Trump-supporting hicks. Trump was helped, unlike Sanders, by also appealing to upper middle class people by running to some extent as a standard Republican (= promise of cutting taxes). Sanders, on the other hand, didn&#039;t offer anything to anyone above the peasant level, so people voted for Hill instead.","time":1490713599,"resto":118649875,"id":"DeRsRlf3","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":118657441,"now":"03\/28\/17(Tue)11:09:06","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118650004\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118650004<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;people like to status whore and signal how good they are<\/span><br>Yep.<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;High IQ <\/span><br>No.<br><br>http:\/\/wmbriggs.com\/post\/5118\/<br>www.sciencedaily.com\/releases\/2013\/<wbr>08\/130811005342.htm<br><br><br>TL;DR- liberals generally are liberal because they want to play the &quot;hero&quot; without doing any REAL work:<br>http:\/\/therightstuff.biz\/2014\/12\/31<wbr>\/liberalism-and-low-self-esteem\/","filename":"omdtiaXkvr1tw42c2o","ext":".jpg","w":853,"h":1280,"tn_w":83,"tn_h":125,"tim":1490713746202,"time":1490713746,"md5":"2pYRQUWG0eC9BSFZY8wbDA==","fsize":249093,"resto":118649875,"id":"XzjYIqc5","country":"AU","m_img":1,"country_name":"Australia"},{"no":118657563,"now":"03\/28\/17(Tue)11:10:21","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118657181\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118657181<\/a><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;virtue signalling intensifies<\/span>","filename":"libruls everyone 1","ext":".png","w":305,"h":167,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":68,"tim":1490713821496,"time":1490713821,"md5":"SM6XwBqCMmgJzee\/lYcnyA==","fsize":10762,"resto":118649875,"id":"XzjYIqc5","country":"AU","country_name":"Australia"},{"no":118657907,"now":"03\/28\/17(Tue)11:13:55","name":"Anonymous","filename":"hiercom","ext":".png","w":900,"h":1108,"tn_w":101,"tn_h":124,"tim":1490714035591,"time":1490714035,"md5":"pvuCy7sXR+Mb+n2mys7iFw==","fsize":429517,"resto":118649875,"id":"PQ4vRFvC","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":118658530,"now":"03\/28\/17(Tue)11:19:54","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118657907\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118657907<\/a>","filename":"oh wait you&#039;re serious let me laugh even harder","ext":".jpg","w":479,"h":344,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":89,"tim":1490714394179,"time":1490714394,"md5":"vtTNY5K+biuZ6oJxo7aRZg==","fsize":70498,"resto":118649875,"id":"XzjYIqc5","country":"AU","country_name":"Australia"},{"no":118658876,"now":"03\/28\/17(Tue)11:22:47","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118649875\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118649875<\/a><br>My county went red!

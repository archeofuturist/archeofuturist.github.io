You&#039;re essentially priced out of dating women with certain attitudes, but oh well, if someone is that demanding, a life spent with that person would be hell to begin with. If a man is expected to be the main financial contributor to a family, you can&#039;t bitch about women not dating you because you&#039;re broke. If you&#039;re broke, you shouldn&#039;t really be wasting money on frivolous dates either. For those of you who, like me, can get by on a day by just cooking cheap shit at home or eating a single big fast food meal and getting through the day on less than $10 worth of food, good fucking luck dating a woman. Not trying to sound like I&#039;m giving you guys shit or like I condone it as a morally righteous world, but it&#039;s realistic. With money comes opportunity and power, and that includes women. The problem with men is that a lot of non-broke dudes I know have no spine to defend their cash, they&#039;ll piss it away on frivolous relationships that crash and burn, zero balls in the relationship because they &quot;fell in love&quot; and can&#039;t say no. Sure, some of them and even myself have met that occasional low-maintenance woman, and sure, you can get by pretty cheap for a while, but an unsteady income will put stress on the relationship as it continues. I&#039;m not saying you have to buy her jewelry all the time, but if you can&#039;t at least semi-regularly go get a &quot;decent meal&quot;, the little fights and annoyances will all build up and things will go to shit.<br><br>That said, saying that character and confidence is an issue is straight-up bullshit, said by a woman too insecure with her wants and desires to admit that YES, money does matter.

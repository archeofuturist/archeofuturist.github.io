They actually blame Obama&#039;s administration for Assad&#039;s regime still standing! <br><br>Hold on, remember how the rank-and-file in the military practically revolted back in 2013 to stop an all-out assault on Assad? It was the right-wing that came out against this war, not the left. I thought Trump would reverse our retarded Syrian policy but he&#039;s actually doubling down on it. Does he really want to see a terrorist\/leftist victory against a national socialist government? <br><br>I think we got duped.

The left was calling for blood after the Arab spring started.

It had less to do with Christianity and more to do with the fact that the vast majority of southerners were Christians, so why not co-opt some christian symbols. The federal government was actively trying to destroy southern solidarity and culture after the civil war in order to prevent another from occuring. Partly to keep southern states poor, demoralized, and unorganized so they couldn&#039;t resist business interests in the north via legal game rigging via federal laws which is what started the civil war in the first place. It had nothing to do with evil white people hating niggers, chinks, spooks, gooks, or jews. That came much later. It had many black members because black people also had an interest in preserving southern culture and traditions. <br><br>I would say to Benson that he&#039;s a dumb cunt, and he should go fuck himself for being so fucking stupid. Islam has been, from day one, a military doctrine of conquest. With Muhammad setting himself up as a prophet in order to trick illiterate desert dwellers into following him and his made up bullshit. <br><br>Islam literally cannot coexist as economic, social, political, or military equals with any other doctrine. It is a pox that has blighted our world for far too long and there is nothing you can say or do to make Muslims stop chopping infidel heads off. Just look at Saudi Arabia. One of the most wealthy Islamic states in the middle east. And while the royals are living it up with golden toilets, the rest of the country is illiterate sand niggers herding sheep in the 21st century and chop people up for being faggots. That is the future you choose.

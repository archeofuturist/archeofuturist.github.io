Optimistic.<br><br>Guido is told Labour staffers spent today repeatedly asking their superiors for a key seats list of constituencies where resources should be targeted, only to be informed the list had yet to be decided. Regional managers have no idea on what resource basis they can plan. An astonishing lack of planning from the fans of centralised state planning given that a snap election has been a possibility that Corbyn and McDonnell had been warning of for months. Staff were also told that Labour has no election strapline slogan, and that the campaign budget had yet to be signed off. Sources say discussions took place throughout the day between McNicol and trade union bosses to try to secure funding, yet no budget guidance has been given. 50 days to go\u2026","filename":"1474848985659","ext":".jpg","w":227,"h":222,"tn_w":124,"tn_h":122,"tim":1492544624579,"time":1492544624,"md5":"xTA\/Q8vK+UqLrPQaR9fkSg==","fsize":34055,"resto":121722772,"id":"o8lSWfwO","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":121728969,"now":"04\/18\/17(Tue)15:44:19","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121728792\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121728792<\/a><br>His meme game is shite, the left will NEVER master meme politics","time":1492544659,"resto":121722772,"id":"M+6bVeXp","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":121728977,"now":"04\/18\/17(Tue)15:44:23","name":"Anonymous","com":"We are FUCKED.<br><br>I remain pro-Corbyn but people couldn&#039;t hate him any worse if there was HD footage of him sucking off Hitler, and there&#039;s not a shit in hell&#039;s chance that the Lib Dems swing in and save the day - tuition fees is too big and easy to grasp for them to shake it off by June.

Simply because the psychological shock when they will see in [the] future what the beautiful society of EQUALITY and social justice means in practice, obviously they will revolt. They will be very unhappy [and] frustrated people, and Marxist-Leninist regime does not tolerate these people. Obviously they will join the [ranks] of dissenters; dissidents. Unlike the present United States there will be no place for dissent in future Marxist-Leninist America. [Now] you can get popular like Daniel Elsburg and filthy rich like Jane Fonda for being a dissident [and] for criticizing your Pentagon. In [the] future these people will simply be [he makes a squishy noise] squashed like cockroaches for criticizing the government. Nobody is going to pay them nothing for their beautiful [and] noble ideas of EQUALITY.

Actually, it&#039;s over fulfilled because demoralization now reaches such areas where not even Comrade Andropov and all his experts would even dream of such tremendous success. Most of it is done by Americans to Americans thanks to lack of moral standards. For a brainwased person exposure to true information does not matter anymore. A person who was demoralized is unable to assess true information.

That&#039;s the tragedy of the situation of demoralization.<br><br>Useful idiots reap what they sow.","filename":"1490574815643","ext":".jpg","w":700,"h":476,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":170,"tim":1493243109367,"time":1493243109,"md5":"nC5u0wqWndeqqp6PosmsWw==","fsize":136619,"resto":0,"id":"Dmp3GCGr","country":"NO","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"braindead-libtards-will-defend-this","country_name":"Norway","replies":0,"images":0,"unique_ips":1}]}

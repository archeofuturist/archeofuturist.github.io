Moldbug had good content but his writing style was too obtuse to develop a large readership. That being said, he had the most reasonable (and secular) take on reactionary government that I&#039;ve seen come out of the movement. Religion is great for social control, but it&#039;s a design flaw to base your government around something so intellectually flimsy.","time":1492092162,"resto":120912283,"id":"fCFbej\/n","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":120913782,"now":"04\/13\/17(Thu)10:14:25","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120912650\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120912650<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;secular<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;good<\/span><br>Name one good thing that ever came from secularism.","time":1492092865,"resto":120912283,"id":"mM9i6GOn","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":120914552,"now":"04\/13\/17(Thu)10:21:42","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120913782\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120913782<\/a><br>Enlightenment Science, abortions, not throwing gay people off of buildings, the theory of evolution","time":1492093302,"resto":120912283,"id":"HF6nPqwx","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":120915027,"now":"04\/13\/17(Thu)10:26:34","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120914552\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120914552<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;name the reasons western civilization will fall in our lifetime<\/span>","time":1492093594,"resto":120912283,"id":"mM9i6GOn","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":120916096,"now":"04\/13\/17(Thu)10:36:55","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120915027\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120915027<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt; Killing gay people has anything at all to do with the downfall or preservation of society<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt; Fuck science and technology and sheeeit<\/span>","time":1492094215,"resto":120912283,"id":"HF6nPqwx","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":120916357,"now":"04\/13\/17(Thu)10:39:21","name":"Anonymous","com":"NRx is where true Rightists eventually go.

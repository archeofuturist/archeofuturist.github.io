There is more Israelite DNA in a modern day Palestinian. Whatever Israelite DNA modern day Jews have is minuscule.<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Jews were mainly Khazars, from Khazaria, a Caucasus country which is now called Kazakhstan, Georgia, and other names. The Khazarians converted from pagan religions to talmudic Judaism after the 8th century, but of course, racially they remain Khazars.<\/span><br>The Khazars were and are a genome that is mainly Turkish and Mongolian blood.<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Thus today, when you see a \u201cJew,\u201d what you are actually encountering is a Khazar who practices Judaism. The Khazar has no Israelite blood. His ancestors are not the Israelites of the Bible. They did not worship the God, Jehovah, but instead literally were a phallic cult. They worshipped Satan by means of the male penis idol. The Khazars were never in the land of Israel. They are not the seed of Abraham. They have no promise from God and are not God&#039;s &quot;chosen&quot;.

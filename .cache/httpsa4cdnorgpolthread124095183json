The basic tenant of insurance is the larger the pool of people who put money in, the cheaper it becomes. By mandating that people must buy insurance, you collectively make it cheaper or at least reduce the rise in premiums collectives.

This is especially dickish because as pointed out before, the way to keep insurance costs low is to pool as many people together. Yes, if you&#039;re in a pool with someone who has cancer, your costs will increase, but that also means if you get cancer, you won&#039;t see your premiums sky rocket because insurance companies can&#039;t just move you to the high risk pool. Now why is the high risk pool bad? Because it&#039;s defacto not having insurance because the premiums and deductibles would be so high, you wouldn&#039;t be able to use it. Furthermore, states can refuse to help subsidize the pools or give an amount so negligible, it won&#039;t help. <br><br>The other big thing this bill does destroy medicare and subsidies for the poor and gives that money to the rich. Also we don&#039;t even know how much this will cost government because the CBO wasn&#039;t allowed to score the bill, but last time it meant 20 million people would be thrown off insurance. I&#039;m sure because this bill pandered to the freedom caucus that number will rise at least a few million more if not more. <br><br><br>That&#039;s not even getting into the fact it guts medicad and hands the money to the rich.","time":1493937945,"resto":124095183,"id":"i4yYBSJM","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":124124215,"now":"05\/04\/17(Thu)18:48:38","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p124123838\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;124123838<\/a><br>Your logic is correct but your conclusions are not.<br><br>What do you mean by &quot;hands the money to the rich?&quot;","time":1493938118,"resto":124095183,"id":"LNup9Mst","country":"SE","country_name":"Sweden"},{"no":124124561,"now":"05\/04\/17(Thu)18:51:06","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p124123838\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;124123838<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;cbo wasn&#039;t allowed to score the bill<\/span><br>Doesn&#039;t mean anything because they just static score everything and it&#039;s always horribly wrong.

Not true at all.<\/span><br>More than 70% of all voters make more than 50k and Trump won that group by a few % while he lost the poorfag vote by 10%.<br>Do the math. <br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;I know more precise because I live in a red state, dummy. The Trump idiots here are either poor or barely middle class. They dont realize they&#039;re getting fucked over by Republicans.<\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;You fuck off, faggot.

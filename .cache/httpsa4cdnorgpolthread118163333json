Tenderloin is for numales, cucks, wankers, plonkas, dimwits, twits, twats, mongoloids and people who&#039;ve lost the plot in general. <br><br>It&#039;s also for women who choose to order it on dates for reasons other than the flavor of the steak. <br>1. The description &quot;petite&quot; fillet mignon makes them seem more dainty and feel better about themselves.<br>2. Very tender so their weak jaw muscles can fully masticate the meat<br>3. Smaller portion size allows them to eat less so they can be prepared to get plowed by the man who took them to a steakhouse and not be inconvenienced by shitting later in the night. <br><br>Well done steak and ketchup is definitely not a liberal food choice so don&#039;t even bring it up.","filename":"Johnkerrysuckscocksinhell","ext":".jpg","w":992,"h":744,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":187,"tim":1490404304037,"time":1490404304,"md5":"ArROQ5slhxg\/8jmyhk1BRg==","fsize":110565,"resto":0,"id":"kB5xA+E9","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"liberal-foods-also-things-only-liberals-eat-and","country_name":"United States","replies":0,"images":0,"unique_ips":1}]}

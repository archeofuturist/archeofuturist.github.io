I don&#039;t see how attacking Syria will help. It will just make them desperate and force Russia to bolster their air defenses as they take more drastic measures to keep control. <br><br>The U.S. has done several things after the attack. First, it sent envoy to threaten Syria openly at the UN. <br><br>Then Rex Tillerson says that there is no future for Assad in governing the Syrian people. <br><br>For whatever reason, this just shifted big. Who knows if Trump will continue to carry out this flash forged foreign policy toward Syria, but the results won&#039;t be fantastic either way. <br><br>I&#039;m thinking two possibilities. <br><br>First and most likely in my opinion, Trump is desperate for some kind of huge distraction to get people to stop calling him a Russian puppet. It&#039;s possible according to whitehouse statements that he thoroughly warned Russia (And therefore Syria) beforehand, which would allow them to minimize loss of life and hardware at this remote airbase. That way, it&#039;s no harm-no foul, and with a few harsh and very public statements, you get Americans and Russians alike thinking &quot;Holy shit I guess we&#039;re not cozying up to them after all&quot;. Thing is, both sides are making some pretty strong statements..<br><br>Second and less likely (But appearing more likely over time as this story progresses), someone finally got through to Trump and gave him conclusive evidence of members of his staff and elements of the Russian government working and planning to influence him behind his back for specific ends. If this happened, then it explains why he&#039;s distancing himself from Bannon (which seems not to have any particular explanation at this time). I feel that this is somewhat supported by the fact that at the same time Tomahawks were streaking across the night sky in Syria, Trump was sitting at a photo-op with the Chinese president. Could be a message that he intends to shift relations in retaliation for whatever he learned about Russias activities.","time":1491610084,"resto":120031050,"id":"taDea1YO","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":120051543,"now":"04\/07\/17(Fri)20:09:27","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120050811\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120050811<\/a><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt; Explain, which countries attacked the states recently?<\/span><br>Nope, you need adult literacy courses, because that is not the argument at hand.<br><br>It&#039;s countries OUT OF LINE.

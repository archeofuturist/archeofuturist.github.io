Trump signed a Proclamation honoring March 21, 2017, as National Agriculture Day.<br><br>NATIONAL AGRICULTURE DAY, 2017<br><br>- - - - - - -<br><br>BY THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA **<br><br>A PROCLAMATION<br><br>America&#039;s farmers and ranchers help feed the world, fuel our Nation&#039;s economy, and lead global markets in output and productivity. The efficiency of American agriculture has provided this country with abundance our ancestors could not have imagined.<br><br>The agriculture sector of the United States is endlessly innovative. It continuously builds on its centuries of progress through advances in science, research, technology, safety, production, and marketing to meet the demands of changing consumer needs and complex world markets. The agriculture sector provides jobs across our Nation, not just for farmers and ranchers, but for foresters, scientists, processors, shippers, firefighters, police, and retailers.<br><br>American agriculture is the largest positive contributor to our Nation&#039;s net trade balance, generating 10 percent of our exports and millions of American jobs. America&#039;s farmers and ranchers provide a safe and plentiful domestic food supply, which is vital to our national security. Moreover, they safeguard our sustainable resource base for future generations. As my Administration fights for better trade deals, agriculture will be an important consideration so that its significant contributions will only increase in the years ahead.<br><br>American farmers and ranchers are the heart and soul of America and they represent the determined, self-reliant character of our Nation.

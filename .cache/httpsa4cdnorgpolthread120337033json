There is good archaeological evidence for a great flood, for example, at the end of the last ice age (c.12,000BP).

Again, how can something that has a finite beginning be infinite?<br><br>Why do you reject the Trinity when the Modalistic Mormon view falls apart in scenes like the agony at Gethsemani, Jesus&#039; Baptism by John the Baptist, etc.? How can Jesus declared Himself to be I Am if He is not God, the Logos made flesh? If you stick Jesus in the &quot;created&quot; category and God in the &quot;infinite&quot; category (even though you can&#039;t because He was created too but let&#039;s play along here), how can a created creature atone and redeem other created creatures? The Mormon view of God and godhood is totally unfounded scripturally and historically. Nowhere in the earliest manuscripts of any Biblical text Old or New Testament, or any contemporary texts do you see anything approaching this notion. The earliest church leaders, the Church Fathers as they&#039;re called, were only a few generations removed at most from the Disciples, and this monumental doctrine was already lost that they speak nothing of it?

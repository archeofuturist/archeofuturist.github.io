Certainly not a right vs left type thing which seems to be growing. <br><br>Certainly we should all be aware that the stability of the environment is of extreme importance to the continuation of civilization. We should also be aware that for most of the earth&#039;s history a stable climate with reliable and predictable seasons has not always been the case. Which should make it seem all the more important. <br><br>But in various places, including here you will have people unironically try to say that humans are having no significant impact on the global environment, when it should be clear to anyone paying attention to the state of the world and the global population of humans that&#039;s that&#039;s impossible. <br><br>It seems like climate getting fucked in the ass by corporations would be something \/pol\/ is up in arms about.

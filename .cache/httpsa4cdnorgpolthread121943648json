Our teacher is a huge lib and even named one of her kids after FDR. To start off the chapter she says we are going to do an experiment. She has everyone push their desks to the sides of the class. <br>Lines every student up and she starts sending all the Black and Mexican kids to the back of the room<br>Hands out several Star of David cut outs and pins them on some random white people and sends them to the back of the room too<br>Just about 6 of us white kids left and all of them I know or are my friends<br>Says everyone in the back of the room would be slave labor or be systematically killed because of who they are and that the kids in the front of the room were the only ones privileged enough to exist in Nazi Germany<br>All the people that would be \u201cgassed\u201d are people that disrupt every class, fail every test, and complain about homework. Literally would be a dream way to get an education. That day is the day my teacher taught me that Hitler did nothing wrong.","filename":"the_thinker","ext":".jpg","w":459,"h":600,"tn_w":191,"tn_h":250,"tim":1492658116509,"time":1492658116,"md5":"BeSpRbPVZF\/d2YKWFR\/2hg==","fsize":50488,"resto":0,"id":"w5u\/+o1W","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"how-were-you-taught-about-ww2","country_name":"United States","replies":8,"images":0,"unique_ips":9},{"no":121943978,"now":"04\/19\/17(Wed)23:17:56","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121943648\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121943648<\/a><br>In high school we watched a movie about pearl harbor.

He lived in a richer area of New York at one point. I bumped into him in a sandwich shop. He was shooting the shit with the sandwich maker when I came up to give my order. I got a standard turkey on wheat with mayo and pepper jack. It was something very simple. All the while Donald was laughing to himself and pointing at me occasionally mumbling, &quot;Is this guy serious?&quot;<br><br>I wasn&#039;t sure why I guess he was displeased about me ordering or what I ordered. After I got my sandwich I sat down and ate while he just leaned back into the windowed meat display and watched me. When I got up to throw the trash away he stopped me and offered his hand. I was shy because I knew who he was but he introduced himself anyways. When I shook his hand the other hand came out of his pocket holding a tazer which he used on my neck. When I fell to the ground tense I soiled myself. He laughed, &quot;This guy.&quot; And started kicking me in the face quoting The Apprentice over and over, &quot;YOU&#039;RE FIRED, YOU&#039;RE FIRED.&quot;<br><br>I woke up in the hospital next to a vase of broccoli labeled, &quot;From Don.&quot;<br><br>Now every year he shows up to my families Thanksgiving dinner, uninvited, unannounced, and just eats, laughs to himself, and then leaves. Last year he murdered my mother. I fear what hurricane Donald will bring this year..","time":1490624047,"resto":118515962,"id":"PLatsDVM","country":"CA","country_name":"Canada"},{"no":118516228,"now":"03\/27\/17(Mon)10:15:09","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118515962\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118515962<\/a><br>Stay mad","filename":"farageenglishpepe","ext":".png","w":803,"h":724,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":112,"tim":1490624109819,"time":1490624109,"md5":"z9Qlh0z4Apx+khYDeYjSZw==","fsize":606485,"resto":118515962,"id":"POrUWNf2","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":118516836,"now":"03\/27\/17(Mon)10:22:42","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118515962\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118515962<\/a><br>Brumpf BTFO","time":1490624562,"resto":118515962,"id":"hPSqiWUl","country":"FR","country_name":"France"},{"no":118517083,"now":"03\/27\/17(Mon)10:25:21","name":"NOT SHARIABLUE","com":"It&#039;s over for trump, impeachment is few hours away #HEWILLNOTDIVIDEUS<br>#RESIST","time":1490624721,"resto":118515962,"id":"GzTSSpC\/","country":"IN","country_name":"India"}]}

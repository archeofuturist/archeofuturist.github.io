That&#039;s the main symptom of many governments, but the way socialism deals with it is by disenfranchising dissenters. The way free markets deal with dissent is to ignore them and continue operating, but notice, not disenfranchise them - they always have a chance to succeed in the system by becoming better than the competition, and that entails finding a market.","filename":"1488976203151","ext":".gif","w":800,"h":667,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":208,"tim":1493562369552,"time":1493562369,"md5":"m7DPtSpreCo2Mnx4n7VUWg==","fsize":1294489,"resto":0,"id":"ETxzTGp3","country":"AU","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"the-problem-with-socialism-is-that-as-soon-as-one","country_name":"Australia","replies":1,"images":0,"unique_ips":2},{"no":123484767,"now":"04\/30\/17(Sun)10:51:33","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123482432\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123482432<\/a><br>notice word &quot;fair&quot; also has a meaning about carnivals, amusement parks, etc.. So you have to be very careful when CIA homos, DIA cunts or all kinds of shit martini stirrers start chewing ears with linguistic and semantic weapons designed as double use technology. If you can&#039;t see through charade - you&#039;re as good as dead. To make matters worse - it&#039;s impossible to see through such bullshit. They are highly trained special forces. Think of acrobat balanced act in a fair walking thin line high above. If you try to follow - it will be your final steps.","time":1493563893,"resto":123482432,"id":"3Ala34e8","country":"LT","country_name":"Lithuania"}]}

Buying diamonds is one of the most bluepilled things you can possibly do. Diamonds have NO intrinsic value. They&#039;re just fucking rocks. The kikes in charge of the diamond mines are sitting on metric tons of them, but only leak out a few each year in order to artificially increase scarcity, and therefore prices. The value of diamonds is completely artificial. It&#039;s not like precious metals.","time":1492787447,"resto":122141814,"id":"p6qcx8d0","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":122145750,"now":"04\/21\/17(Fri)11:12:26","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122145578\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122145578<\/a><br>That&#039;s exactly my point<br><br>but <a href=\"#p122144809\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122144809<\/a> is implying that everyone on \/pol\/ is poor, which is retarded.","time":1492787546,"resto":122141814,"id":"H87qTIdP","country":"US","country_name":"United States"}]}

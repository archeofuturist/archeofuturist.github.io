Then there is the rustling noise of the curtain going up a very silent noise, but you can hear it. The stage is pitch black. A powerful spotlight stabs into the darkness. It reveals a live chicken crucified on a miniature cross. You hear the audience gasp almost in unison.<br><br>Then a young girl in leotards comes out, slashes the throat of the chicken, unties its wings and legs from the cross and lets it run around the stage with its blood spurting until it falls dead. The stage lights up. The girl takes off her leotards, and picks up a large doll. Howling and giggling, she twists the arms and legs off the doll. Then she lies down, naked, and a huge male comes out with a razor -and shaves the White girl&#039;s private parts. They get into a burlap bag and, standing up, engage in sexual intercourse. Finally, the girl emerges from the bag and her naked flesh is rubbed all over with wet spaghetti.<br><br>You have just been to a performance of the &quot;New Theatre,&quot; a &quot;happening&quot; <br><br>Not to be outdone by &quot;Whites,&quot; the Negro race is doing its share to create the same sort of &quot;New Theatre.&quot; TIME magazine reports that Le Roi Jones, the Negro &quot;playwright,&#039; puts on a play appropriately called &quot;The Toilet.&quot; As the curtain goes up, we see a White boy being held with his head in a urinal by a Negro, while other Negroes actually urinate on the White boy on stage.<br><br>According to Le Roi&#039;s play, the White boy has been trying to get the Negroes to engage in homosexual acts with him, and the Negroes are chastising him by beating him up, stuffing his head in the urinal and actually urinating on his face.<br><br>Not only is this play actually staged, without public protest, but U.S. tax payers subsidized this degeneracy with $40,000 in federal funds; (U.

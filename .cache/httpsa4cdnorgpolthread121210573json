Pierre Trudeau sold Canada out. He wrote multiple pro-communism papers and respected and complimented Mao, Stalin, Castro, etc. He sold Canada&#039;s national bank to jews in exchange for funding for the Trudeau foundation and guarantee his son is elected in the future. He has implemented pro-immigration and anti-white multiculturalism bullshit from the day he went into office. These immigrants are bought and paid for by white taxes and are imported votes for the liberal. All immigrants vote left. Always. They have since then fostered and promoted THEIR culture in media, events and funding. They actively suppress the national culture of our country and people and are doing everything to destroy any nationlistic pride. When everything is reduced to individualism, the government in control gains power. There can be no political movements or wellspring of change if your national identity is destroyed and immigrants litter your neighbourhoods and dominate your news even when they are a visible minority. <br><br>You have the cowboy culture in the prairies with rodeos and football and country music. You have celtic roots in the maritimes with gaelic heritage with pubs and fiddlers and music reflective of it. We have a diverse culture unique to various regions due to our size - that doesnt mean we have no culture. All we are bombarded with is the garbage GTA bullshit where they import their immigrants to. Trudeau and his entire family are traitors to Canada that need to be excised. The entire government is overrun with Muslim Brotherhood and Jewish agents furthering their own agendas.

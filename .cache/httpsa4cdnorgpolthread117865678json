I also am attractive and very fit naturally but also work out 6 times per week on top of that and only eat only the very best. As a result of being very well connected with large circles of friends and being a god facially and bodily wise i also always have gfs, fuckbuddies, and am always hooking up with girls at parties and that i meet at bars. Not to mention all the girls sliding into my DMs. With my connections and high intellect i also managed to get a job after graduating from princetin university making 250k a year. So in my case my intellect has helped me socially and in life, or i guess you could say my social skills have aided my intellectual development, or they are mutually exclusive and are just naturally there. But i dont want to get to deep and confuse anyone here. I know that i am blessed to get where i am but it also took some work to become both a brainiac and a socially and financially successful fuckmonster.

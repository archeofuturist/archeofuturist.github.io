I also am attractive and very fit naturally but also work out 6 times per week on top of that and only eat only the very best. As a result of being very well connected with large circles of friends and being a god facially and bodily wise i also always have gfs, fuckbuddies, and am always hooking up with girls at parties and that i meet at bars. Not to mention all the girls sliding into my DMs. With my connections and high intellect i also managed to get a job after graduating from princetin university making 250k a year. So in my case my intellect has helped me socially and in life, or i guess you could say my social skills have aided my intellectual development, or they are mutually exclusive and are just naturally there. But i dont want to get to deep and confuse anyone here. I know that i am blessed to get where i am but it also took some work to become both a brainiac and a socially and financially successful fuckmonster.

In 1852, with the support of Horace Mann, another strong advocate of the Prussian model, Everett made the decision to adopt the Prussian system of education in Massachusetts. Unfortunately for the children and poor Irish Catholics of Massachusetts and elsewhere, the system produced a willing, cheap labor force with minimal reading and numbers skills. The Everetts of the world understood that people who could read and understand are dangerous because they are intellectually equipped to find out things for themselves, thus becoming a threat to already established power elites.&quot;<br><br>https:\/\/<br>hybridrogue1.wordpress.com\/2015\/04\/<wbr>26\/compulsory-schooling-indoctrinat<wbr>ion\/<br><br>Inglis, for whom a lecture in education at Harvard is named, makes it perfectly clear that compulsory schooling on this continent was intended to be just what it had been for Prussia in the 1820s: a fifth column into the burgeoning democratic movement that threatened to give the peasants and the proletarians a voice at the bargaining table. Modern, industrialized, compulsory schooling was to make a sort of surgical incision into the prospective unity of these underclasses. Divide children by subject, by age-grading, by constant rankings on tests, and by many other more subtle means, and it was unlikely that the ignorant mass of mankind, separated in childhood, would ever reintegrate into a dangerous whole.","filename":"AyyLmao6","ext":".jpg","w":1114,"h":620,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":69,"tim":1490238856964,"time":1490238856,"md5":"H3uXZWArGPAwWiP9mWIyDw==","fsize":569392,"resto":117865678,"id":"6rY\/PM\/r","country":"US","m_img":1,"country_name":"United States"},{"no":117878559,"now":"03\/22\/17(Wed)23:14:43","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p117878497\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;117878497<\/a><br>https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=eeE<wbr>WPbTad_Q","time":1490238883,"resto":117865678,"id":"6rY\/PM\/r","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":117880886,"now":"03\/22\/17(Wed)23:35:02","name":"Anonymous","com":"bump","filename":"WalkingDeadBrazil 4chNoSound","ext":".webm","w":352,"h":640,"tn_w":68,"tn_h":125,"tim":1490240102272,"time":1490240102,"md5":"b8LArfgOXVCnWWeeYrbK+g==","fsize":2358388,"resto":117865678,"id":"6rY\/PM\/r","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":117882042,"now":"03\/22\/17(Wed)23:44:53","name":"Anonymous","com":"I was depressed during High School and I was brought to a therapist.<br><br>He said I had no friends and I did not believe him, but years later I realized it was true.

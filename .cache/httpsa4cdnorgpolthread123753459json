You will not be able to make heads or tails of 4chan. Furthermore, if you are stupid enough to post there you will be insulted in ways you never imagined possible. I don\u2019t care how calm and collected you are, if the Dali Lama himself posted on 4chan they would have him in a fit of rage within five minutes. And God help you if you try to insult them back. 4chan will hack every social media account you have, they will hack your phone, they will hack your PC, they will find the most embarrassing thing you were ever dumb enough to put in digital form and they will send it to your boss and your mom. Only then will they call 911 and have the SWAT team kick down your door. I am not exaggerating in the slightest; you will end up looking down the barrel of a cop\u2019s assault rifle. Don\u2019t believe me? Google \u201cswatting\u201d. Normies should never ever ever go to 4chan. You have been warned.<br><br><br>HAHAHAHAHAHAH WINNING","filename":"QW","ext":".jpg","w":599,"h":449,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":187,"tim":1493720648778,"time":1493720648,"md5":"vpzaczeG+QOnZIkV0jrm+A==","fsize":37096,"resto":0,"id":"3WYQus2M","country":"GB","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"do-not-i-repeat-do-not-go-to-4chan","country_name":"United Kingdom","replies":1,"images":0,"unique_ips":2},{"no":123755544,"now":"05\/02\/17(Tue)06:55:08","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123753459\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123753459<\/a><br>Plebbit?","time":1493722508,"resto":123753459,"id":"8BAaPb3T","country":"NZ","country_name":"New Zealand"}]}

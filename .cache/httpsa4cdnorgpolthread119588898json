I have seen it myself at lower-tier state schools and CCs I&#039;ve taught for. If you, as a prof, fail LaTonka then you are jeopardizing your tenure or future classes as an adjunct. It is easier to just bite the bullet and pass them with a B and move on with your life. You will only lose if you try to hold them to the same standard or enforce university policy fairly (in rare circumstances things like cheating and plagiarism are enforced with protected class students, but this is not the usual course of action in American schools). Imagine all that but with the added pressure that the admission folks and the faculty see themselves as warriors for the soul of humanity and must admit and support all non-white males as a matter of moral decency. <br><br>Ive personally seen this happen and have had discussions with moderate (not even liberal) colleagues who fear failing a student because of the repercussions. One department pressured profs to be lenient to muslim students. How are muslims a historically oppressed minority in this country?!?! Heck, Ive even seen it with campu parking violations (I was on the parking appeals panel for a year). If a student said they got a ticket because they were black, the ticket was dismissed. No one argued against it because you would be labeled a racist. <br><br>Yeah, so the SJW has us by the ball sack and until accusations of racism won&#039;t ruin your career, there is little you can do to fight against it.

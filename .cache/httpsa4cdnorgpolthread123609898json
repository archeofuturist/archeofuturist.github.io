The fossil records doesn&#039;t prove it. Most transitional fossils and intermediate forms were shown to be forgeries (and some are still in present evolution books) others are massive extrapolations (determining the entire body of animal based off a small piece of jaw bone). Most evolutionists disagree on certain features of evolution (see the Altenberg 16). Academia is unreliable and peer-review is all about enforcing group think. Evolution is the foundation for atheism and as Dawkins said if it evolution made it possible to be an intellectually fulfilled atheist. It is thus inherently socialistic, in that socialists\/Marxists believe in shaping man through statism and big government (much like fascists) since we are determined by our environment we can be changed by our environment. <br><br>There is also the fact that all evidence of evolution is bacteria where certain mutations turn off certain bodily functions. There isn&#039;t any evidence that mutations add genetic information. This is what underpins evolution. In fact the human genome is shrinking as evidenced by Dr Jon Sanford (inventor of the gene gun and former atheist).","time":1493638962,"resto":123609898,"id":"QLhJB3iR","country":"AU","country_name":"Australia"},{"no":123610734,"now":"05\/01\/17(Mon)07:46:17","name":"Anonymous","com":"<span class=\"quote\">&gt;evolution<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;religious dogma <\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;ATHEIST religious dogma <\/span><br>What the fuck are you on anon","time":1493639177,"resto":123609898,"id":"ydzkv3Yj","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":123610742,"now":"05\/01\/17(Mon)07:46:22","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123609898\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123609898<\/a><br>They do<br>It&#039;s the answer to how","time":1493639182,"resto":123609898,"id":"KA75+dUl","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":123610787,"now":"05\/01\/17(Mon)07:46:48","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123610202\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123610202<\/a><br>Common descent is challenged even by modern evolutionist<br><br>https:\/\/www.evolutionnews.org\/?s=co<wbr>mmon+descent<br><br>Just goes to show atheism is a just fallen man&#039;s attempt to give themselves license to sin","time":1493639208,"resto":123609898,"id":"QLhJB3iR","country":"AU","country_name":"Australia"},{"no":123610860,"now":"05\/01\/17(Mon)07:47:31","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123610734\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123610734<\/a><br>Forgot to reply<br><a href=\"#p123610415\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123610415<\/a>","time":1493639251,"resto":123609898,"id":"ydzkv3Yj","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":123610970,"now":"05\/01\/17(Mon)07:48:31","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123610734\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123610734<\/a><br>Typical atheist response. <br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt; WHAT THE FUCK ARE <\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt; ARE YOU FUCKING<\/span><br>The foul language isn&#039;t an argument.

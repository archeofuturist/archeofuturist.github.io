It ignores way too many power dynamics, settings, and why each of these things occur. The problem is that you have people in BLM and other organizations that believe the crime stats are lying to us when it comes to how much crime is being committed by Black Americans compared to other groups. They legitimately believe that white people rape, murder, and assault at the exact same rates as whites, but its just the &#039;racist system&#039; that catches them more. That may be true for petty crimes (like drug possession), but to think that police are missing thousands of bodies murdered by white civilians every year compared to blacks?

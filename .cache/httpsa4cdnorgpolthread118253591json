And maybe you start to question if WW2 was the right course of history, if Hitler truly wanted war, like Pat Buchanan, or if there really is something going on with a certain tribe. The normie will never take the red pill, because his world would crumble and the order of society he lives in. Layer upon layer of society has been built on lies. And therefor it is only ever going to fundamentally change, if the whole system collapses.

A man who was most definetely not a Nazi and beloved by a Jewess. Karl-Fried Graf D\u00fcrkheim, who worked as an ambassador\/agent for Ribbentrop at the time. It&#039;s a long conversation, but it boils down to two sentences. D\u00fcrkheim asked his Anglo counterpart: &quot;Why are you so afraid? Why are you are so erratic, because of a small country like Poland?&quot; And he replied: &quot;It is not about Poland. Churchill had me tell you: If I was at Hitler&#039;s position, I&#039;d know what I&#039;d do: conquer all of Europe!&quot; And that is why the war happened.<br><br>France, GB and Germany never managed to unite their forces in 1,000 years and neutralized each other. That is why we lost the world leadership to the USA and will probably lose it to the Chinese. And it already goes back to Karl the great who divided the Frankish empire, so both parts, France and the later Holy Roman Empire were each too weak to unite Europe under their banner. And so were Napoleon and Hitler.

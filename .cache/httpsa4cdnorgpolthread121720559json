That fact is supported by theology, history and science. When Jesus was in Judea, it was not the &quot;homeland&quot; of the ancestors of those who today style themselves &quot;Jews&quot;. Their ancestors never set a foot in Judea. They existed at that time in Asia, their &quot;homeland&quot;, and were known as Khazars. In none of the manuscripts of the original Old or New Testament was Jesus described or referred to as a &quot;Jew&quot;.

The religious sect in Judea, in the time of Jesus, to which self-styled &quot;Jews&quot; today refer to as &quot;Jews&quot;, were known as &quot;Pharisees&quot;. &quot;Judaism&quot; today and &quot;Pharisaism&quot; in the time of Jesus are the same.<br><br>Jesus abhorred and denounced &quot;Pharisaism&quot;; hence the words, &quot;Woe unto you Scribes and Pharisees, Hypocrites, Ye Serpents, Ye Generation of Vipers&quot;.","time":1492546220,"resto":121720559,"id":"oDASxt1C","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":121732795,"now":"04\/18\/17(Tue)16:12:40","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121731980\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121731980<\/a><br>You still aren&#039;t addressing the elephant in the room.

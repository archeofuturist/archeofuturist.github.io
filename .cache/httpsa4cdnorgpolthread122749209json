People are just more comfortable going about their lives while listening to corporate-driven news then potentially being upset by something they might not agree with.<br><br>FFS I saw the thread on Reddit where they were talking about how Chobani was suing Alex Jones and someone unironically used the fact that the 60 Minutes segment about Chobani made them think better of the company without realizing that they watched an hour-long chobani advertisement. At least when Alex Jones starts to shill things he out right tells you. Most corporate news programs just intersperse it with their commentary and hope you don&#039;t realize it. They also push an extreme political agenda and as we saw during the election season are more than willing to sell out their audience for political purposes.<br><br>Honestly, if the media weren&#039;t so obviously biased and such corporate whores people like Alex Jones wouldn&#039;t exist.","filename":"1481070116027","ext":".jpg","w":495,"h":495,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":125,"tim":1493137311809,"time":1493137311,"md5":"flnLSR6gfEk3+7+3klf3eA==","fsize":156250,"resto":122749209,"id":"wTyZg6a3","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":122751283,"now":"04\/25\/17(Tue)12:22:05","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122750799\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122750799<\/a><br>See<br><a href=\"#p122750044\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122750044<\/a><br><br>Go prep the bull.","filename":"1479702363291","ext":".jpg","w":2048,"h":1365,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":83,"tim":1493137325348,"time":1493137325,"md5":"yTsnN34OP+RdKQ5K3qNkdw==","fsize":322725,"resto":122749209,"id":"+aY5MH91","country":"US","m_img":1,"country_name":"United States"},{"no":122751351,"now":"04\/25\/17(Tue)12:22:43","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122749209\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122749209<\/a><br>He&#039;s controlled opposition.<br>He&#039;s there to act like he&#039;s &quot;woke af&quot; and confuse the masses into thinking he&#039;s crazy and associate this with the things he talk about.","time":1493137363,"resto":122749209,"id":"7sU3wrzx","country":"CA","country_name":"Canada"},{"no":122751356,"now":"04\/25\/17(Tue)12:22:46","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122749209\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122749209<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;implying sweden isn&#039;t a joke country<\/span>","time":1493137366,"resto":122749209,"id":"HK7IFNpK","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":122751357,"now":"04\/25\/17(Tue)12:22:46","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122751283\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122751283<\/a><br>This.","time":1493137366,"resto":122749209,"id":"+mlZuFx+","country":"NL","country_name":"Netherlands"},{"no":122751421,"now":"04\/25\/17(Tue)12:23:24","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122749726\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122749726<\/a><br>Yes Indians and Pakis are anglos i see.<br>Nothing new under the sun.","time":1493137404,"resto":122749209,"id":"\/NMJ\/C1P","country":"SE","country_name":"Sweden"},{"no":122751619,"now":"04\/25\/17(Tue)12:25:10","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122750275\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122750275<\/a><br><a href=\"#p122750332\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122750332<\/a><br><a href=\"#p122750393\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122750393<\/a><br>Say what you want.

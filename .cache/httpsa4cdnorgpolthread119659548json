I understand that there&#039;s commonly a distinction made between the concentration and extermination camps, but really when you think about it that just doesn&#039;t make any sense. Why would Jews taken from certain areas be killed, while others sent to work?<br><br>And you can say &#039;oh well the ones that weren&#039;t fit to work, they were sent to the extermination camps!&#039; but that doesn&#039;t really hold up once you look at the Diary of Anne Frank, a very young girl, not suited for work to start with, who was left alive even after contracting typhus.<br><br>Combine this with the fact that all extermination camps were the ones left to Soviet occupation and you bring in the Soviets&#039; reputation for propaganda and misleading information. Then you bring up the question, well if the Nazis wanted to kill the Jews, why did they wait until the start of the war to do it? A more sensical question is, why would the nazis wait until the start of the war to \/enslave\/ them? Well to help the war effort of course.<br><br>Is it possible a shitload still died? Yeah. Did the Nazis hate the Jews? Yeah sure. But there&#039;s definitely a lot of shady shit surrounding the whole thing.<br><br><a href=\"#p119669008\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119669008<\/a><br>Well a lot of them are dead, my dude. But that 6 million difference is in Europe alone, and old articles from a Jewish news service reporting on emigration at the time claimed literal millions moving into the soviet union as the Nazi occupation spread. If you REALLY want I can post them. So it&#039;s entirely possible a lot of them emigrated before, during and after the war.<br><br>Hence, my conclusion that the number is most likely somewhere in between.

There is no cold war with fucking Russia. <br><br><br>Putin is just a successful troll. The entire cold war with the West is a PR farce for Russian bydlo, Western journalists and deeply concerned liberals and schizophrenics who browse \/pol\/ and zero-hedge waiting for a nuclear war happening or someshit. <br><br>Putin&#039;s entire agenda and plan is to troll the West with PR while attending journo conference and meetings giving knowing smiles and winks. He has no intention of confronting the West, his entire economy is dependant on the West and Russia has no power to confront the West. The confrontation is about PR, schendenfraude from both sides and some retarded cockhole problems that nobody gives a fuck about. <br><br>Likewise the West has no intention of overthrowing Putin or collapsing Russia. It&#039;s not an economic competitor, not a military competitor nor an ideological alternative. There are no opposition forces in Russia who are capable of overthrowing Putin, there is an absolutely mentally retarded and autistic liberal democratic minority on Echo Moscow, Dozhd TV, and Novaya Gazetta that is not a political force but a force of autistic screechers .","filename":"456","ext":".jpg","w":1180,"h":842,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":178,"tim":1490192831851,"time":1490192831,"md5":"JSbVlsvAEr7RvbEdlnI3aA==","fsize":518586,"resto":0,"id":"TqAvJZE8","country":"CA","m_img":1,"bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"the-cold-war-with-russia-is-not-real","country_name":"Canada","replies":2,"images":0,"unique_ips":1},{"no":117763928,"now":"03\/22\/17(Wed)10:27:44","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p117763861\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;117763861<\/a><br><br>To overthrow a regime the West usually uses the military. The West would be retarded to even consider such an operation in Russia a military coup in a nuclear armed state with 8000 warheads is completely out of the question imagine Turkish shit happening in Russia the West would lose it&#039;s collective shit. Also collapsing Russia would be a geo-political clusterfuck on the Eurasian landmass with global implications that would at best result in everything East of the Europe going under Chinese control resources oil and all which the West will never allow since Russia at least is a troll country that is kinda Western while China is a long term serious threat with 1.5 billion people. Putin is a threat to Ukraine and to the Baltic States and Poland who think he&#039;s a madman Hitler and in response to this threat NATO deployed like three additional brigade size forces in Eastern Europe which is fucking nothing. <br><br>. The West doesn&#039;t care at all about Ukraine. There is no Marshall plan for Ukraine. There is no plans to ally Ukraine. The IMF gives them a pathetic amount of money with outrageous conditions out of principles. Russia is still their main investor and trade partner. Russian influence didn&#039;t even decrease in Ukraine. Putin made a disastrous mistake invading Crimea and Donbass. Clearly if he just left them alone the entire Ukrainian agenda of EU integration would have collapsed in a year or so. The West gives no fucks about Ukraine at all. There are EU countries like Italy, France (if the right wins) Hungary Bulgaria, Spain Holland etc who are lobbying to end the sanctions on Russia. This should tell you all you need to know about the value Ukraine has to the West, their territory got annexed they got their shit kicked in Russia violated all international laws and norms and half of Europe is willing to let them get away with it while Trump doesn&#039;t even know where Ukraine is on the map he wants Russian neutrality when it comes to China and Iran.","time":1490192864,"resto":117763861,"id":"TqAvJZE8","country":"CA","country_name":"Canada"},{"no":117764170,"now":"03\/22\/17(Wed)10:29:34","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p117763928\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;117763928<\/a><br>China is a real threat, Iran with 80 million people and a rapidly growing population compared to 7 million in Israel and 20 million in Saudi Arabia is a real threat.

Both sides will never seriously consider doing anything ever. <br><br>Nobody knows why Putin invaded Crimea, they have a new military port built in Novorossyisk they don&#039;t even need Crimea to house their shitty fleet. It was probably due to Putin&#039;s personal ego, Gazprom Blue\/Turk stream pipeline costs and PR value. He could rule his shitty authoritarian state peacefully with no problems like Lukashenko and the bydlo would put up with it forever but he feels the need to entertain the bydlo with a PR war fought by General RT, Sputnik and Channel one and the bydlo eat that shit up disregarding all the corruption, the absolute lack of political or civil life and the apathy of their pathetic lives. Russia has a 1000 year tradition of authoritarian czarist rule the people are mentally accustomed to it and are fine with it except for a minority that always existed even during the time of the czars","time":1490192974,"resto":117763861,"id":"TqAvJZE8","country":"CA","country_name":"Canada"}]}

Why can&#039;t they have their economic ideas, but still keep the respect for the culture? Why do socialist ideas, and hatred of one&#039;s own nation, always seem to go together?

Any natural resource which is inherently limited in supply can generate economic rent, but the classical and most significant example of &#039;land monopoly&#039; involves the extraction of common ground rent from valuable urban locations. Georgists argue that taxing economic rent is efficient, fair, and equitable. The main Georgist policy is a tax assessed on land value. Georgists argue that revenues from a land value tax (LVT) can reduce or eliminate existing taxes on labor and investment that are unfair and inefficient. Some Georgists also advocate for the return of surplus public revenue back to the people by means of a basic income or citizen&#039;s dividend.","filename":"AnarchismTree09","ext":".gif","w":586,"h":378,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":80,"tim":1490801309004,"time":1490801309,"md5":"7QPD8RGPI7DZoPFc+kgttQ==","fsize":37377,"resto":118793798,"id":"k6ZwG071","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":118796742,"now":"03\/29\/17(Wed)11:30:19","name":"Anonymous","com":"We are libertarians who make the classical liberal distinction between land, labor and capital.

I may not agree with them, but I understand them.<br><br>Here is what I do NOT get: why is it that people with socialist views, always seemed obsessed with destroying and undermining the dominant culture? Why does it seem like they always have a problem with the society&#039;s traditions, holidays, pasttimes and dominant ethnic groups? Why can&#039;t they have their economic ideas, but still keep the respect for the culture? Why do socialist ideas, and hatred of one&#039;s own nation, always seem to go together? Does anyone have any insight to this?","filename":"1490795815073","ext":".jpg","w":1920,"h":1200,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":156,"tim":1490799543775,"time":1490799543,"md5":"0vAniTwnFGTvh6IC2BWlKA==","fsize":371987,"resto":0,"id":"j6fyJtG1","country":"US","m_img":1,"bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"i-understand-the-economic-arguments-that","country_name":"United States","replies":5,"images":3,"unique_ips":3},{"no":118795157,"now":"03\/29\/17(Wed)11:13:30","name":"Anonymous","com":"bump","time":1490800410,"resto":118793798,"id":"j6fyJtG1","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":118796087,"now":"03\/29\/17(Wed)11:23:35","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118793798\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118793798<\/a><br>You should check out Georgism. <br><br>Its sort of an American socialist system that doesn&#039;t seek to burn down any traditions and is opposed to Marxism<br><br>In fact its founder Henery George once described Marx as the &quot;prince of the muddleheads&quot;.

Any natural resource which is inherently limited in supply can generate economic rent, but the classical and most significant example of &#039;land monopoly&#039; involves the extraction of common ground rent from valuable urban locations. Georgists argue that taxing economic rent is efficient, fair, and equitable. The main Georgist policy is a tax assessed on land value. Georgists argue that revenues from a land value tax (LVT) can reduce or eliminate existing taxes on labor and investment that are unfair and inefficient. Some Georgists also advocate for the return of surplus public revenue back to the people by means of a basic income or citizen&#039;s dividend.","filename":"AnarchismTree09","ext":".gif","w":586,"h":378,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":80,"tim":1490801309004,"time":1490801309,"md5":"7QPD8RGPI7DZoPFc+kgttQ==","fsize":37377,"resto":118793798,"id":"k6ZwG071","country":"US","country_name":"United States"}]}

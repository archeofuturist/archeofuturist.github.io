I am all for killing dogs that show signs of human aggression or even dog aggression if you have to adopt them out. Any breed that shows signs of being abused far too much should be considered for death and not retraining. The dog community and infrastructure can&#039;t handle the amount of rescue dogs as is and the amount of Pit&#039;s that actually live past the ripe age of 1 is absurdly low. Even if you bred a dog for the length of it&#039;s life and has 10 pups every time, the odds that 1 of them will live is not likely. There are far too many &quot;Bleeding heart&quot; female rescue people who don&#039;t have the skill, but want to help the most hurt dogs. They lie to people and tell them they are fine but really are loaded guns. The amount of resources it takes to make a dog non-reactive to something it already reacts to isn&#039;t worth the time. For the same time and expertise\/money it takes, you can adopt out hundreds of perfectly ok dogs that will die anyways.<br><br>I&#039;ve done pitbull rescue for 5 years, own one..

They WERE used for bull baiting, then dog fighting. Something important to keep in mind is, they were bred for devotion to their master. Since people had to be in the pit with them (3 people), when they showed signs of human aggression they were immediately culled. It&#039;s NOT a breed characteristic to be any form of agressive towards people. I&#039;ve not seen a single person suffer from owning one during many years of working with animals (besides rescuing). I&#039;ve been bit by many dogs and I&#039;ve seen many dogs fight, none of which have been a Pitbull. The amount of abuse they take from children is god-like, no human would ever put up with them and enjoy it like they do. They have the most human like sense of being compared to other breeds, the way they express themselves is practically a double of their owner. The amount of abuse they can sustain before turning human aggressive far surpasses ANY BREED. People can set them on fire and they will recover and live a happy life with out faults..<br><br>The Michael Vick dogs are a perfect example of the abuse they can take before turning agro. Fought and trained, most of them when taken out of the fighting ring went on to become therapy dogs and best friends to people and other dogs.<br><br>When you get a owner devoted into making you a horrible dog.. When you are the most abused breed of dog, with only 1 &amp; 550 of them living for over a year.. When you want to do what ever makes your owner happy...

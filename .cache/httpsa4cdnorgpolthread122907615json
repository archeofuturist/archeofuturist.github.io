Evolutionary models of animal conflict predict that actors with greater fighting ability will more actively attempt to acquire or defend resources than less formidable contestants will. Here, we applied these models to political decision making about redistribution of income and wealth among modern humans. In studies conducted in Argentina, Denmark, and the United States, men with greater upper-body strength more strongly endorsed the self-beneficial position: Among men of lower socioeconomic status (SES), strength predicted increased support for redistribution; among men of higher SES, strength predicted increased opposition to redistribution. Because personal upper-body strength is irrelevant to payoffs from economic policies in modern mass democracies, the continuing role of strength suggests that modern political decision making is shaped by an evolved psychology designed for small-scale groups.<\/span>","time":1493229613,"resto":122907615,"id":"ew5sw1LO","country":"IL","country_name":"Israel"},{"no":122914281,"now":"04\/26\/17(Wed)14:01:20","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122908687\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122908687<\/a><br>This triggers the lefties here.","filename":"1482262631017","ext":".png","w":641,"h":640,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":124,"tim":1493229680346,"time":1493229680,"md5":"0l7t8fj52TuK9dZZN1gy2A==","fsize":232361,"resto":122907615,"id":"4+5gR5ej","country":"CA","country_name":"Canada"},{"no":122914391,"now":"04\/26\/17(Wed)14:02:08","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122910057\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122910057<\/a><br>This sums up Reddit pretty fucking well","time":1493229728,"resto":122907615,"id":"is6SZD1N","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":122914916,"now":"04\/26\/17(Wed)14:05:37","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122907615\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122907615<\/a><br>yes","time":1493229937,"resto":122907615,"id":"gaawi1my","country":"IT","country_name":"Italy"},{"no":122915198,"now":"04\/26\/17(Wed)14:07:34","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122912448\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122912448<\/a><br>definitely fat fucks but there are very few numale body types on the right, i mean statistically probably somewhere around 1-2% at most, whereas on the left it&#039;s like 25% or more","time":1493230054,"resto":122907615,"id":"i\/6e5gpH","country":"CA","country_name":"Canada"},{"no":122915244,"now":"04\/26\/17(Wed)14:07:53","name":"Anonymous","com":"I don&#039;t know man, I am a bodybuilder and I just don&#039;t care about either side or their troubles.

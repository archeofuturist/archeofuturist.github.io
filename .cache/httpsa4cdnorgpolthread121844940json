New legislation merged the Crown and the old East India Company courts and introduced a new penal code as well as new codes of civil and criminal procedure, based largely on English law. In the 1860s\u20131880s the Raj set up compulsory registration of births, deaths, and marriages, as well as adoptions, property deeds, and wills. The goal was to create a stable, usable public record and verifiable identities. However, there was opposition from both Muslim and Hindu elements who complained that the new procedures for census-taking and registration threatened to uncover female privacy. Purdah rules prohibited women from saying their husband&#039;s name or having their photograph taken. An all-India census was conducted between 1868 and 1871, often using total numbers of females in a household rather than individual names. Select groups which the Raj reformers wanted to monitor statistically included those reputed to practice female infanticide, prostitutes, lepers, and eunuchs.<\/span>","time":1492611903,"resto":121844940,"id":"RXORmQxL","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":121849176,"now":"04\/19\/17(Wed)10:27:19","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121844940\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121844940<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;There is no sound of flushing water in the villages, only an eternity of squatting and shitting in the streets and the laughter of their animal gods<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;and the laughter of their animal gods<\/span><br><br>maximum laff","filename":"1486409794057","ext":".png","w":720,"h":582,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":101,"tim":1492612039877,"time":1492612039,"md5":"wJWekZwknzbrN2x+4d1jnA==","fsize":183129,"resto":121844940,"id":"sOojc8+2","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":121849190,"now":"04\/19\/17(Wed)10:27:26","name":"Anonymous","filename":"indian mansion","ext":".jpg","w":366,"h":409,"tn_w":111,"tn_h":125,"tim":1492612046310,"time":1492612046,"md5":"a94zO0Ighh\/C8I5SIOXMgA==","fsize":65103,"resto":121844940,"id":"Xjznx6zy","country":"CA","country_name":"Canada"},{"no":121849204,"now":"04\/19\/17(Wed)10:27:36","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121848957\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121848957<\/a><br><br>He&#039;s not saying that&#039;s a Bad Thing, he&#039;s saying he&#039;s upset it wasn&#039;t Japan who would have appreciated being raped and looted so much more","filename":"maximum-belgium","ext":".jpg","w":1373,"h":1739,"tn_w":98,"tn_h":124,"tim":1492612056318,"time":1492612056,"md5":"Q3wPEh7iwvq56AQlaZ7dLw==","fsize":217268,"resto":121844940,"id":"GlrUxGab","country":"GB","m_img":1,"country_name":"United Kingdom"}]}

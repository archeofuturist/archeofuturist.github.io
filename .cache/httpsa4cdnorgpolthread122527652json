Wouldn&#039;t it be funny if it got out that Macron had engaged, or tried to engage in improper conduct with the young (arguably) hot daughter of his strong semi-senile wife in the past - that his wife is a woman scorned, but hush money from (((the establishment))) was doused on the matter to keep it a secret. (that last part about the hush money might be a stretch, but hey)<br><br> There have already been allegations about Macron being a closeted homosexual so the idea that he is a sexual pervert is already planted in the peoples&#039; heads...people might buy it and that would taint him into oblivion.<br><br>Well what do I know anons, I&#039;m just a Swedecuck grasping for straws here but something must be done in these coming two weeks and this is the best angle I came up with for now, the frog-anons would obviously have to help spread this in frog.","filename":"tiphaine macron ","ext":".jpg","w":833,"h":538,"tn_w":249,"tn_h":161,"tim":1493000228688,"time":1493000228,"md5":"qs9fUyXDWkADae7XC2MGAQ==","fsize":434363,"resto":0,"id":"D1g4l+nT","country":"SE","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"meme-macron-out-of-existence-tiphaine-edition","country_name":"Sweden","replies":23,"images":7,"unique_ips":8},{"no":122528097,"now":"04\/23\/17(Sun)22:21:05","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122527652\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122527652<\/a><br>bump, we need to meme this into reality<br><br>I&#039;ve just gathered up a 3 GB folder full of pepe le frog pictures and assembled a small army of centipedes who will post them all over Facebook to redpill the normies<br><br>MAGA","time":1493000465,"resto":122527652,"id":"u4m3Oix9","country":"CA","country_name":"Canada"},{"no":122528257,"now":"04\/23\/17(Sun)22:22:31","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122528097\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122528097<\/a><br>you leafs have strong cultural ties to the frogs, you speak their language, you could be of great use","time":1493000551,"resto":122527652,"id":"D1g4l+nT","country":"SE","country_name":"Sweden"},{"no":122528680,"now":"04\/23\/17(Sun)22:26:01","name":"Anonymous","com":"b-b-bump, I know Europe is asleep but don&#039;t you care across the pond,","time":1493000761,"resto":122527652,"id":"D1g4l+nT","country":"SE","country_name":"Sweden"},{"no":122529060,"now":"04\/23\/17(Sun)22:29:02","name":"Anonymous","com":"intereste&#039;d","time":1493000942,"resto":122527652,"id":"48tnQM4p","country":"ES","country_name":"Spain"},{"no":122529160,"now":"04\/23\/17(Sun)22:29:56","name":"Anonymous","com":"LOL. \/pol\/ should know that the French aren&#039;t as dumb as Americans.","filename":"C-HefcDXUAAlyuz","ext":".jpg","w":605,"h":276,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":57,"tim":1493000996964,"time":1493000996,"md5":"AAXBwWbG1Dhjd28yrrfwBg==","fsize":40535,"resto":122527652,"id":"fo7gYHVJ","country":"CA","country_name":"Canada"},{"no":122529240,"now":"04\/23\/17(Sun)22:30:42","name":"Anonymous","com":"what is the plan?","time":1493001042,"resto":122527652,"id":"48tnQM4p","country":"ES","country_name":"Spain"},{"no":122529336,"now":"04\/23\/17(Sun)22:31:34","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122529160\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122529160<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;macron in the lead<\/span><br>they seem to be a lot dumber at the moment","time":1493001094,"resto":122527652,"id":"D1g4l+nT","country":"SE","country_name":"Sweden"},{"no":122529588,"now":"04\/23\/17(Sun)22:33:54","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122527652\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122527652<\/a><br>This is highly memeable.

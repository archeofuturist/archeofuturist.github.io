We must think longer term and look to non-political solutions. Western Civilization is heading toward collapse regardless, the question is how we respond to events taking place outside our control to build a revolutionary movement and reshape our future. We must think creatively, employing every tool at our disposal. Learn to homestead. Marry an Aryan women and have at least 4 children. Homeschool them and live in a self-sufficient rural community. Learn to grow your own food. Lift weights, read books, and join right-wing armed groups. Drive into the city whenever the Left threatens violence and retaliate accordingly (the Battle of Berkeley was just a preview of whats to come). When the civil\/race wars break out, we will control the rural areas, i.e. the food, fresh water and raw materials. We will have more guns and physical training. When the global economy comes crashing down and we are forced to return to the basics, we will have the upper hand. The future can be ours, but we must have to employ every tool at our disposal to seize it. I look forward to fighting alongside each and every one of you who is willing to lay down your life in the name of securing a future for White Christian civilization.

We must think longer term and look to non-political solutions. Western Civilization is heading toward collapse regardless, the question is how we respond to events taking place outside our control to build a revolutionary movement and reshape our future. We must think creatively, employing every tool at our disposal. Learn to homestead. Marry an Aryan women and have at least 4 children. Homeschool them and live in a self-sufficient rural community. Learn to grow your own food. Lift weights, read books, and join right-wing armed groups. Drive into the city whenever the Left threatens violence and retaliate accordingly (the Battle of Berkeley was just a preview of whats to come). When the civil\/race wars break out, we will control the rural areas, i.e. the food, fresh water and raw materials. We will have more guns and physical training. When the global economy comes crashing down and we are forced to return to the basics, we will have the upper hand. The future can be ours, but we must have to employ every tool at our disposal to seize it. I look forward to fighting alongside each and every one of you who is willing to lay down your life in the name of securing a future for White Christian civilization.

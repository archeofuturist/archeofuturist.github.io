People in society constantly (and rightfully) spend time telling others to eat properly, exercise, have good manners, maintain healthy relationships, raise children properly, respect other people, protect the environment and respect property. There are behaviours that exist solely on an individual basis where there are no victims, like drug-use, drinking, self-harm, masturbation, overeating, extreme sports and unhealthy thought processes. We care about other people, so we try to prevent bad behaviour, even if it isn&#039;t our business to do so.<br>Literally not an argument.<br>As for this whole &quot;people think my sexuality is a threat&quot;, &quot;people are taking out their insecurities on me&quot;, &quot;I&#039;m being harassed&quot; and &quot;cis people are stalking me&quot;, well that is definitely an unhealthy thought process.","time":1490098487,"resto":117617590,"id":"iR0JObX7","country":"AU","country_name":"Australia"}]}

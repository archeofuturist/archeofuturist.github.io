I was watching his Auburn University speech and it&#039;s the most vapid shit imaginable. He talks like a cult leader, trying desperately to sound eloquent, but nothing he says has any meat to it. At one point he simply says that people who disagrees with him are fags, great fucking argument. He litterally says at one point that he doesn&#039;t care about facts. Also his speech was full of contradictions.<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;I&#039;m not racist, I&#039;m just looking out for white interests<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;I support free speech unconditionally <\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;but football should be banned because mostly black people play it<\/span><br>How is this any better then the &quot;facts are a social construct created by the patriarchy&quot; types?","filename":"download (1)","ext":".jpg","w":227,"h":222,"tn_w":227,"tn_h":222,"tim":1493235954077,"time":1493235954,"md5":"koZ7O6cfTPzWuQ7XUJwMOQ==","fsize":6563,"resto":0,"id":"PAiMV\/V9","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"i-seriously-hope-none-of-you-people-take-this-guy","country_name":"United States","replies":15,"images":3,"unique_ips":15},{"no":122928552,"now":"04\/26\/17(Wed)15:47:03","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122928381\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122928381<\/a><br>kys shill","filename":"0c3a958c0d0abdf03a9c6e9ba168f7361bcfd4c0139632cfab459d41038b3879","ext":".jpg","w":1298,"h":883,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":85,"tim":1493236023158,"time":1493236023,"md5":"AR4IlUe5CKPZixmNHOo1yA==","fsize":300035,"resto":122928381,"id":"4BI3\/Mk0","country":"IE","m_img":1,"country_name":"Ireland"},{"no":122928699,"now":"04\/26\/17(Wed)15:48:15","name":"Anonymous","com":"KYS. do better or shut up.","time":1493236095,"resto":122928381,"id":"wmr4blOp","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":122928702,"now":"04\/26\/17(Wed)15:48:16","name":"Anonymous","com":"I agree.

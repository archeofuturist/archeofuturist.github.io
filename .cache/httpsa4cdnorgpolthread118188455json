But you&#039;re not in despair. In fact, despite the circumstances, you&#039;re supremely energised; and in the warm air of the oncoming Prussian summer, you&#039;re beaming with expectant hope. <br><br>Because you&#039;re part of a movement that&#039;s going to reinvigorate your nation. Reshape it, and mould it into something far beyond the imaginations of your progenitors. There&#039;s a man, the future architect and general of this greater Germany, named Adolf Hitler. Upon him rests the hopes of an entire generation, an entire civilisation. You can already tell that he&#039;s a creature built from the same mould as the Alexanders, the Napoleons, and the Caesars of history, and under his banner you walk, hand-in-hand with comrades - the finest men you&#039;ve ever known - who share your innermost convictions, and of whom you&#039;re proud to call yourself a friend.<br><br>Things are moving so fast. The people, the media, and the government are quickly waking up to stupefying fact of your assent. Things previously thought only the private whispers of a few learned men are now sprawling public debates, you can see the scales falling from their eyes. At this pivotal moment, you&#039;re all the more hyped to spring into action, to win this first victory for your people...<br><br>My God son - you&#039;ve won! The beginning of the best hour of Germany has finally come! You&#039;ve never felt more elated, more validated than in this moment. You helped achieve this. Surely this is the role you were born to play. Dreams are steadily manifesting: then distant hopes, now grand plans. Upon the Reichstag waves the flag of your party.","filename":"hitler-youth-rally","ext":".jpg","w":800,"h":597,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":186,"tim":1490418134437,"time":1490418134,"md5":"zNxyjyNrJeV3asC5yYcZVw==","fsize":146076,"resto":0,"id":"K8NZjw8C","country":"AU","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"imagine-being-a-german-youth-in-the-early-20th","country_name":"Australia","replies":7,"images":5,"unique_ips":3},{"no":118188540,"now":"03\/25\/17(Sat)01:03:17","name":"Anonymous","com":"Many years down the track, you&#039;ve grown strong and healthy and happy in this new and revitalised Germania. You&#039;ve matured, and you&#039;re a firm part of this new Reich that is now more of a sober reality than a dream, but still no less of a miracle. Sacrifices have had to be made, but nothing exceptional has ever come without cost.<br><br>It&#039;s happened. The hour is at hand that will decide the fate of your people. This is the moment where Germany really makes its stand. The time for the enemies of your people to be shown what true might is has come. You wave goodbye to your beloved wife and children, leaving with not a doubt in your mind of what you are fighting for.<br><br>The war is harsh. After an initially strong and easygoing start, the conflict has grown cruel, and its hit hard. You&#039;ve had to leave many of your men in the dust - not only men, but boys. Boys that can&#039;t have been older than you were when you joined the party. There&#039;s been whispers that the war is not going as well as the higher ups have been saying.<br><br>Defeat.<br>Cities scourged. Women raped. Buildings torn down. The &quot;Fuhrer&quot;, the coward, killed himself. All the leaders, the men you used to hand out fliers about and shake hands with, have been hanged. Two of your children are dead, one died in a bombing raid, the other during the Battle of Berlin as part of the Hitlerjunge. <br>The world hates you. Millions have died in your wake. And all for what? A collective, explosive suicide.<br>There will be no Third Empire. <br><br>All that&#039;s left of Germany is the sad, grey centre-stage for the futile conflict between the capitalists and the communists.","filename":"Brandenburg_Gate","ext":".jpg","w":584,"h":469,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":100,"tim":1490418197114,"time":1490418197,"md5":"ExELNiaRU1hb3cr+m8Gqtg==","fsize":102183,"resto":118188455,"id":"K8NZjw8C","country":"AU","country_name":"Australia"},{"no":118189336,"now":"03\/25\/17(Sat)01:12:48","name":"Anonymous","com":"respond nazis<br>shicklgruberkins","time":1490418768,"resto":118188455,"id":"K8NZjw8C","country":"AU","country_name":"Australia"},{"no":118189374,"now":"03\/25\/17(Sat)01:13:13","name":"Anonymous","com":"The War never ended.<br><br>The yoke of World War 2 was put upon &quot;&quot;us&quot;&quot;, we are mere keyboard soldiers, fighting to restore the rightful European government.","filename":"1490318644429","ext":".jpg","w":240,"h":240,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":125,"tim":1490418793342,"time":1490418793,"md5":"TJiXXRXyYI2xp9+Hd0kV2g==","fsize":13923,"resto":118188455,"id":"q\/OnsfQq","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":118189586,"now":"03\/25\/17(Sat)01:15:44","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118189374\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118189374<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;rightful European government<\/span>","filename":"portrait_of_wilhelm_ii_by_kraljaleksandar-d2zu65g","ext":".jpg","w":800,"h":1068,"tn_w":93,"tn_h":125,"tim":1490418944936,"time":1490418944,"md5":"hxj9Yq2+6L8LPyMtSESJrQ==","fsize":206104,"resto":118188455,"id":"K8NZjw8C","country":"AU","m_img":1,"country_name":"Australia"},{"no":118189735,"now":"03\/25\/17(Sat)01:17:37","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118189586\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118189586<\/a>","filename":"Bundesarchiv_Bild_146-1976-127-06A,_Karl_D\u00f6nitz_-_crop","ext":".jpg","w":288,"h":403,"tn_w":89,"tn_h":125,"tim":1490419057906,"time":1490419057,"md5":"ELyBLw\/QKothWojcduNBrg==","fsize":61096,"resto":118188455,"id":"q\/OnsfQq","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":118190157,"now":"03\/25\/17(Sat)01:22:17","name":"Anonymous","com":"<span class=\"quote\">&gt;be norwegian american<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;great grandpapa volunteered to join the SS<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;do the K-12 being taught that my family has a special place in hell<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;find \/pol\/ after<\/span><br>And all for what?<br><br><br>That question still gets me...","time":1490419337,"resto":118188455,"id":"RbydoCB7","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":118191203,"now":"03\/25\/17(Sat)01:35:33","name":"Anonymous","com":"bUMP!!!!!!!!!!!!","filename":"nazi-cuteboys","ext":".jpg","w":405,"h":560,"tn_w":90,"tn_h":125,"tim":1490420133114,"time":1490420133,"md5":"TooLQv3gXa0CrV0TaqQ12A==","fsize":104082,"resto":118188455,"id":"K8NZjw8C","country":"AU","country_name":"Australia"}]}

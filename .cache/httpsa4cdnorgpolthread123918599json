Believe OUR LIES<\/span><br>https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Troll<wbr>s_from_Olgino<br><br>Trolls from Olgino is an Internet slang term which appeared in late 2014, referring to a series of fake accounts registered on major discussion boards (social networks, online newspaper sites, video hosting services, etc.) that were used for promoting the Russian point of view in topics involving Ukraine and the Middle East. The extent to which the Russian government tried to influence social media became widely known after a June 2014 BuzzFeed article greatly expanded on government documents published by hackers earlier that year.[2] Stemming from a December 2014 article, the term &quot;Trolls from Olgino&quot; gained worldwide media attention by June 2015, when one of the offices of a Russian company named Internet Research Agency, based in Saint Petersburg, was exposed as having data from fake accounts used for biased Internet trolling. Subsequently, there were news reports of individuals receiving monetary compensation for performing these tasks.<br><br>According to the testimonies of the investigative journalists and former employees of the offices, the main topics for posts included:<br><br>Criticism of Alexei Navalny, his sponsors, and Russian opposition in general;<br><br>Criticism of Ukraine&#039;s and the United States&#039; foreign policies, and of the top politicians of these states;<br><br>Praise for the policy of the Russian Federation and Vladimir Putin.<br><br>Journalists point out that themes of trolling were consistent with those of other Russian propaganda outlets in topics and timing. <br><br>Technical points used by trolls were taken mainly from Russia Today content.","time":1493829604,"resto":123918599,"id":"oACU4pUO","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":123930872,"now":"05\/03\/17(Wed)12:40:15","name":"Anonymous","com":"Thousands of extremists in the U.S homegrown and refugees inside our borders.","time":1493829615,"resto":123918599,"id":"BLAnXNf4","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":123930933,"now":"05\/03\/17(Wed)12:40:56","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123929554\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123929554<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;people are only allowed to use one site<\/span><br>If you really only feel comfortable on this shithole I feel bad for you, there are good subs if you avoid the defaults.

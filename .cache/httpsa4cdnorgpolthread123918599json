Why did the President, DoJ and FBI think the threat was so real they had to monitor one campaign but allowed the campaign making the accusations full privacy, even though the Hillary campaign was the ony campaign with a history of receiving money from the Russians? Why did Comey allow the DNC to spread Russian rumors and cause the investigate those rumors but not investigate the source of those rumors?

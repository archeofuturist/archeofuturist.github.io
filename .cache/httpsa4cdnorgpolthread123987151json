I can&#039;t say I&#039;m the only German man who finds it hard to take pride in his own country after having years of constant and needless attacks defaming my heritage from insecure losers here. Why not bully Americans or British? Do they not have much more to be ashamed of than our open-minded country? Indebted Greeks get bullied less than us and yet we are the purest humans in all of human civilization.<br><br>Like when its not just banter, when a meme is repeated over and over again, repeated systematically, it eventually becomes a truth irregardless of the intentions in repeating it. And that isn&#039;t just jokes any more then, then its harmful !<br>Would you call a German man a &quot;nazi&quot;(disgusting phrase) to his face? Would you say to a kind, peaceful and hard working salt of the earth German man that they are a &quot;liberal faggots&quot;? Like it&#039;s a thing. Would you say those words to your fellow european brother? Are you starting to feel ashamed now? You fucking degenerate?<br>You&#039;re destroying open-minded pride, you&#039;re dividing humans against each other, you&#039;re doing the opposite of what you claim to support when you engage in this incredibly abhorrent behavior. So I encourage you to stop now.","filename":"Flag_of_Germany.svg","ext":".png","w":1280,"h":768,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":150,"tim":1493855986603,"time":1493855986,"md5":"qEQYLlEYYxCPiW9DJV6sog==","fsize":4078,"resto":0,"id":"jQQfHCwW","country":"IT","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"seriously-the-bullying-against-german-members-of","country_name":"Italy","replies":0,"images":0,"unique_ips":1}]}

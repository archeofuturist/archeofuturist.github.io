And then every single day most of your population gains their understanding of the world at large through snippets of what they hear on a CNN radio station during transit to their job. Next imagine if, since the sixties, American media and most importantly, American schools, had taught all Americans since childhood that there is no such thing as American values, or American identity, or American culture. America is a cultural mosaic. America is simply a place where people of all cultures can live. There is no &quot;American&quot;. And then imagine that schools and media had enforced the idea that the one defining trait of America is that you&#039;re not Canadian, you don&#039;t want to be like them right?<br><br>This is more or less Canada. Decades of social programming to remove the idea of national identity and culture. It&#039;s much like Germans have had decades now of social programming to ingrain the idea that they are born with the original sin of Nazism in their blood, and must atone for their sin by relinquishing any self-interest or self-protection. Where America has still been allowed national pride in their media and schools and culture, other nations have had it &quot;educated&quot; out of them over decades by government controlled media and schooling.

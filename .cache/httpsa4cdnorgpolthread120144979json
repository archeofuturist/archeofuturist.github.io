At what precise moment in history this occurred is not certain but most probably the Sumerian language disappeared from India by 2000 BC. In this latter case there was no question of preserving it for ritual purposes either. This is because the IndoSumerian-Austric language never developed as a fully written language in India to inscribe full texts. In any case, a better Indo-Aryan language with its own full-fledged script soon emerged probably because of Hittite influences in the Indian sub-continent around that time.<\/span><br><br><a href=\"#p120151568\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120151568<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;explain this<\/span><br><br>see above.","time":1491669890,"resto":120144979,"id":"H9QpjsPj","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":120151708,"now":"04\/08\/17(Sat)12:44:56","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120144979\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120144979<\/a><br>if you have to ask, then you can&#039;t join, sorry.","time":1491669896,"resto":120144979,"id":"y9c94CLD","country":"RS","country_name":"Serbia"},{"no":120151773,"now":"04\/08\/17(Sat)12:45:19","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120145624\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120145624<\/a><br><a href=\"#p120145938\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120145938<\/a><br>kill yourself and burn in hell now one wants you <br>no one will hire a felon you life is over and you have nothing to live for, your family hates you for hurting that animals and as soon as any female finds out about your past she leave<br>the best hing you can do is kill yourself while taking as many other people as possible with you","time":1491669919,"resto":120144979,"id":"tInSd394","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":120151792,"now":"04\/08\/17(Sat)12:45:26","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120145123\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120145123<\/a><br>He sticks a cut 3mm into the Mic jack which overrides the laptop&#039;s built in Mic so no one can listen in.

Demoralisation through perception is the most commonly referred to means of demoralisation even though its operation and results like political warfare and psychological warfare in general, are the most difficult to gauge. That is the form of demoralisation that is referred to as a tool of psychological warfare, and it is most commonly implemented through various forms of propaganda. Propaganda as a tool of demoralisation refers to influencing opinion through significant symbols, through means such as rumors, stories, pictures, reports, and other means of social communication. Other means of political and psychological warfare, such as deception, disinformation, agents of influence, or forgeries, may also be used to destroy morale through psychological means so that belligerents start questioning the validity of their beliefs and actions.<br><a href=\"#p117607954\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;117607954<\/a><br>Highlander\/Innse Gall","filename":"IMG_1369","ext":".jpg","w":3000,"h":2345,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":97,"tim":1490088260443,"time":1490088260,"md5":"\/kDmOUqjgBDsSTrNMHHK0w==","fsize":1202069,"resto":117573715,"id":"cmzcFArM","country":"IL","m_img":1,"country_name":"Israel"},{"no":117608642,"now":"03\/21\/17(Tue)05:24:31","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p117608149\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;117608149<\/a><br>Old news, London&#039;s been irretrievable for at least a decade lad.

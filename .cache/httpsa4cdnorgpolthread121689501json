It is a genetic disposition. If you are genetically inclined to get cavities, brushing your teeth with hardly do anything to minimize the chance to getting them, if you are generically inclined to not get cavities, brushing won&#039;t do anything at all beyond damage your teeth.<br><br>If you have bad breath take a fucking mint or stop eating garbage, brushing teeth won&#039;t help that smell if you have an actual medical reason for that smell like halitosis or tonsil stones. <br><br>Tooth paste is worthless. Humans existed for hundreds of thousands of years without smearing chalk and jasmine and other perfume crap on their teeth. The &#039;fuzz&#039; you feel on teeth (fuzz is a marketing term to make you feel like it&#039;s gross) is not only completely natural, but beneficial in protecting your teeth - the human body evolved to have it and it protect your enamel like sewer slime protects city pipes. Getting rid of it is like getting rid of all the good bacteria in your gut (or mouth, as toxic mouthwash nukes your throat indiscriminately). Don&#039;t get me started on flossing, you&#039;re fucking destroying your gums, they are SUPPOSED to bleed when you tear them up with string! Almost as bad as ear swabs. <br><br>I have not brushed my teeth in twenty years, I only do it once thoroughly before going to the dentist every six months. Every single trip my dentist tells me I have perfect teeth that people should aspire to. This has cost me thousands of dollars. <br><br>The reason we all uncritically accept dentistry is because it&#039;s all rooted in tradition, practices dating back from when we thought arsenic and smoking was good for your health.","filename":"230592350231","ext":".png","w":320,"h":320,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":250,"tim":1492525247823,"time":1492525247,"md5":"htS99Qjqn54Y30O5DUs9tg==","fsize":211940,"resto":0,"id":"eBlvRL\/C","country":"AU","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"dentistry-is-largely-a-jewish-myth-beyond-a-few","country_name":"Australia","replies":5,"images":1,"unique_ips":5},{"no":121689653,"now":"04\/18\/17(Tue)10:22:49","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121689501\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121689501<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;A fucking ROO<\/span><br>Enjoy having breath that smells worse than fucking abbo shit, mate.","time":1492525369,"resto":121689501,"id":"iihrRKKZ","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":121689888,"now":"04\/18\/17(Tue)10:25:11","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121689501\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121689501<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Humans existed for hundreds of thousands of years without smearing chalk and jasmine and other perfume crap on their teeth.<\/span><br>We also didn&#039;t eat straight up sugar every day in the form of endless carbohydrates.

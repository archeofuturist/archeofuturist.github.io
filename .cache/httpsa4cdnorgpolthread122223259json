If you dare think differently than them and you have many followers, they will do everything to smear you and try to end your career. If they can&#039;t make accusations of racism, then they make accusations of sexual assault. Eventually they run out of smear tactics and use violence to shut you up. Milo Yiannopolus for example. You can&#039;t smear him for being homophobic because he&#039;s gay, xenophobic because he&#039;s an immigrant, anti semetist because he&#039;s Jewish, or racist because of his black boyfriend and many black followers. So what do they do? They literally try to burn down the building he was speaking at in Berkeley College. They could not smear him. So they shut him up with violence.

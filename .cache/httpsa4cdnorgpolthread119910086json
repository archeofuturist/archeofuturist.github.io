We weren&#039;t strong enough yet. But in 2016, we won. Memeing Trump into the presidency was the right thing to do.<br>Trump isn&#039;t perfect. He&#039;s far from it. He&#039;s a puppet of (((them))), just not quite to the extent that others like Hillary Clinton are. But he&#039;s slightly anti-establishment, though only slightly. He&#039;s controversial. And because of that, he&#039;s shaking things up. The Republican party is destroying itself because of Trump. Because of us. The Democratic party is destroying itself because of Bernie Sanders being cheated out of the nomination and because of its obsession with political correctness. People are learning the truth of the (((deep state))) and the false dichotomy of the two-party system, both sides of which are (((NWO))) puppets.<br><br>Getting Trump elected has paved the way for greater things to come. We did what we had to do, and we did a hell of a good job of it. And that was just the warmup. The 2016 election was the first battle, and we won that battle. But the war is only just getting started. Now it&#039;s time to shift gears and make what would have been unfathomable and impossible only a few years ago into reality. Ron Paul has always been our guy but he&#039;s too old now. His son Rand Paul will take up the mantle.<br><br>Now that things are shaken up, the establishment is vulnerable, and the path is paved, it&#039;s time for us to take advantage of this opportunity. It&#039;s time for us to shift gears and take meme magic to a new level. We have to take advantage of the fact that both the Republican party and the Democratic party are tearing themselves apart. Not each other; themselves. Each party is destroying itself. People are learning the truth and the establishment is weakening. We have the opportunity now to meme anyone we want into office. It&#039;s time for \/pol\/&#039;s true hero. In 2020, Rand Paul will be elected as the president of the United States.

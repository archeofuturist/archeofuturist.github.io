Hence John Locke&#039;s proviso that one has &quot;property&quot; in land only to the extent that there is &quot;enough, and as good left in common for others.&quot; When there is not, land begins to have rental value. Thus, the rental value of land reflects the extent to which Locke&#039;s proviso has been violated, thereby making community-collection of rent, or CCR, a just and necessary means of upholding the Lockean principle of private property. In the late 19th century CCR was known as the &quot;Single Tax&quot; -- a term that was (and is) used to denote Henry George&#039;s proposal to abolish all taxes save for a single &quot;tax&quot; on the value of land, irrespective of the value of improvements in or on it.<br><br>&quot;When we tax houses, crops, money, furniture, capital or wealth in any of its forms, we take from individuals what rightfully belongs to them.

The State had established one monopoly, -- the landlord&#039;s monopoly of economic rent, -- thereby shutting off great hordes of people from free access to the only source of human subsistence, and driving them into the factories to work for whatever Mr. Gradgrind and Mr. Bottles chose to give them. The land of England, while by no means nearly all actually occupied, was all legally occupied; and this State-created monopoly enabled landlords to satisfy their needs and desires with little exertion or none, but it also removed the land from competition with industry in the labour market, thus creating a huge, constant and exigent labour-surplus.&quot; [Emphasis Nock&#039;s]","filename":"24cbbb19d4975a359247ec9cb3c34c70","ext":".jpg","w":586,"h":290,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":61,"tim":1490888073564,"time":1490888073,"md5":"JMu7GdSXWjWSR+ycs8NMcA==","fsize":58574,"resto":118927000,"id":"9MmcGhpY","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":118931792,"now":"03\/30\/17(Thu)11:35:00","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118927000\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118927000<\/a><br><br><a href=\"\/pol\/thread\/118906899#p118906899\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118906899<\/a>","time":1490888100,"resto":118927000,"id":"GyTSExhp","country":"DE","country_name":"Germany"},{"no":118931794,"now":"03\/30\/17(Thu)11:35:01","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118927000\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118927000<\/a>","filename":"GoblinPepeNosed","ext":".png","w":1300,"h":1655,"tn_w":98,"tn_h":124,"tim":1490888101787,"time":1490888101,"md5":"xo9xkWoYtWV+WsaR2D7Lyg==","fsize":278227,"resto":118927000,"id":"fYvf7Hd+","country":"RO","country_name":"Romania"},{"no":118931796,"now":"03\/30\/17(Thu)11:35:02","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118931750\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118931750<\/a><br>This is why merely reducing the size of government is not enough. In the late 19th century we had virtually everything that most libertarians of today claim they are fighting for -- a tax and regulatory burden much lower than what we have now. Yet despite that fact, there was still an alarming rate of poverty amidst vast concentrations of wealth and privilege. And as Nock pointed out, this was due not to natural causes, but to the concentrated ownership of &quot;economic rent.&quot; <br><br>Thus, to secure a truly free and prosperous society, we must recognize and uphold both the exclusive right of each individual to the fruits of his or her labor, and the equal right of all individuals to the use of land. Abolishing taxes on production will uphold the former, while CCR will uphold the latter. Both Thomas Paine and Thomas Jefferson, in whose names the Libertarian Party bestows awards, held essentially the same view:<br><br>&quot;Men did not make the earth.... It is the value of the improvement only, and not the earth itself, that is individual property.... Every proprietor owes to the community a ground rent for the land which he holds.&quot; (Thomas Paine, Agrarian Justice, paragraphs 11 to 15)<br><br>&quot;Another means of silently lessening the inequality of [landed] property is to exempt all from taxation below a certain point, and to tax the higher portions of property in geometrical progression as they rise. Whenever there is in any country, uncultivated lands and unemployed poor, it is clear that the laws of property have been so far extended as to violate natural right. The earth is given as common stock for man to labour and live on. If, for the encouragement of industry we allow it to be appropriated, we must take care that other employment be furnished to those excluded from the appropriation. If we do not the fundamental right to labour the earth returns to the unemployed&quot; (Thomas Jefferson, The Republic of Letters, p. 390).","filename":"emmememe","ext":".jpg","w":1000,"h":1000,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":125,"tim":1490888102917,"time":1490888102,"md5":"ii2fbCLmnFokum3pcpYiXg==","fsize":250049,"resto":118927000,"id":"9MmcGhpY","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":118931895,"now":"03\/30\/17(Thu)11:36:00","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118931796\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118931796<\/a><br>But Doesn&#039;t a Tax on Land Value Drive Up the Price of Land?<br><br>No, just the reverse. In order for a tax to drive up the price of something, it must either decrease supply or increase demand. Does the land value tax (LVT) decrease the supply of land? No, because the supply of land is fixed. Thus, the only way it can increase the price is by increasing demand. Yet not even those who oppose the LVT argue that it increases demand, so it follows that the LVT does not increase the price of land, since it neither decreases supply nor increases demand. <br><br>In fact, it actually lowers the price of land by reducing the amount of rent that can be capitalized into a sale price. Expressed in mathematical terms, the price of land p equals the annual rent r divided by the interest rate i, or:<br><br>p = r \/ i<br><br>If there is a tax rate t on the price of land p, then p equals the rent divided by the sum of the interest rate and the offsetting tax rate, or:<br><br>p = r \/ (i + t)<br><br>Thus, if the rent is $1,000, the interest rate is 10%, and the tax rate 40%, then the price would be 1,000\/(.10 + .40), or $2,000. Without the tax, the price would be 80% higher -- $10,000. This is why there is no long term benefit to cutting the LVT, because people in general, and the working poor in particular, end up paying back in higher rents and land prices what they presumably get from the tax cut. (Click here to see a recent example of this.)<br><br>Unfortunately, because the &quot;property&quot; tax fuses the tax on land value with the tax on improvements, people have a tendency to equate one with the other, and thus falsely assume that a lower tax on land value yields the same benefits as a lower tax on improvements. It in fact has the opposite effect. A lower tax on improvements rewards people for putting land to productive use, which means more jobs and higher wages; a lower tax on land value rewards people for holding land out of use, which means less jobs and lower wages.","filename":"billbo","ext":".jpg","w":400,"h":252,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":78,"tim":1490888160470,"time":1490888160,"md5":"AZbSj\/p7Ju7v269jobTTQg==","fsize":44741,"resto":118927000,"id":"9MmcGhpY","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":118931988,"now":"03\/30\/17(Thu)11:37:05","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118931895\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118931895<\/a><br>Where Do Other Libertarians Stand On The Taxation of Land Value?<br>Some support the LVT, others oppose it, while still others remain undecided.

Should the builder of the first transcontinental railroad own the continent? Shouldn&#039;t we at least have to pay a toll to cross the tracks? Are there no common rights to the earth at all? To royal libertarians there are not, but classical liberals recognized that unlimited ownership of land never flowed from use, but from the state:<br><br>A right of property in movable things is admitted before the establishment of government. A separate property in lands not till after that establishment.... He who plants a field keeps possession of it till he has gathered the produce, after which one has as good a right as another to occupy it. Government must be established and laws provided, before lands can be separately appropriated and their owner protected in his possession.

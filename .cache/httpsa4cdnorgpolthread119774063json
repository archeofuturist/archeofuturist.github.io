Because if you can\u2019t make anything of your own, individual life, then how can you think you\u2019ll be able to make a difference for the race, for the lives of many? Spend your time wisely, and keep your real life priorities in order.","time":1491504241,"resto":119774063,"id":"kIWM+OM6","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":119775668,"now":"04\/06\/17(Thu)14:44:04","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119774063\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119774063<\/a>","filename":"Romania","ext":".gif","w":128,"h":103,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":100,"tim":1491504244911,"time":1491504244,"md5":"ccwFkXvq1YVdlkB38A4VEw==","fsize":11709,"resto":119774063,"id":"SSRPXRlB","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":119775675,"now":"04\/06\/17(Thu)14:44:08","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119775095\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119775095<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Sarin isn&#039;t hard to produce<\/span><br>4 times in the history of the world Sarin gas has been used<br><br>Saddam&#039;s gassing<br><br>A Japanese cult leader<br><br>East Ghoutta gassing <br><br>And the gassing of two days ago","time":1491504248,"resto":119774063,"id":"fveP2rd+","country":"CA","country_name":"Canada"},{"no":119775683,"now":"04\/06\/17(Thu)14:44:10","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119775432\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119775432<\/a><br>Go back to Syria Ahmed<br>Syrian rapefugees are not welcome in France","filename":"syrian rapist","ext":".jpg","w":450,"h":300,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":83,"tim":1491504250529,"time":1491504250,"md5":"07kbCM87k2Wm3cxti1N2sg==","fsize":31010,"resto":119774063,"id":"aHKh+hLB","country":"FR","country_name":"France"},{"no":119775738,"now":"04\/06\/17(Thu)14:44:31","name":"Charlie India Alpha","com":"<a href=\"#p119775494\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119775494<\/a><br>There wouldn&#039;t be much evidence, since it&#039;s gas.

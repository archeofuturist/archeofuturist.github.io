Take, for example, his remarks about NATO in which he admitted to not knowing what NATO was or how it operated.<\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;&gt;They had a quote from me that NATO\u2019s obsolete. But they didn\u2019t say why it was obsolete. I was on Wolf Blitzer, very fair interview, the first time I was ever asked about NATO, because I wasn\u2019t in government. People don\u2019t go around asking about NATO if I\u2019m building a building in Manhattan, right? So they asked me, Wolf \u2026 asked me about NATO, and I said two things. NATO\u2019s obsolete \u2014 not knowing much about NATO, now I know a lot about NATO \u2014 NATO is obsolete, and I said, \u201cAnd the reason it\u2019s obsolete is because of the fact they don\u2019t focus on terrorism.\u201d You know, back when they did NATO there was no such thing as terrorism.<\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;\u201cBack when they did NATO\u201d? What? I assume he meant \u201cwhen they created NATO\u201d but what actually came out sounded not unlike when you ask a child his or her age and they hold up five fingers and answer \u201cthis many.\u201d As for terrorism not existing when NATO was created \u2014 it\u2019s hard to know what to say. No, terrorism has existed since the dawn of civilization, contrary to Trump\u2019s assumption that it\u2019s somehow a recent phenomenon. Worse, he based his entire NATO platform \u2014 the idea that it\u2019s obsolete and they have to pay up (for something, something, something) \u2014 on an answer he yanked out of his ass with the help of Wolf Blitzer, apparently.<\/span>","time":1493127358,"resto":122733812,"id":"\/CWiKW\/Z","country":"KR","country_name":"South Korea"},{"no":122734390,"now":"04\/25\/17(Tue)09:37:41","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122734142\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122734142<\/a><br>Haha.

When you think of it, our very fucking existence is fucking insane, and t you it might not, because you were taught that the big bang happened, and organisms slowly evolved into more complex, bigger beings that eventually resulted in what we are now.

The forces at play in a tornado do not create scenarios that would build the system. It can&#039;t bend or weld metal efficiently, for example. Also there are likely not enough of the proper materials lying around in a scrapyard, such as all the metals and rubbers used in wiring.

In both of these ways your argument is flawed.<br><br>If a device that can do literally anything at random was used an infinite number of times on a pile of materials that consist of everything needed to create a jet, it is a statistical FACT that the machine would build a jet sooner or later, and in fact if it continued from there it would eventually dismantle that plane, then rebuild it into another jet that has the words &quot;God isn&#039;t real&quot; welded onto the wings.","time":1492734439,"resto":122060182,"id":"UDtDzxII","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":122069435,"now":"04\/20\/17(Thu)20:27:25","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122063872\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122063872<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;incoming mental gymnastics<\/span>","time":1492734445,"resto":122060182,"id":"VhUz9lf2","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":122069453,"now":"04\/20\/17(Thu)20:27:34","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122068296\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122068296<\/a><br>so you&#039;re part of the &quot;takes religion seriously and literally&quot; camp i take it? you believe that people who knew more about the star systems than the average person today believed that the orbit of the sun was because a few horses were pulling it. seems plausible<br><br><a href=\"#p122068277\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122068277<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;metaphorical representations of complex natural phenomenons that usually heavily simplifies them for better comprehension and understanding still cannot penetrate my thick skull <\/span><br>here is more fundamental failure to understand what religion even is. and grouping a kike subverted monotheistic religion like christianity two polytheistic european ones is silly, but of course i wouldnt expect you to understand why","time":1492734454,"resto":122060182,"id":"B3q5gEAS","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":122069455,"now":"04\/20\/17(Thu)20:27:35","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122069294\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122069294<\/a><br>Do you say it about the Universe?","time":1492734455,"resto":122060182,"id":"3HJ82ZlW","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":122069544,"now":"04\/20\/17(Thu)20:28:30","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122060182\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122060182<\/a><br>Earth is the only planet to have only one moon.

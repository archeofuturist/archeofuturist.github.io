The purpose of the order was to facilitate the reduction of certificates in circulation, not to increase them. In October 1964 the Treasury ceased issuing them entirely. The Coinage Act of 1965 (PL 89-81) ended the practice of using silver in most U.S. coins, and in 1968 Congress ended the redeemability of silver certificates (PL 90-29). E.O. 11,110 was never reversed by President Johnson and remained on the books until 1987 when there was a general cleaning-up of executive orders (E.O. 12,608, 9\/9\/87). However, by this time the remaining legislative authority behind E.O. 11,110 had been repealed by Congress with PL 97-258 in 1982.2<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;In summary, E.O. 11,110 did not create new authority to issue additional silver certificates. In fact, its intention was to ease the process for their removal so that small denomination Federal Reserve Notes could replace them in accordance with a law Kennedy himself signed. If Kennedy had really sought to reduce Federal Reserve power, then why did he sign a bill that gave the Fed still more power?<\/span>","time":1493223026,"resto":122897417,"id":"w4Wt1vol","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":122900479,"now":"04\/26\/17(Wed)12:10:53","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122897417\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122897417<\/a><br>Prince Charles assassination attempt in Australia<br><br>https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=9e_<wbr>GoHngOIE","time":1493223053,"resto":122897417,"id":"\/TMJkD+o","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":122900518,"now":"04\/26\/17(Wed)12:11:12","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122900366\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122900366<\/a><br>No where near as stylish.","time":1493223072,"resto":122897417,"id":"3kBQzKxO","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":122900579,"now":"04\/26\/17(Wed)12:11:43","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122900311\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122900311<\/a><br>Another tranny.

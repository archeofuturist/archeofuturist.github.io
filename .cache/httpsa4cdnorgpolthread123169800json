The level of retardation increases exponentially the moment you cross county lines getting closer to San Francisco. It doesn&#039;t matter which road, but on the 101 it&#039;s pretty damn obvious. Mendo to Sonoma the people suddenly think 75 is the slowest one can drive. Sonoma to Marin it becomes a clusterfuck of a free-for-all. SF is driving retardation mecca. Only Baton Rouge comes close. <br><br>On the flip side I stayed in Moldova for a while. Chisinau seemed to have basically no speed limit or road standards, was basically a free for all on every street. And it worked. Sure some people sped (mainly taxis) but for the most part I encountered far more polite drivers there.","time":1493372439,"resto":123169800,"id":"3FhyZuOu","country":"US","country_name":"United States"}]}

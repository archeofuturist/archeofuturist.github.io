Has many family still there and thank God they have all survived so far even under IS occupation while they are Armenian Christian.<br><br>Unfortunately the motivation for the bigger countries to make an end to this in they all want something different as an outcome to Syria is being town apart in that struggle with no real concern for the real people who live there.<br><br>Here we see it as a civil war. My friend from Aleppo says the rebels want an islamic fundementalist state where his family would be second class people or worse just killed.<br><br>This side of the rebels is never reported here. They are just freedom fighters rising up against the crazy Assad who likes to bomb his innocent citizens for fun.<br><br>So Russia wants Syria to remain with Assad who is cooperative with Russian interests .<br><br>I do not expect Russia will willingly stand by and see Syria taken by forces who will give favor to America and Israel because of course Israel is really the one keeping this going.<br><br> Why I don&#039;t really see because Assad has not been hurting Israel directly.<br><br>The idea that Syria allows Iran to Arm Hezbollah in Lebanon through Syria keeps coming up as a reason Israel wants Assad gone even to the point of helping IS and other Sunni.<br><br>This religious divide is clearly the problem which has never been resolved in a thousand years so expecting it to resolve here is just not a reasonable expectation.","filename":"krak-des-chevaliers-cyria","ext":".jpg","w":1280,"h":800,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":156,"tim":1491680377342,"time":1491680377,"md5":"oZ9Aa2nxJ752mpFJ9HXIgA==","fsize":254901,"resto":0,"id":"ZTLOQAiQ","country":"US","m_img":1,"bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"syrian-poster-from-other-thread-reply","country_name":"United States","replies":0,"images":0,"unique_ips":1}]}

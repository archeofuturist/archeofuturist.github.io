It is the dot of WHITE DEFIANCE. Minimalist in the extreme, the white defiance dot can be inserted almost anywhere without drawing immediate attention -- On a school bulletin board, on a library table. It can even be used as a tattoo. The beauty of the white defiance dot is that it maximizes the &#039;plausible deniability&#039; factor, while making accusers seem ridiculous. It&#039;s just a dot. But, of course, we know that that won&#039;t stop the enemies of white pride from crying about it!<br><br>Also important to appreciate is the large measure of confusion and distrust among the enemy that this WILL cause -- Is that small dot off by itself on the bathroom stall that new white supremacist symbol I&#039;ve been hearing so much about?! Damn, I never thought I would see that at my school... I&#039;d better notify my sociology professor and the Diversity Office.<br><br>THIS CAN BE HUGE. Even in FIGHTING AGAINST this, the enemy is made WEAKER, in that he is tacitly admitting the INTRINSIC POWER of white pride.<br><br>.","filename":"1493663840913","ext":".jpg","w":566,"h":622,"tn_w":227,"tn_h":250,"tim":1493773175265,"time":1493773175,"md5":"JltkAbHsV81GYDDTP3StOQ==","fsize":97594,"resto":0,"id":"ohM5mquT","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"so-youve-seen-the-new-hand-signs-of-the-growing","country_name":"United States","replies":0,"images":0,"unique_ips":1}]}

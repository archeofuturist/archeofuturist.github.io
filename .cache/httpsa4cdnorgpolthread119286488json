political strategy for a party, not personnal ideological construction, if you really believe Hitler didn&#039;t recycle ideas and concept from people like Nietzsche or Marx you are an idiot, he didn&#039;t craft his ideology ex-nihilo, he read a lot, took things then dropped others.<br>What he said is that as a political movement you should never expand by making ideological concessions on your core principles and that&#039;s right but that doesn&#039;t apply in our current situation, Peterson is an university professor, not a political leader or an aspiring one, it&#039;s not because I decide to listen to his teachings and take note that I will espouse all his convictions.<br><br>Also he was 100% wrong about Christianity, christianism imposed itself through compromise and at very rare exception via fanaticism (Charlemagne beating the shit out of the Saxons or the baltic crusades are the two only example I can think about of forced conversion), just visit a church in Egypt, Peru and Rome and you will realize how much syncretism there is, holidays are probably the most obvious example of christianism adapting to paganism in order to impose itself.<br><br>Finally if you really knew something about nazis you would realize that there was heavy ideological divides between nazi leaders, Himmler and Goebbels for example were opposed on a lot of subjects.<br>Even Hitler ideology progressively evolved after his first victories to a more continental vision (nothing suprising with that, it&#039;s a mechanism you find in all conquerors, from Alexander the Great to Napol\u00e9on).","filename":"IdontthinkShariahbloodyallowsit","ext":".jpg","w":250,"h":286,"tn_w":109,"tn_h":125,"tim":1491206934898,"time":1491206934,"md5":"EuUVsLKVG0NhjvCMPY+Yrg==","fsize":16538,"resto":119286488,"id":"o\/DSFY+5","country":"FR","country_name":"France"},{"no":119306181,"now":"04\/03\/17(Mon)04:10:31","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a

You guys on the other hand just straight up deny shit when there is immense amount of factual evidence as well as documentation about the Greek-Armenian Genocide and ethnic cleansing campaigns. Usually when confronted by overwhelming evidence, rather than feeling ashamed about the previous assertion, many Turks I&#039;ve argued with over this either go further in denial, move the goalpost, deflect topic OR go full jingoism mode saying how Turks were justified in their actions and that Armenians and Greeks are scum and bastard people that should be ruled by Turks and that the world doesn&#039;t have the balls to do anything about muh future Ottoman superpower (wonder which road you&#039;re gonna take).

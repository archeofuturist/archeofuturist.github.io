They also defend their journalists against government overreach, which is admirable (suing government agencies for release of FOIA records, defending a journalist who the Canadian government demands hand over communications with a source). <br><br>What they produce that should be ignored or is harmful in its exposure to their young, impressionable audience is their shock value social commentary which is tortured in its ironic self-contradictions. They make it easy to sort this content out from their legitimate news articles, at least.<br><br>Then there&#039;s the fact that they do not include credits for individuals associated with producing their famous documentaries. These credits would be huge to anyone building a portfolio in the industry, but they&#039;re sacrificed for the cost of brand integrity, which is a very selfish move on the part of the company.","time":1491169270,"resto":119248022,"id":"tpMGj5R0","country":"CA","country_name":"Canada"},{"no":119249830,"now":"04\/02\/17(Sun)17:41:14","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119249700\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119249700<\/a>","filename":"1491168101969","ext":".png","w":1314,"h":1503,"tn_w":109,"tn_h":125,"tim":1491169274220,"time":1491169274,"md5":"+A5k507QPzhv4REL963mNA==","fsize":1932140,"resto":119248022,"id":"masAVb0b","country":"BG","m_img":1,"country_name":"Bulgaria"},{"no":119250988,"now":"04\/02\/17(Sun)17:51:50","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119249819\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119249819<\/a><br>Agreed, they&#039;re very good at reporting on some issues but take an extreme turn when discussing politics for some reason. However one documentary I saw that got me TRIGGERED was the one where two white dudes travel down Route 66. They meet up with a group of Native American skaters and the white guilt was just obscene. Was appalling how apologetic they were to them. You shouldn&#039;t have to apologize to them for just being white that some white people did hundreds of years ago, it was disgusting. Also Desus &amp; Miro is just moronic and a parody of a news show.","time":1491169910,"resto":119248022,"id":"KVgXvfLR","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":119251467,"now":"04\/02\/17(Sun)17:56:33","name":"Pizza Hut","com":"<a href=\"#p119249830\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119249830<\/a><br>who the fuk is that idiot","time":1491170193,"resto":119248022,"id":"FjYk+AI7","country":"AU","country_name":"Australia"}]}

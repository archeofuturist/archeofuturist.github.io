In my experience, this is at least true insofar as they are more tolerable than blacks, spics, and sandniggers. I grew up in a suburb of LA that has the highest demographic of 1st and 2nd generation East Asian americans in the country, went to primary\/secondary school with a ton of Asians, and pursued STEM in college, so I&#039;ve had casual and friendly relationships with asians. I have even dated 2 asian girls and gotten to know their families over the course of the relationships. So my question arises not out of a state of ignorance, but of discomfort with the implications of my own observations. <br><br>Why is it that in my entire life I&#039;ve not met a single Asian who possesses the irreducibly complex inner reality referred to as a human soul? I have not associated with Asians personally since my university days (when I came to this realization) because I can&#039;t find in any of them any of the aspects that I&#039;m looking for in a fruitful adult friendship. Asians don&#039;t seem to cultivate personal identity or knowledge of arts\/philosophy of their own volition, nor do they seem to experience life with the same sense of self-important individualism that embodies the best aspects of western society. I can see that they have somewhat of a drive toward achievment in life, and that they abide by at least some simulacrum of morality, and yet literally NONE of the hundreds of asians that I&#039;ve met in my life have seemed to have that &quot;spark&quot; of personality seems essentially commonplace in white people.<br><br>Why is this so? If Asians have high IQ why do the vast majority of them come off as boring\/intellectually empty\/milquetoast retards?","filename":"1111111111","ext":".jpg","w":500,"h":374,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":187,"tim":1492154474512,"time":1492154474,"md5":"SSRrocUUH\/lzP0HGdLfxLA==","fsize":42997,"resto":0,"id":"oOIcTHnq","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"are-asians-actually-complete-humans","country_name":"United States","replies":164,"images":38,"unique_ips":69,"tail_size":50},{"no":121033002,"now":"04\/14\/17(Fri)03:27:12","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121032587\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121032587<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;muh souls<\/span>","time":1492154832,"resto":121032587,"id":"fwbuXn0t","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":121033159,"now":"04\/14\/17(Fri)03:29:23","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121033002\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121033002<\/a><br>There are aspects to human personality that are so complex as to warrant use of hand-wavey words like &quot;soul&quot; in order even to refer to such a phenomenon in a conversation.

Asian parents are not integrated, and work for most part, on their respective parallel Asian cultures that form within the West (China town, K-town, etc etc), so they have no idea what their children are facing when it comes to identity, nor do they have the time and energy to.

Completely abandon any Western influence and relegate to FOB-like existence for your entire life, even if you were born here.<br><br>2.

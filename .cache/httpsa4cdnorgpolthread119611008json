Syria is basically a highly prosperous dictatorship in the Levant that is financially independent from Israel, won&#039;t allow western forces to put an oil pipeline through the country, and is in Russia&#039;s sphere of influence. ISIS, being a tool of the U.S., Israel, the Arabs, and our other &quot;allies,&quot; is there to destabilize the place so we can have another situation like Libya and Afghanistan. The &quot;rebels&quot; don&#039;t exist. There are several factions of them, but they are essentially ISIS. There is literally no reason for the average European nor American to give a shit about Syria, but we got lied to about &quot;muh gas attack&quot; back in 2012 and they&#039;re doing it again now. It&#039;s similar to the &quot;muh weapons of mass destruction&quot; argument we got in Iraq.<br><br>In short, Bashar al-Assad is \/ourguy\/, we&#039;ve backed them and Putin since the beginning and on several boards, and Syria would be based if we got rid of ISIS and its sympathizers.","time":1491403992,"resto":119611008,"id":"G9Ixf303","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":119613714,"now":"04\/05\/17(Wed)10:56:00","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119613434\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119613434<\/a><br>That&#039;s pretty clear.

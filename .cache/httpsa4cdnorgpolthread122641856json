Hopefully someone smarter can make this info look nice so that we finally have an image the shows the actual terror attacks in the country and lists the vitctims and shows factually, with the data and source on the image itself, so we can post this every time so idiotic leftist tries to say muslims commit less terror than whites.","filename":"terror since 2010","ext":".png","w":4772,"h":1922,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":100,"tim":1493069840186,"time":1493069840,"md5":"5GrbgIGq3S5FYqvfZAnX7w==","fsize":610818,"resto":0,"id":"w70k3LqY","country":"US","m_img":1,"bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"can-anyone-with-any-semblance-of-skill-with-this","country_name":"United States","replies":1,"images":1,"unique_ips":1},{"no":122642228,"now":"04\/24\/17(Mon)17:40:13","name":"Anonymous","com":"Whoops there was a typo on the right side. 29 victims of white terror attacks, not 32","filename":"terror since 2010","ext":".png","w":4772,"h":1922,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":50,"tim":1493070013689,"time":1493070013,"md5":"MOF38+fQGJoKgdL9pllkLw==","fsize":610788,"resto":122641856,"id":"w70k3LqY","country":"US","m_img":1,"country_name":"United States"}]}

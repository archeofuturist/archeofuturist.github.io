The expenses were always large, assuming the price of an amtrak ticket isn&#039;t that high, and that they were paying for travel for many individuals. The O&#039;Keefe videos showed us that they were willing to pay protesters to cause problems, and I think this proves that they are actually paying the travel expenses for a cadre of professional protesters. I have only gone into this 3 or 4 pages. There has to be more.

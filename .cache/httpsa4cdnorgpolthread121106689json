You can see that, despite outliers, things tend to unfold a certain way-- QM is probabilistic, not lolsorandumxd. To extend the metaphor even further, it&#039;s possible to ascertain what moral principles tend to lead to bad outcomes for society, and which ones can be relied upon to at least make life tolerable for most. There&#039;s no guarantee you&#039;re not going to have a run of bad or good luck, but despite what they say you CAN hedge your bets.<br><br>The worst thing about postmodernism is that, unless you&#039;re considering the marxist baggage that&#039;s almost always comes with it, it&#039;s right. There really IS no objective reality, at least when determining things like how you should live, or whether city or country life is better, or whether human life has value. All postmodernism can tell you is it&#039;s up to YOU to decide what you value.<br><br>But most modern postmodernists take it in an absolute fuck-headed direction, using the fact that there&#039;s no objective value system to browbeat others into following THEIR value system. &quot;If there&#039;s no right or wrong, it doesn&#039;t matter if I do wrong as long as I tell myself I&#039;m right.&quot; <br><br>It&#039;s totally fucked up, it puts value on propagating the meme above all else-- it doesn&#039;t matter if people kill each other under its influence, all that matters is that the idea stays pure...ish.

In this view, one might experience jealousy upon seeing one&#039;s spouse flirt with another (because of the fear of losing the spouse), while one might experience envy upon seeing a friend with an attractive date (because of one&#039;s desire to have an attractive date of one&#039;s own). In common usage, this distinction is not always observed, and jealousy and jealous are often used in situations that involve envy. Our 2015 survey shows that the distinction is alive and well: large majorities of the Usage Panel approved the traditional uses of jealousy (She was jealous when she saw her husband having dinner with another woman) and envy (He was envious of the expensive sports car his neighbor bought), while only a minority accepted the switched uses: 29 percent accepted envious for the suspicious dinner, and 34 percent accepted jealous for the expensive sports car. The last figure does mean, though, that a third of the Panelists accept jealous meaning &quot;envious,&quot; and an even larger minority (43 percent) accept it when the entity being coveted is a person rather than an object, as in Never having been popular myself, I&#039;m jealous of your many friends. It is evident from these results that many careful writers prefer to see the distinction between the two words maintained, with jealous being reserved for situations where one fears losing something and envious used for situations where one wants what one does not have.<\/span><br><br>So it has been changing recently. It seems kind of doubtful they had anything to do with it de-su, it&#039;s really hard to control language-- prescriptivists have been failing at it for centuries.

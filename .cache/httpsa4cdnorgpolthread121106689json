You can see that, despite outliers, things tend to unfold a certain way-- QM is probabilistic, not lolsorandumxd. To extend the metaphor even further, it&#039;s possible to ascertain what moral principles tend to lead to bad outcomes for society, and which ones can be relied upon to at least make life tolerable for most. There&#039;s no guarantee you&#039;re not going to have a run of bad or good luck, but despite what they say you CAN hedge your bets.<br><br>The worst thing about postmodernism is that, unless you&#039;re considering the marxist baggage that&#039;s almost always comes with it, it&#039;s right. There really IS no objective reality, at least when determining things like how you should live, or whether city or country life is better, or whether human life has value. All postmodernism can tell you is it&#039;s up to YOU to decide what you value.<br><br>But most modern postmodernists take it in an absolute fuck-headed direction, using the fact that there&#039;s no objective value system to browbeat others into following THEIR value system. &quot;If there&#039;s no right or wrong, it doesn&#039;t matter if I do wrong as long as I tell myself I&#039;m right.&quot; <br><br>It&#039;s totally fucked up, it puts value on propagating the meme above all else-- it doesn&#039;t matter if people kill each other under its influence, all that matters is that the idea stays pure...ish.

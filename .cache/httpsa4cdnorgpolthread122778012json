Antarctica wasn&#039;t always covered with Ice, It looked like pic-related as little as 10,000 years ago.<br>&quot;Modern&quot; humans have been around for around 250,000, and Europeans have been living in Europe for around 45,000 years.<br>There is no reason to think that Antarctica was uninhabited prior to the ice age. Humans are EVERYWHERE. Even tiny pacific Islands. <br><br>Antarctica prior to the ice age was ideal. The population would have had abundant natural resources like those of Africa, they would also have very likely been the FIRST sea-fairing population ever due to it&#039;s Island-nature and how the largest islands can only be accessed and left via boats. They would have been extremely proficient sailors. Everywhere in the old world and New world can be accessed by land however, even if the journey is very long.<br><br>We only became proficient sailors and &quot;discovered&quot; America in 1492. However, boats have been discovered which were 900,000 (yes, NINE-HUNDRED THOUSAND) years old:<br>&quot;Dugouts are the oldest type of boats found by archaeologists, and boats have served as transportation since the earliest times. Circumstantial evidence, such as the early settlement of Australia over 40,000 years ago, findings in Crete dated 130,000 years ago, and findings in Flores dated to 900,000 years ago, suggest that boats have been used since prehistoric times.&quot;<br>From: https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Boat#<wbr>History","filename":"meltantartica","ext":".jpg","w":450,"h":372,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":206,"tim":1493150268621,"time":1493150268,"md5":"76XD9Dn5DdUv\/Hj835rYEg==","fsize":53361,"resto":0,"id":"O4q3\/iIt","country":"GB","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"antarctica-civilisation","country_name":"United Kingdom","replies":68,"images":12,"unique_ips":25},{"no":122778120,"now":"04\/25\/17(Tue)15:58:34","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122778012\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122778012<\/a><br>It is absolutely ridiculous to think ancient civilisations would have not invented the sail or navigational tools in that amount of time.

They would have had to be completely insane.

It&#039;s a loud platform that would get picked up by SOSUS or a SURTASS in a heartbeat. It&#039;s within the realm of possibility that KPN could attempt delivery of frogmen with backpack nukes or dirty bombs via submarine, but it would be a one way trip to the West coast, even if they aren&#039;t detected; Romeo doesn&#039;t carry enough fuel to make it back to Korea. <br><a href=\"#p120797033\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120797033<\/a><br>Even back in 1968 SOSUS was able to pick up the USS Scorpion&#039;s hull collapsing from thousands of miles away from any array. A combination of permanent SOSUS tripwires, SURTASS sweeps, and aerial sonobuoy monitoring will ensure any sub approaching the coast is heard, at least one the KPN has.","filename":"Minsk_bow_RBU-6000_launcher_side","ext":".jpg","w":2048,"h":1536,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":93,"tim":1492028607316,"time":1492028607,"md5":"ueVYhxZ6BoFpdJGusxjpzg==","fsize":653809,"resto":120796265,"id":"u5nICrm1","country":"US","m_img":1,"country_name":"United States"},{"no":120802888,"now":"04\/12\/17(Wed)16:23:49","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120796426\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120796426<\/a><br><a href=\"#p120796639\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120796639<\/a><br><a href=\"#p120797460\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120797460<\/a><br><a href=\"#p120798782\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120798782<\/a><br>Confirmed non-quals","filename":"subpin","ext":".gif","w":460,"h":131,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":35,"tim":1492028629222,"time":1492028629,"md5":"gPSYjF+UfabHeTzw4SQ0BA==","fsize":37799,"resto":120796265,"id":"A030opbG","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":120803143,"now":"04\/12\/17(Wed)16:25:39","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120796265\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120796265<\/a><br><br>If it was actually a threat you wouldn&#039;t be reading about it on the web.

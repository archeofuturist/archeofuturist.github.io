While there might be more just individuals offering justice elsewhere, what is to stop someone from creating a local monopoly of injustice and corruption?<\/span><br>Great question.<br><br>The answer is that most people would be armed to the teeth in case this problem ever arose. After all, who would first give up their arms (the most immediate and personal form of self-defense) in order to be protected by a supposed insurance\/defense agency? Insurers and defense agencies would be interested in having their clients armed (and well-trained), so as to deter criminality and therefore keep premium prices low. <br><br>In case this did not happen, and indeed one company decided to attempt to become a rogue monopolist, these questions arise:<br><br>a) How would they fund it?<br>After all, that company too must have had massive capital in order to attempt pulling off such stunt. If any security agency decided to aggress against its own customers by becoming a monopoly, it would go instantly bankrupt because people would simply stop paying up.<br><br>b) Who would give them weapons?<br>Since there would be no state to attack and no state apparatus to immediately take over, the rogue agency would need to knock on everyone&#039;s door to demand the payment of their fraudulent services (taxation). They would encounter resistance movements and guerrilla warfare tactics used by their previous customers or other people.<br><br>c) And what would they do with other companies?<br>The other companies, in attempting to fulfill their promises as a property rights enforcer, would most certainly jump in and assist their own customers at fighting and ultimately destroying the rogue company. The would-be monopolist would after all be a massive insurance risk since they&#039;d have to destroy and expropriate massive amounts of property, thus raising crime and premiums.","time":1491677765,"resto":120161342,"id":"bqxDvl7c","country":"PT","country_name":"Portugal"},{"no":120167087,"now":"04\/08\/17(Sat)14:57:52","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120166601\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120166601<\/a><br>Because if you broke the contract you would be physically removed from the covenant by the violence of the security firm you signed you would be exposed to in said contract.","time":1491677872,"resto":120161342,"id":"e+vm1DIQ","country":"MT","country_name":"Malta"},{"no":120167143,"now":"04\/08\/17(Sat)14:58:22","name":"Anonymous","com":"Who are the best content producers putting right libertarian content currently?

They, for the most part, keep their old city spared from modern stuff.<\/span><br>Precisely because of that.<br>The refusal to modernize the city means the space remains limited due to restriction on building size and floors. So you have over a million people packing themselves into a far too limited space, hiking up the prices of any and all forms of housing, making larger roads impossible because all the available space is needed for housing, giving the town one of the highest population densities on the planet.<br>Paris is proof that if you want to have modern life, you need a modern city and can&#039;t bury your hand in the sand in the name of tradition and identity forever. It&#039;s proof that towns must adapt if they want to remain liveable in this day and age.","time":1492547113,"resto":121712788,"country":"FR","country_name":"France"},{"no":121734583,"now":"04\/18\/17(Tue)16:25:26","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121725374\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121725374<\/a><br>fuckin based Hungary","time":1492547126,"resto":121712788,"country":"SE","country_name":"Sweden"},{"no":121734619,"now":"04\/18\/17(Tue)16:25:37","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121734037\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121734037<\/a><br>I am 99% sure this is the inside of a guitar","time":1492547137,"resto":121712788,"country":"CA","country_name":"Canada"},{"no":121734669,"now":"04\/18\/17(Tue)16:25:58","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121734199\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121734199<\/a><br><br> You&#039;ll LOVE these, then.","filename":"ZigzagTowers_Doha_Qatar_w500","ext":".jpg","w":500,"h":335,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":83,"tim":1492547158072,"time":1492547158,"md5":"ECbOJyaS9pGLYIJTU26wdg==","fsize":26096,"resto":121712788,"country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":121734744,"now":"04\/18\/17(Tue)16:26:32","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121734669\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121734669<\/a><br>AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH IM SO DIZZY WTF","time":1492547192,"resto":121712788,"country":"AU","country_name":"Australia"},{"no":121734786,"now":"04\/18\/17(Tue)16:26:50","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121733799\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121733799<\/a><br>WTF?

You literally ride a fucking train (monorail) into the building, get dropped off, a bellhop takes your bags, and you go to your sweet ass room. Disney has amazing service across the board, it&#039;s why so many people go to their resorts over their amusement parks. They&#039;re one of the largest land owners in the world. I&#039;ll always go to a Disney resort if I can, simply because I know it will be insulated from the trash and I can do almost anything, and get almost anything. All while being completely informal, which is the biggest appeal IMO. I&#039;ve stayed at the Ritz in NYC and I felt like every dickhole and their mother was quietly checking everyone out trying to gauge how poor everyone else was. Meanwhile I can just go to a Disney hotel and get outstanding service and no judgement. <br><br><a href=\"#p121733732\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121733732<\/a><br><br>You&#039;re right, but it&#039;s like a combination of SF and NYC in terms of the beggars and migrants. And then you quickly lose the charm the city because you&#039;re constantly trying to avoid assholes attempting to scam you. I don&#039;t speak a lick of French, but I have a lot of family in France who are bilingual. One of them works for the UN. So when I go to Paris (which is where they live, well, that and Nice) and we&#039;re conversing in English people will automatically see you as a mark. I&#039;ve had guys try to upcharge on food and water before, only because they thought we were American. Then suddenly for my relatives to start berating the assholes in French for thinking they could try and trick a local.","time":1492547212,"resto":121712788,"country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":121734799,"now":"04\/18\/17(Tue)16:26:55","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121734619\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121734619<\/a><br>Holy shit of course","time":1492547215,"resto":121712788,"country":"US","country_name":"United States"}]}

Doctors Finally Treat Her Like One.","com":"<span class=\"quote\">&gt;NEW HAVEN \u2014 Hannah is a 14-year-old girl, clad in leggings and an oversize T-shirt, with long brown hair that she curls around a finger. She was also born a boy.<\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;The government can\u2019t seem to decide whether it should affirm children like Hannah. President Trump jumped from supporting workplace protections for transgender people to ending supportive policies for transgender students in public schools. The Supreme Court waffled on whether or not these kids can use the bathrooms of their identified genders, sending the question back to the Fourth Circuit. Last month, North Carolina repealed a law that forced transgender people to use the bathroom corresponding with the gender on their birth certificates, while strangely prohibiting schools from adopting policies that would let transgender students use the bathroom of their choice.<\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Politicians could learn something from the doctors who treat these patients. Over the past few years, it has become clear that if we support these children in their transgender identities instead of trying to change them, they thrive instead of struggling with anxiety and depression.<\/span><br><br>https:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/2017\/04\/08\/<wbr>opinion\/sunday\/hannah-is-a-girl-doc<wbr>tors-finally-treat-her-like-one.htm<wbr>l","filename":"Fact","ext":".jpg","w":404,"h":513,"tn_w":196,"tn_h":250,"tim":1493085828916,"time":1493085828,"md5":"VAWNc\/hdYQ2soLfPKaFhag==","fsize":80286,"resto":0,"id":"ZGfFMi0l","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"hannah-is-a-girl-doctors-finally-treat-her-like","country_name":"United States","replies":0,"images":0,"unique_ips":1}]}

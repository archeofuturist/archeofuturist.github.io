James, Duke of York, led two cavalry charges against the Cromwellian troops&#039; flank, driving into the musketeers. Some Spanish cavalry from their reserve was sent forward and threatened the English but were defeated in turn by the French cavalry under Marquis de Castelneau. The French infantry consisting of the Guards, the Swiss and the regiments of Picardy and Turenne advanced on the Spanish centre, meeting little resistance. Marshal Turenne took advantage of the receding tide to concentrate most of his cavalry on his left, and its advance enveloped the Spanish right wing.[21]","time":1491406162,"resto":119601405,"id":"M7Cq4udm","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":119616682,"now":"04\/05\/17(Wed)11:29:36","name":"Anonymous","filename":"1491399505292","ext":".jpg","w":1084,"h":625,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":72,"tim":1491406176440,"time":1491406176,"md5":"SzBfozkPOm9cPngyKfLfVA==","fsize":135360,"resto":119601405,"id":"ikwVFV8I","country":"GB","m_img":1,"country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":119616756,"now":"04\/05\/17(Wed)11:30:25","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119613259\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119613259<\/a><br>We always defeated the British when they invaded us but got btfo when we invaded them. <br><br>We will gladly provide nigg...refugees to dump by boat in the UK.","time":1491406225,"resto":119601405,"id":"TdTZV2QG","country":"AR","country_name":"Argentina"},{"no":119616772,"now":"04\/05\/17(Wed)11:30:34","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119616682\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119616682<\/a><br>Go do a vote. 99% will vote remain in uk.","time":1491406234,"resto":119601405,"id":"HuXA9Du0","country":"DZ","country_name":"Algeria"},{"no":119616820,"now":"04\/05\/17(Wed)11:31:05","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119616682\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119616682<\/a><br>Cute, but not white.

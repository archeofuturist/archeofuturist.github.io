Britain viewed the Negev as a strategic land bridge between Egypt and Transjordan that was vital to both British and Western interests in the Middle East, and were anxious to keep it from falling into Israeli hands. On 19 October 1948, Sir Alexander Cadogan, the British representative to the United Nations, pressed for sanctions against Israel. The British believed that it would be in their and the West&#039;s strategic interest if they maintained de facto control of a land bridge from Egypt to Transjordan, and Foreign Secretary Ernest Bevin tried to persuade the US government to support his position and force Israel to withdraw. In particular, Bevin hoped to restrict Israel&#039;s southern border to the Gaza-Jericho-Beersheba road. The British ambassador in Cairo, Sir Ronald Campbell, advocated military intervention against Israel to stop the IDF&#039;s drive into the Negev in a January 1949 cable to Bevin. However, the British diplomatic campaign failed to persuade the US government to take action against Israel, with US President Harry S. Truman referring to the Negev as &quot;a small area not worth differing over&quot;. Mounting international and domestic criticism forced an end to Britain&#039;s attempts to intervene in the war, and Bevin ordered British forces to stay clear of the Israelis in the Negev.[62][84]<br><br>jews jewing jews. british wanting daddy america to fight for them.<br><br>same story over and over. shed white american patriot blood fighting for stupid jew faggots in new york who owe allegiance to stupid jew faggots in london who are fighting over their share of the pie with their stupid jew faggots in Palestine(Israel)<br><br>America hates you Britain, it just needs to remember the cancer you are","time":1491412514,"resto":119601405,"id":"+s6Wy8l2","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":119628367,"now":"04\/05\/17(Wed)13:16:46","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119621204\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119621204<\/a><br>I&#039;ll be saving this, thank you","time":1491412606,"resto":119601405,"id":"eNntufgL","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":119628382,"now":"04\/05\/17(Wed)13:16:53","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119625872\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119625872<\/a><br>Same ones like the Brits had in Cartagena de las Indias","filename":"1491380150893","ext":".jpg","w":249,"h":250,"tn_w":124,"tn_h":125,"tim":1491412613279,"time":1491412613,"md5":"cMdkdoVORsm3L1DYgUavSg==","fsize":7245,"resto":119601405,"id":"ldR2DOHt","country":"ES","country_name":"Spain"},{"no":119628424,"now":"04\/05\/17(Wed)13:17:19","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119628212\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119628212<\/a><br>Who hurt you anon, did someone steal your lego collection?","time":1491412639,"resto":119601405,"id":"DRK98be\/","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":119628848,"now":"04\/05\/17(Wed)13:21:10","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119627961\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119627961<\/a><br>https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Const<wbr>itution_of_Sweden<br><br>the death of your country<br><br>The 1974 Instrument of Government (Swedish: Regeringsformen)<br><br>The 1991 Fundamental Law on Freedom of Expression (Swedish: Yttrandefrihetsgrundlagen)<br><br>read up, the connection is your royalties connection to the british royalty<br><br>we need a second revolution against britain to force them out once and for all<br><br>all british, israeli, etc agents should be driven out from the US as foreign combatants","time":1491412870,"resto":119601405,"id":"+s6Wy8l2","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":119628910,"now":"04\/05\/17(Wed)13:21:49","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119605972\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119605972<\/a><br>would love to see eu bomb itself lmao","time":1491412909,"resto":119601405,"id":"lGI1YkxW","country":"TR","country_name":"Turkey"},{"no":119628993,"now":"04\/05\/17(Wed)13:22:31","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119601405\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119601405<\/a><br>Nobody in England gives a fuck, the Spanish are always pulling this cheeky shit.

It was at this meeting that the International Banking Syndicate decided that (America) the North was to be pitted against the South under the old principle of &#039;divide and conquer.&#039; This amazing agreement was corroborated by MacKenzie in his historical research entitled &#039;The Nineteenth Century.&#039;&quot; (Committee to Restore the Constitution, Fort Collins, Colorado, January, 1976 Bulletin)<br><br> The plotters realized that once again the American people would not accept a national bank without a reason for having one, and once again the plotters decided upon a war. Wars are costly, and they force governments into a position where they must borrow money to pay for them, and the decision was made once again to force the United States into a war so that it would have to deal with the issue of how to pay for its costs.<br><br> But the plotters had a difficult problem: what nation could they induce to fight against the United States Government? The United States was too powerful, and no country, or combinations of countries, could match them in a &quot;balance of power&quot; showdown. Canada to the north and Mexico to the south were not strong enough and couldn&#039;t raise an army adequate for the anticipated conflict, so they were discounted. England and France were 3,000 miles away and across a huge ocean that made the supplying of an invading army nearly impossible. And Russia had no central bank so the bankers had no control over that nation. <br><br>your rothchilds. your sins.<br><br>americans would hang them from the highest pole and leave them.","time":1491413302,"resto":119601405,"id":"+s6Wy8l2","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":119629641,"now":"04\/05\/17(Wed)13:28:37","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119629442\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119629442<\/a><br>sad desu","filename":"1478555037025","ext":".jpg","w":1518,"h":952,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":78,"tim":1491413317535,"time":1491413317,"md5":"w9I6ztz3YmVYnfiv4A5xrQ==","fsize":178856,"resto":119601405,"id":"xq8VgEh8","country":"GB","m_img":1,"country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":119629830,"now":"04\/05\/17(Wed)13:29:59","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119615145\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119615145<\/a><br>Fuck Scotland, they are too socialist to be independent.","time":1491413399,"resto":119601405,"id":"b+1Kj4L1","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":119630150,"now":"04\/05\/17(Wed)13:32:42","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119629625\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119629625<\/a><br>https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Roths<wbr>child_banking_family_of_England<br><br>read that again<br><br>Rothschild Banking Family of England<br><br>you dont own us, your pervert masters try to<br><br>but we have weapons unlike you cucks and we wont stop till we stay free<br><br>God is with America while you squander your lives being mere chattel of a corrupt jewish monarchy<br><br>notice the lack of americans now defending you<br><br>its because they now see you for what you are","time":1491413562,"resto":119601405,"id":"+s6Wy8l2","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":119630383,"now":"04\/05\/17(Wed)13:34:47","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119601405\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119601405<\/a><br>Great naval charting software, with this nice blue arrow representing the ship!","time":1491413687,"resto":119601405,"id":"6IqrXMbZ","country":"NO","country_name":"Norway"},{"no":119630773,"now":"04\/05\/17(Wed)13:38:04","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119629229\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119629229<\/a><br><br>Gypsies are everywhere, like a plague.","filename":"1491321851240","ext":".jpg","w":693,"h":796,"tn_w":108,"tn_h":125,"tim":1491413884222,"time":1491413884,"md5":"WPobAVsS1Y4lLyG7DakwrQ==","fsize":55306,"resto":119601405,"id":"hER6FfCU","country":"ES","country_name":"Spain"},{"no":119631561,"now":"04\/05\/17(Wed)13:45:01","name":"Anonymous","com":"Una vez que s&#039;haya iniciado el art\u00edculo 50","time":1491414301,"resto":119601405,"id":"iiK\/yhZh","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":119631753,"now":"04\/05\/17(Wed)13:46:41","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119602023\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119602023<\/a><br>It&#039;s so obviously forced.

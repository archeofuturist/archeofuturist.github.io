Be honest.<br><br>If you answered yes, you need to hit up google right now and search &quot;how do we know that God is real&quot;, &quot;how do we know that the Bible is true&quot;, check out reasons to believe, answers in Genesis, and search youtube for Chuck Missler, Dr. Robert Carter, and Kent Hovind.<br><br>The bible has over 2000 very specific prophecies that have already come true. No other text comes even close. This all points to the fact that we are very close to the end. Every single one of you knows this deep down inside, but you deceive yourselves. You know that God is real, but you choose to rebel. It is in our nature. You need to admit that you need help and ask God for it. He will answer. He is reaching out to all of you, but you need to meet him halfway because he gave us free will.<br><br>I am a physicist and was an atheist for a long time. My journey began with me admitting to myself that I was agnostic. Next, I simply said &quot;God, i&#039;m not sure if you are real, but if you are, I want to follow you&quot;.

He further predicted that the Messiah would be &quot;cut off,&quot; killed, and that this event would take place prior to a second destruction of Jerusalem. Abundant documentation shows that these prophecies were perfectly fulfilled in the life (and crucifixion) of Jesus Christ. The decree regarding the restoration of Jerusalem was issued by Persia&#039;s King Artaxerxes to the Hebrew priest Ezra in 458 BC, 483 years later the ministry of Jesus Christ began in Galilee. (Remember that due to calendar changes, the date for the start of Christ&#039;s ministry is set by most historians at about AD 26. Also note that from 1 BC to AD 1 is just one year.) Jesus&#039; crucifixion occurred only a few years later, and about four decades later, in AD 70 came the destruction of Jerusalem by Titus.&quot;<br><br>A prediction down to the exact day.

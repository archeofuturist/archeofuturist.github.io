Be honest.<br><br>If you answered yes, you need to hit up google right now and search &quot;how do we know that God is real&quot;, &quot;how do we know that the Bible is true&quot;, check out reasons to believe, answers in Genesis, and search youtube for Chuck Missler, Dr. Robert Carter, and Kent Hovind.<br><br>The bible has over 2000 very specific prophecies that have already come true. No other text comes even close. This all points to the fact that we are very close to the end. Every single one of you knows this deep down inside, but you deceive yourselves. You know that God is real, but you choose to rebel. It is in our nature. You need to admit that you need help and ask God for it. He will answer. He is reaching out to all of you, but you need to meet him halfway because he gave us free will.<br><br>I am a physicist and was an atheist for a long time.

I felt pissed that instead of hiring competent workers regardless of gender, they chose the opposite only to appeal to feelings. What they don&#039;t understand is that men who work together are more tribal and look for the best for the best job. It&#039;s the hunters mindset. If we detect someone weak in the group, we are pissed because someone else could do the job better for the overall tribe. There&#039;s no &quot;threatened masculinity&quot; and if someone does feel like their masculinity is threatened, then they seriously lacking a manhood to begin with. I don&#039;t care anymore about the business I work for since it&#039;s pretty obvious it&#039;s no longer about the competitiveness of the overall business on your shoulders as it used to be and still is to small businesses. If I was being controlled by a female boss, I&#039;m not threatened. I feel undervalued if I can do a better job but not threatened. If she can do a better job then I do then I&#039;ll respect her. You can&#039;t command respect, you earn it.","time":1492970024,"resto":122454441,"id":"OcRuj7qO","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":122455953,"now":"04\/23\/17(Sun)13:55:56","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122454441\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122454441<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;online questionnaire <\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;scientific<\/span><br><br>jesus christ. jordan peterson was right when he said social psychology is a fucking joke.

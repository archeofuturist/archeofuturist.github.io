I do know who started the conflict and founded ISIS. The problem is keeping the narrative straight between the news and the fake news on this one. <br><br>The last time sarin gas was a concern was in Iraq when &quot;W&quot; wanted to kick Saddam&#039;s ass. Apparently, there were no &quot;WMDs&quot; per se, but there was shit tons of sarin gas; which we all know is potent and deadly. <br><br>AS WE INVADED IRAQ, there were news stories with video showing convoy after convoy of sarin gas shipments flooding into Syria. These were the WMDs, in essence, and the entire reason why we supposedly invaded Iraq from the start. <br><br>So, my take on it is: <br>A - The sarin gas story is playing on folks that remember this little fact from Iraq, making an invasion seem &quot;justifiable&quot; from a humanitarian standpoint (Oh; just like Iraq!)<br><br>B - The sarin gas story is a complete and utter lie, ISIS is actually responsible for all this nonsense, and someone, somewhere, really wants to &quot;Saddam&quot; the Assad. <br><br>The redpill lies in the &quot;why&quot; at the end of option &quot;B&quot;. The &quot;why&quot; is what we don&#039;t understand. In the meantime, hundreds of thousands of &quot;refugees&quot; are pouring into the Europe, supposedly from Syria.","filename":"syrian_refugees","ext":".png","w":1198,"h":814,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":84,"tim":1491397665124,"time":1491397665,"md5":"3kxrrZ2yo7i8Ib1KTWH4rQ==","fsize":2343304,"resto":119588288,"id":"SsoOn20M","country":"US","m_img":1,"country_name":"United States"},{"no":119604867,"now":"04\/05\/17(Wed)09:13:12","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119602280\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119602280<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;the Russians are using it as a permanent excuse for bombing all hospitals and schools, particularly when victims and eyewitnesses are testifying that fighters were not present.<\/span><br>Russians do that to their own what makes you think they will\/should afford foreigners that luxury","time":1491397992,"resto":119588288,"id":"FHEOZ+s6","country":"AU","country_name":"Australia"},{"no":119605183,"now":"04\/05\/17(Wed)09:17:12","name":"Anonymous","com":"Another false flag wheeled out because the Syrian government is winning.

Also it has a decent vapour pressure, with heat, or in the case of a binary shell, it would disperse just fine. Further Syria, both rebels, government, and even the Kurds have plenty of chemical weapons from the Iran-Irag war. It could still be a false flag, but I dont think it was completely fabricated.

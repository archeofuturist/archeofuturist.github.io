When elections were held in the Netherlands and Austria, inspired by Trump&#039;s victory, the altraits relaxed and stopped paying tribute to the swallowhead, followed by a series of heavy defeats of the right forces. This should not happen again in France! We need to urgently return Kek&#039;s favor, and this, given his inconstant, mysterious and dark nature, requires at least unceasing sacrifices. The magic of memes is a great power, one must not renounce it, neglect it.<br><br>What can the Russian-speaking announcement do? Something that can. In Russia, for example, according to a mysterious coincidence, noodle &quot;Macron&quot; is common, right now it can be found almost in every department store. It can be, for example, exposing ritual insults and praising Keck, sacrificing in fire. The emblem of the &quot;National Front&quot; is a flame, so with the help of sympathetic magic we can help Marin le Pen to overcome Macron, the main thing is to maximally conduct the ongoing rituals, imbue them with the magical energy of memes. I think the ideal plan of action is to take a few Korans, mix them with Macron noodles, expose hula and piss their feet, slander, hold rough, remember to sing the glory of Keku, and then burn. The process should be filmed on the camera, upload video, make content from it, and then maximize it. So we will win!<br><br>Glory to Keku! Viva victory!<br><br>Also, I praise Keck, creating pikchi, including pikrelite, Kek, who breathes the life-giving spirit of Nazism into the flames of the struggle that the National Front has now unfolded. I can do something else in such a monumental style, throw ideas. All for the sake of total war!<br><br>Propose and your plans for conducting a magical war with socialism, multiculturalism, Islam, all the left discourse. We now need coordination, enthusiasm, skills and divine attention more than ever.

He was still a young man when he wrote it, and not yet a philosopher. He was interested, however, in who they were, and how they philosophized. A few years later, after Dawn, though arguably in 1879, N considered himself a philosopher and he wrote as such. To understand what he thought himself to be, how he wrote, with what purpose, and most importantly HOW HE WANTED TO BE READ, you have to read PTAG. <br><br>In short, to know how to read Nietzsche, you have to know how Nietzsche read those he considered genuine philosophers. Read N in the same way N read Heraclitus or Anaximander...always with an eye to the personality. It&#039;s all that matters, he says. It&#039;s not the content of their philosophy, or rather, the content matters only insofar as it reveals something about the personality of the philosopher. <br><br>The personality of the philosopher is all that matters to N. It&#039;s the only thing that&#039;s important to culture at large, which is why he even wrote Ecce Homo, a book which serves as a sort of reader&#039;s guide to his other works, but which at every point refers the reader back to N&#039;s personality. <br><br>Basically read PTAG (in which N talks about all these genuinely philosophical personas) and then read Ecce Homo as a continuation of that work, i.e., one in which N talks about N as a genuinely philosophical persona.","time":1491024570,"resto":119146119,"id":"gclsp9yY","country":"US","country_name":"United States"}]}

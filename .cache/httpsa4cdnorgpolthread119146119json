Good thing is that the book that immediately follows TSZ, Beyond Good and Evil, says the same thing as TSZ, except differently. So, if you&#039;re confused about something in TSZ, turn to BGE.<br><br>This passage, for instance, clarifies what he means by overman. Note that there&#039;s two possible outcomes for Europe, according to N. You either get the last man, or those incomprehensible and great ones make use of the chaos and war that they are.

And, of course, this board is one of the only places you can come and vent your anger about &quot;the kikes&quot; consequence free. I think that is the only reason it exploded in usage.

Bannon more than nearly any other person in the administration was being smeared by the media on a mass scale, to the point of him entering everyday conversation for some (myself included, had a friend bring up what he said about south asians). Had Trump fired him it would have been seen as a victory for the media and the establishment by a lot of people. All the &quot;e-celebs&quot; with their audiences were really pushing the story, too.

Lots of raep and stuff. My granddad told me there were some russians who rolled up into his rural town, drunk, and just shot their MGs at buildings randomly (not killing anyone in this instance, but still).<br><br>Is that true? I was just wondering how much of this is just shit that happens in war, and how much is on the russians alone. Like were they actually more brutal than other occupying powers? Was it fueled by the fact that for most of the war it was Nazi Germany vs Soviet Russia? Or is it just the bleak reality of living in an occupied area and all the occupying powers had their crap on a somewhat equal level?<br><br>Thought you guys might know more","filename":"Russian-Stereotype-8-270x180","ext":".jpg","w":270,"h":180,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":166,"tim":1493163498666,"time":1493163498,"md5":"SYk3czhTWwAWuoCNKOffIA==","fsize":21387,"resto":0,"id":"0PGfjcYV","country":"AT","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"after-wwii-austria-was-occupied-by-russkis-and","country_name":"Austria","replies":8,"images":1,"unique_ips":6},{"no":122807742,"now":"04\/25\/17(Tue)19:39:56","name":"Anonymous","com":"tl;dr<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt; public perception is russians were savages as an occupying power,<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt; supposedly more than the americans \/ others<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt; i&#039;m wondering if there&#039;s stuff to back that up or if it&#039;s just a myth fueled by post war animosity and stereotypes<\/span>","filename":"maxresdefault","ext":".jpg","w":1920,"h":1080,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":70,"tim":1493163596831,"time":1493163596,"md5":"f5OK+L6Y7wDzUhOjL8QKAQ==","fsize":150084,"resto":122807525,"id":"0PGfjcYV","country":"AT","m_img":1,"country_name":"Austria"},{"no":122808173,"now":"04\/25\/17(Tue)19:43:17","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122807525\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122807525<\/a><br>from what i heard the first line russian troops that came through a town, were brutal. but the rear echelon guys were brutal and drunk the entire time. and with the drinking came unpredictability and a loss of unit cohesion. they wouldnt listen to their commanding officers or nco&#039;s not that it mattered because most of the time they were drunk also.<br>so i dont doubt this story is true. your grandpa have any other stories?","time":1493163797,"resto":122807525,"id":"1lzLs4c3","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":122809372,"now":"04\/25\/17(Tue)19:52:56","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122807525\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122807525<\/a><br><a href=\"#p122807742\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122807742<\/a><br>Russians were breaking back an armed assault not against their state, but their very populations.

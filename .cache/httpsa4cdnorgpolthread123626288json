I once saw this great meme from Sassy Socialist Memes that epitomized a really thoughtful criticism of economic rationalism.<\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;&quot;It was one of those &#039;funny because it&#039;s true&#039; moments.&quot;<\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;There is much dispute and criticism around the use of so-called dank memes in the political arena; some feel they are overbearingly layered with irony, or prone to re-appropriating theory out of context. On the flip side, as Myles points out, they make political theory digestible. Memes are also undeniably accessible and democratic: memers make content on their own terms, and in doing so seize &quot;the means of production.&quot;<\/span>","filename":"1440305529020","ext":".jpg","w":339,"h":481,"tn_w":88,"tn_h":125,"tim":1493652307014,"time":1493652307,"md5":"KX3t7Rr9Z45X8ssFfy4A\/Q==","fsize":54551,"resto":123626288,"id":"352v+apI","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":123632584,"now":"05\/01\/17(Mon)11:25:20","name":"Anonymous","filename":"1459269098417","ext":".jpg","w":886,"h":600,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":84,"tim":1493652320548,"time":1493652320,"md5":"vXo+SxzJuKVLWFGe7sw18g==","fsize":162313,"resto":123626288,"id":"C70FfMNC","country":"CA","country_name":"Canada"},{"no":123632611,"now":"05\/01\/17(Mon)11:25:37","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123626584\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123626584<\/a><br>Who the fuck saw this shit coming...","time":1493652337,"resto":123626288,"id":"mtaBp32m","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":123632651,"now":"05\/01\/17(Mon)11:25:59","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123626288\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123626288<\/a><br>Their meme magic game is weak","time":1493652359,"resto":123626288,"id":"JtgYHoYB","country":"CA","country_name":"Canada"},{"no":123632722,"now":"05\/01\/17(Mon)11:26:40","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123632562\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123632562<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;&quot;A lot of people don&#039;t have time to write a whole article or make a whole stand-up special really getting into the grit of political conversations,&quot;

writes Professor Marshall of Deakin University. &quot;They offer a sense of personal connection and a way to instantly show your interest in an issue from a slightly removed point of view.&quot;<\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;James*, 27, is an admin for Crunchy Continental Memes, a Leftist philosophy meme page. &quot;If there&#039;s a takeaway for young people or activists looking at our page, it&#039;s that that continental philosophy isn&#039;t just academic abstraction,&quot; he says. &quot;It can inform and reinforce leftist political practice in a really vital way.&quot;<\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;The whole thing does sometimes conflict with his worldview, though. &quot;The problem with being an admin is that you end up seeing other people less as individual comrades, and more as potential engagements with your content, so the &#039;average&#039; memer you see fades into an amorphous multitude whose only function is to reward your toil with precious likes.&quot;<\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Susie (not an admin) isn&#039;t worried about that. &quot;Tagging a mate in a meme helps ease into a chat, you know?&quot;

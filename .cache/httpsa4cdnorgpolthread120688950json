The United States military had their budgets slashed like crazy over the past few years. Trump has said he would do more to fix the budget but hasn&#039;t done anything yet, and has actually made an even bigger problem. All the money going into the military is barely even for maintenance. Most of the USMC is below 25% combat readiness, because of the lack of budget, most of that money is wasted on attempting to innovate and failing.<br>Speaking of budgets, consider the strike on the airbase in Syria: Each tomahawk missile costs approximately ~1.5 million dollars. We launched 59 (less than half actually made their strike, good job guys). That&#039;s $88,500,000 we spent on that one strike. 88.5 million dollars we could have spent on actual maintenance of the military already there. That said, the U.S. military is really not in a good condition.<br><br>Another problem is the troops already stationed in the middle east. There&#039;s frequently tours to and from the middle east, but most of the troops that were supposed to come home 1-2 months ago are staying, and are being told they are going to stay another month, maybe even longer. This is a deliberate buildup of troops. In reality, I don&#039;t expect them to come home any time soon. U.S. soldiers stationed in Bahrain, Kuwait, and Eastern Iraq have had the flights supposed to take them home &quot;break down&quot;, and now they may not even have a way back to the United States. This is either a thinly veiled buildup without telling anyone below a CO rank, or it just shows how poor of a state the military is currently in.<br><br>And let&#039;s not forget the actual tension between Syria and the United States. Since the strike on Syria, there has been a lot more that they&#039;re not telling the public. All bases in the middle east have been told to &quot;Be on guard&quot;, and more strikes are to be considered.

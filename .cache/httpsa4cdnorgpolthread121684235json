They&#039;re polling at about 11% right now. Last election they were almost at 14%. Leaving the EU was the biggest reason they were popular, a large number of their members and voters were ex Tories, now that we&#039;re leaving the EU many of them have gone back to the Tories. They&#039;re tougher on immigration so they&#039;ll probably still beat LibDems but it&#039;s completely irrelevant basically.<br><br><a href=\"#p121684313\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121684313<\/a><br>Not necessary, Tories are polling at ~46% that&#039;s why they&#039;ve called an election, to secure an even bigger majority than they currently have. 37% of the vote last election is only like 50.3% or some such it&#039;s an incredibly slight majority.

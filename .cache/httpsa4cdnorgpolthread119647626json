In the same period, 33% of the world\u2019s babies were born to Christians, only slightly higher than their 31% share of the global population.<br>That is set to change, owing to the relatively young age profile of Muslims and their higher fertility rates. Between 2030 and 2035, slightly more babies (225 million) will be born to Muslims than to Christians (224 million). Between 2055 and 2060, the gap is expected to widen to 6 million \u2013 232m births to Muslims, and 226m to Christians.<br><br>Meanwhile, deaths among Christians in Europe are far outstripping births. In Germany, between 2010 and 2015, there were an estimated 1.4m more deaths than births among Christians. Pew said the pattern was expected to continue across much of Europe in the decades ahead.<br><br>https:\/\/www.theguardian.com\/world\/2<wbr>017\/apr\/05\/muslim-population-overta<wbr>ke-christian-birthrate-20-years<br>They will even outbreed niggers .","time":1491422780,"resto":119647626,"id":"0Bv83m61","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":119648881,"now":"04\/05\/17(Wed)16:06:49","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119648371\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119648371<\/a><br>I&#039;ve got a friend who&#039;s a Christian.

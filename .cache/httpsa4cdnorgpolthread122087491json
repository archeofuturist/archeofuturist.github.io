But for a situation so remote and opaque, it\u2019s hard to know where to begin. OutRight Action International has one easy suggestion: Tag Chechnya\u2019s strong-man president on Instagram.<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;So OutRight is urging people to share pictures on the site expressing their condemnation of state-sponsored violence and tag Kadyrov to let him know the world is watching. &quot;We&#039;re in an age where leaders use social media, so we&#039;ve asked [actor] Alan Cumming to record a video, and we&#039;re asking other celebs to do them, and we&#039;re asking people to go on Instagram and post a picture or a video, and tag the Chechen leader,&quot; explained Maria Sj\u00f6din, Deputy Executive Director for the organization.<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;In addition to calling for selfies for social justice, OutRight has also drafted an open letter to the CEOs of oil companies Exxon, BP, and Shell. Each of these companies have official policies that tout support for their LGBTQ employees, and each has substantial business dealings with Russia. (Chechnya is part of the Russian Federation, and President Kadyrov is a close ally of Russian President Vladimir Putin.) Sj\u00f6din explains: &quot;As human rights organizations we&#039;re used to working with governments and the U.N., but as this may not be working, we want to explore all the options. Money talks. We&#039;re calling for the big oil companies take a stand, because they already do business with Russia and have connections with the Russian state, and they should use their influence to make the torture and killings stop.&quot; There&#039;s also an online petition you can sign to support the open letter.<\/span><br><br>CHECHNYA BLOW THE FUCK OUT<br>REPORTS ARE COMING OF RAINBOW FLAGS BEING FLOWN IN THE STREETS BY 200 LBS BEARDED MUSLIM CHECHEN ALL AROUND THE COUNTRY","filename":"0d5d6678cb[1]","ext":".png","w":616,"h":735,"tn_w":209,"tn_h":250,"tim":1492744338772,"time":1492744338,"md5":"C8N\/xz\/JTexVJvpEMmftwQ==","fsize":394996,"resto":0,"id":"7xLnhYII","country":"FR","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"when-faced-with-the-kind-of-brutality-currently","country_name":"France","replies":0,"images":0,"unique_ips":1}]}

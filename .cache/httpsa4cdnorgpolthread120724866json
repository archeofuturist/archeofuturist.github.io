Jesus\u2019 sword was never a literal one. In fact, when Peter took up a sword to defend Jesus in the Garden of Gethsemane, Jesus rebuked him and told him to put away his sword, &quot;for all who draw the sword will die by the sword\u201d (Matthew 26:52). Why then, did Jesus say, \u201cDo not suppose that I have come to bring peace to the earth. I did not come to bring peace, but a sword.\u201d What kind of sword did Jesus come to bring?<\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Among the names of Jesus Christ is that of Prince of Peace. Such verses as Isaiah 9:6, Luke 2:14, and John 14:27 make it clear that Jesus came to bring peace, but that peace is between the man and God. Those who reject God and the only way of salvation through Jesus (John 14:6) will find themselves perpetually at war with God. But those who come to Him in repentance will find themselves at peace with God. Because of Christ\u2019s sacrifice, we are restored to a relationship of peace with God (Romans 5:1).<\/span><br><br>More on that here: https:\/\/www.gotquestions.org\/Jesus-<wbr>sword.html<br><br><br><a href=\"#p120728354\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120728354<\/a><br>1\/2 next post","time":1491982156,"resto":120724866,"id":"3aLbbQ6H","country":"US","country_name":"United States"}]}

But in typical Tory fashion, her lies and meaningless soundbites will always win over the masses.","filename":"huivzsuovhnduoa","ext":".jpg","w":745,"h":570,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":191,"tim":1490846997820,"time":1490846997,"md5":"0MJe1SbyhbIH\/kiXDRwZxQ==","fsize":66577,"resto":0,"id":"ugwPY3c1","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"at-first-i-thought-you-trumpets-were-being","country_name":"United States","replies":6,"images":0,"unique_ips":3},{"no":118880745,"now":"03\/30\/17(Thu)00:11:35","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118880578\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118880578<\/a><br>kys","time":1490847095,"resto":118880578,"id":"\/GiLOGgI","country":"CA","country_name":"Canada"},{"no":118880813,"now":"03\/30\/17(Thu)00:12:08","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118880745\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118880745<\/a><br>a hundred fucking days in his presidency? i don&#039;t give a FUCK what he&#039;s accomplished. he&#039;s standing alone against the entire world. the small things he&#039;s done, whatever he gets done, i don&#039;t care. the fuck do i care if he&#039;s unable to overcome the entire old world fucking order? you stupid fucking faggot. you have no respect, no honor, you fucking cocksucker. you don&#039;t fucking know what the fuck is going on. you fucking born cuck. you don&#039;t know what the fuck america means. you wouldn&#039;t last five fucking minutes over here. fucking bitch. you&#039;re the reason the west is dying. fucking coward. fucking critic. fucking trump is in the arena, motherfucking fucking donald fucking trump is the fucking champion. don&#039;t you owe nato 300 billion? enjoy russian rule. i&#039;m sure their dicks will be kind to your mother.","time":1490847128,"resto":118880578,"id":"ugwPY3c1","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":118881066,"now":"03\/30\/17(Thu)00:14:25","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118880578\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118880578<\/a><br>Where can I sign up for shareblue?

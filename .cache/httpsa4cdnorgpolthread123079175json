The thing is, you have never done anything serious against us, we fought together for centuries, and until the Slovak uprising in 1848 and the magyarization a few decades after there was no bad blood between us. Also magyarization tends to be overblown, contemporary European powers did much worse to their minorities. Just ask the Bretons or the Occitans, if you can find any. I understand that your country is young, and nationalism tends to see enemies in other countries, but sometimes it&#039;s worth it to try to see things objectively. Many of our nationalists see the Austrians and the Habsburgs as the devil itself, while in truth they came to the throne rightfully, and most of the historical fuckups were more of the fault of our own nobility than the Habsburgs.","time":1493331021,"resto":123079175,"id":"V82EItLD","country":"HU","country_name":"Hungary"},{"no":123097782,"now":"04\/27\/17(Thu)18:10:45","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123079944\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123079944<\/a>","filename":"T+alberto+barbosa+_","ext":".png","w":265,"h":258,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":121,"tim":1493331045263,"time":1493331045,"md5":"u2W\/\/WWm9Wx20tYKYv6e1Q==","fsize":91954,"resto":123079175,"id":"VDQzcVjJ","country":"CA","country_name":"Canada"},{"no":123097820,"now":"04\/27\/17(Thu)18:11:01","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123097556\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123097556<\/a><br>Probably jews","time":1493331061,"resto":123079175,"id":"oiBezgyT","country":"SK","country_name":"Slovakia"},{"no":123097934,"now":"04\/27\/17(Thu)18:11:48","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123095865\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123095865<\/a><br>finaly. someone with an elemntary knownlege of our shared history.

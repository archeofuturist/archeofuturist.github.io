Problem is, they&#039;re threading on lands they don&#039;t belong on and they don&#039;t even have their full population in (since there&#039;s a fuckton of Jews abroad, we all know that here), meaning their &quot;colonialism&quot; is not even founded on the Casus Belli that is a war for new lands and to feed their people.<br><br>Jews are parasitic, greedy beings, working on globalist and ultranationalist fronts (meaning they&#039;re financing both sides, those fucking longnoses), that need to be put on a leash. They deserve to have a place to live in, but just barely; and since they&#039;re Jews, and bound by the Talmud to only belong to Israel, they need to get the fuck out of our countries, since they have no interest in preserving them.","time":1491016205,"resto":119129050,"id":"3FxNOBvw","country":"CA","country_name":"Canada"},{"no":119136710,"now":"03\/31\/17(Fri)23:10:58","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119129050\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119129050<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;he didn&#039;t clear the ghouls out for violating the NAP (Tenpenny wants them off his property and ghoul response is that the tower is no one&#039;s property)<\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;he didn&#039;t kill every single ghoul he came across to cleanse the wasteland of subhumans<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;he didn&#039;t turn Harkness over<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;he didn&#039;t cleanse the degenerate vampire lair<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;he didn&#039;t turn every dark skinned person he found in the waste into a slave<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;he didn&#039;t convince Amata leaving the vault was a bad idea<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;he didn&#039;t side with Eden and cleanse the wasteland of all subhumans<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;he didn&#039;t side with Ashur in the Pitt<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;he didn&#039;t nuke the Citadel and clear out the false brotherhood from the wastes<\/span><br>get out of my face","time":1491016258,"resto":119129050,"id":"TLJxoPa8","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":119136813,"now":"03\/31\/17(Fri)23:12:08","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119135734\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119135734<\/a><br>Nobody did...","time":1491016328,"resto":119129050,"id":"EFLjE9Ab","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":119136948,"now":"03\/31\/17(Fri)23:13:49","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119129050\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119129050<\/a><br>what pissed me off about the whole thing is if you killed the leader, the one who lead the killings you somehow lose Karma. <br><br>But yes that is how you do subtle red pilling and I love it.","time":1491016429,"resto":119129050,"id":"\/8e\/4X8H","country":"CA","country_name":"Canada"},{"no":119136956,"now":"03\/31\/17(Fri)23:13:54","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119136710\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119136710<\/a><br>The Enclave is the only way to preserve not only the American way of life, but also the Occidental civilization.<br><br>Muties need to fucking die, they&#039;re just sterile monsters that&#039;d die out without technlogy anyway.","time":1491016434,"resto":119129050,"id":"3FxNOBvw","country":"CA","country_name":"Canada"},{"no":119137088,"now":"03\/31\/17(Fri)23:15:22","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119136605\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119136605<\/a><br>Get fucked, we will own you when the fighting starts.","filename":"1474581682960","ext":".jpg","w":1087,"h":1442,"tn_w":94,"tn_h":125,"tim":1491016522215,"time":1491016522,"md5":"svHQTUnP84obYWuQO9MWBQ==","fsize":135801,"resto":119129050,"id":"yfX4N5VJ","country":"US","m_img":1,"country_name":"United States"},{"no":119137167,"now":"03\/31\/17(Fri)23:16:19","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119137088\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119137088<\/a><br>based double eight tells the truth.","filename":"0c1","ext":".png","w":680,"h":581,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":106,"tim":1491016579666,"time":1491016579,"md5":"UqcPXWJsDdGLY310xHU7lA==","fsize":74275,"resto":119129050,"id":"3FxNOBvw","country":"CA","country_name":"Canada"},{"no":119137189,"now":"03\/31\/17(Fri)23:16:33","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119137088\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119137088<\/a><br>Checked.

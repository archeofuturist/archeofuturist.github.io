She could have very easily have fallen back onto handouts by the government, but she had a pride in what she did and refused to and instead put in the hard work to get us through it, even in spite of the fact that my brother is disabled and she was my grandmothers&#039; primary carer. I&#039;m not sure how she did it desu. On the other hand I&#039;ve known mothers who just get pregnant with their flavour of the month boyfriend and pop out a kid right before their benefits and maternity payments stop for their last one so they don&#039;t have to work and have done this from their late teens up until their menopause stops them. Most of their kids tend to end up doing the same things their mothers do. It&#039;s wrong to catergorise them into the same category imo.","time":1490806818,"resto":118803026,"id":"Prdsey54","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":118806385,"now":"03\/29\/17(Wed)13:05:34","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118805842\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118805842<\/a><br>Your mother still made a bad decision though.

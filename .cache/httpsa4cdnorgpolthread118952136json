Asked to stop by officers, she \u201cstuck her phone in her cleavage so that it could carry on filming and asked us with a smile to come and get it\u201d.<\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;&quot;The officers left. \u201cGiven Ms Le Pen\u2019s attitude, it was impossible to proceed with the examination of the computer material,\u201d the report adds.&quot;<\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;&quot;Ms Le Pen, 48, is facing allegations that National Front staff were unlawfully placed on the European parliament payroll at a cost of \u20ac1.1 million. They were paid as assistants to National Front MEPs but worked for the party in Paris instead, investigators believe. One assistant did not even have the telephone number of the MEP for whom he was supposed to work, it is alleged.&quot;<\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;&quot;Critics claim the scandal undermines the Front\u2019s claims to be more honest than traditional parties, but it has had little impact on Ms Le Pen\u2019s popularity.&quot;<\/span>","filename":"charlemong]","ext":".jpg","w":917,"h":960,"tn_w":238,"tn_h":250,"tim":1490899760210,"time":1490899760,"md5":"6SbrcRCTGgh\/xMXNaGwwjg==","fsize":120656,"resto":0,"id":"rcB70rUc","country":"GB","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"madame-president","country_name":"United Kingdom","replies":1,"images":0,"unique_ips":2},{"no":118952641,"now":"03\/30\/17(Thu)14:54:01","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118952136\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118952136<\/a><br>Charlemadame","time":1490900041,"resto":118952136,"id":"SC3rR\/Db","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"}]}

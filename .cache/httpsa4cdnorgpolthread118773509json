Never bothered with his books on atheism, but I liked The Selfish Gene &amp; The Extended Phenotype.","filename":"dawkins-tweets","ext":".jpg","w":1500,"h":1581,"tn_w":118,"tn_h":125,"tim":1490785667723,"time":1490785667,"md5":"u6tylQlJXQGwwxM57zXgZA==","fsize":1490425,"resto":118773509,"id":"5twx5Oso","country":"AU","m_img":1,"country_name":"Australia"},{"no":118774331,"now":"03\/29\/17(Wed)07:08:18","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118773509\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118773509<\/a><br>I hope he has another stroke<br>he&#039;s a posh old fart, born and lived in a bubble","time":1490785698,"resto":118773509,"id":"4k6udGx+","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":118774631,"now":"03\/29\/17(Wed)07:12:33","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118773509\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118773509<\/a><br>dawkins is an intellectually light weighted egotist. <br>he&#039;s only anti brexit because thats what his image managers tell him will keep him relevant.<br><br>fucker should be campaigning to remove kebab","time":1490785953,"resto":118773509,"id":"KiBEOChP","country":"AU","country_name":"Australia"},{"no":118774738,"now":"03\/29\/17(Wed)07:14:22","name":"Anonymous","com":"I started going to church again after 10 years so fuck him.","time":1490786062,"resto":118773509,"id":"UdTR5qBk","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":118775043,"now":"03\/29\/17(Wed)07:18:53","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118774631\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118774631<\/a><br>He&#039;s anti-Brexit because he&#039;s in academia and European university&#039;s research is all interlinked with one and other with agreements based on the assumption that free movement, and other EU laws hold.

The alliances of the West continued into the formation of NATO and the EU are all products of globalism. White nationalism has become the reactionary ideology of those seeking to monopolize the benefits of globalism while ironically upending the very structures that created those benefits against the influx of non white citizens in the West, and non white countries being adopted into the structure. Globalism has proven itself to unbelievably beneficial to Western society and nationalism seeks to maintain those gains while at the same time destroying the pathways by which that sort of wealth can be created. It&#039;s short sighted, impotent, and will eventually lead to the ruin and the end of white solidarity. Either way, with globalism or without it, white solidarity and nationalism is a double-edged sword that contradicts it&#039;s own raison d&#039;etre.","filename":"globalism","ext":".jpg","w":745,"h":429,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":143,"tim":1490905521454,"time":1490905521,"md5":"b+Q604XXH4ni0eJzGdW9JQ==","fsize":24118,"resto":0,"id":"PfgFT3T+","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"globalism","country_name":"United States","replies":0,"images":0,"unique_ips":1}]}

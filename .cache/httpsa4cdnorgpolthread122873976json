Or is it completely hopeless, as they will avoid them anyway and have powerful capitalist organizations on their side who use their avoidance of the law to their own advantage?","filename":"ChinaManufacturing1","ext":".jpg","w":475,"h":324,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":170,"tim":1493206301495,"time":1493206301,"md5":"H2BulNF6huiZsByRIE+jbQ==","fsize":52758,"resto":0,"id":"YT7JuH9i","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"universalizing-international-law","country_name":"United States","replies":3,"images":0,"unique_ips":3},{"no":122875372,"now":"04\/26\/17(Wed)07:49:03","name":"Anonymous","com":"<span class=\"quote\">&gt;advocating for globalism and a one world government on \/pol\/<\/span><br>What did he mean by this?","time":1493207343,"resto":122873976,"id":"NAfPP4B5","country":"AU","country_name":"Australia"},{"no":122876139,"now":"04\/26\/17(Wed)07:57:53","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122875372\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122875372<\/a><br>Holding countries like China accountable to agreed upon international or even national rules like Copyright Law and environmental protection would actually cut into their profitability though and prevent them from becoming so powerful, which is a major driving force in globalization right now, along with comparative advantage of countries which ignore or don&#039;t have such labor and environmental rules.","time":1493207873,"resto":122873976,"id":"YT7JuH9i","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":122876626,"now":"04\/26\/17(Wed)08:04:33","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122873976\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122873976<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Is it even possible to enforce such laws against countries like China through economic or legal means with trade organizations?<\/span><br>It was before.

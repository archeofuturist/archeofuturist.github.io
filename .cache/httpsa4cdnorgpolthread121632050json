If the family member went weekly to church, repented alot every year then I wouldn&#039;t really hurt me. My grandfather died months ago but even for his old age he continued to go to church until the last day. I am almost sure that he is in heaven right now. Futherly I am now the only person going weekly to church and doing confessions. It really hurts not seeing your family members in heaven.

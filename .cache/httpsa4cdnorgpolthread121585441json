They got a dead wrong. But they did the best they could with the information that they had at the moment. He won by narrowest of margins in three swing states. It&#039;s a shame you keep lurking in the deepest darkest dungeons of the alt right. The nooks and crannies where conspiracy theories lay in truth. This is a dangerous place to spend most your time. Alex Jones pushing the narrative that Sandyhook was staged is one of the most frightening stories to enter the main stream. That&#039;s one of many. Where as now, the true and diligent journalist with credentials, facts and sources are now completely disregarded by you and others like you because you buy into that&#039;s","filename":"fuck off","ext":".gif","w":555,"h":302,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":136,"tim":1492464611287,"time":1492464611,"md5":"7K2CYIMbyftlItOJDwDfoQ==","fsize":2072865,"resto":0,"id":"VDqn5hGv","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"help-with-my-sjw-friend","country_name":"United States","replies":3,"images":0,"unique_ips":1},{"no":121585666,"now":"04\/17\/17(Mon)17:31:36","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121585441\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121585441<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;cont<\/span><br>it&#039;s just &quot;fake news&quot; The agenda the White House keeps spouting. You all seem to lack of ability to listen to reason and truth, discrediting the journalist of the media organizations by allowing the &quot;youtubers in mom&#039;s basement&quot; and the Alex Jones cronie spawns to have a platform, if you even want to call it that. I don&#039;t think these outlets are all are this way and I&#039;m not trying to blanket them all of them in this category, just to be clear. I believe there is are some shades of truth to what they are saying in some cases. We&#039;re at a place in history where the scholars and scientists are being pushed aside by brutes who lack the intellect, curiosity, and inability to listen to scientific facts or remember history. This administration and it&#039;s toxicity will continue to pollute and erode this democracy, paralleled is this erosion are the irreparable effects it will have on the environment. Now that the EPA has been gutted and Obama era regulations have been rolled back. So, you think he&#039;ll bring us peace and prosperity? If he continues to govern as he does he will bring us nothing but war and lead us into one of the darkest times this country has ever faced.","time":1492464696,"resto":121585441,"id":"VDqn5hGv","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":121585772,"now":"04\/17\/17(Mon)17:32:19","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121585666\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121585666<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;cont<\/span><br>His erratic and impulsive tendencies without strategy to think things through is nothing short of dangerous. Now as you can see he&#039;s flip flopping almost all of his campaign promises like NATO, Syria, Yellen and the china currency. All that a aside. If anything, this election woke us up and mobilized us like we&#039;ve never before seen. What&#039;s at stake is too grand, we&#039;re already seeing the damage of what&#039;s possibly to come. Your love for him makes me feel foul on the inside and makes my soul cringe. But I still love both of you dearly. My suggestion to you, if you haven&#039;t already been doing so, is to really get a well rounded appetite of information and facts as they come in, be at the alt right, be at the radical left and everything in between. But don&#039;t abandon our institutions and just listen to these YouTube loners. Read. The best of the best. I believe there are two narratives being pushed by both sides and we must seek a way to find the middle ground of truth. I&#039;m doing my best to read and watch everything from both sides and I&#039;m getting better at staying informed from the other side that I don&#039;t normally gravitate towards.

A new shoe just keeps on dropping every day with many of the revolving stories surrounding Russia. Let&#039;s see how it all turns out. And again, I could be wrong. And let us remember, none of us Washington insiders or diplomats deeply imbedded in the government who are getting stories first hand. We can only rely on the tools and resources of what we have as citizens to guide us. As far as character traits go, given what you have seen from this man and being astute enough to see how vile, inarticulate, crude, disrespectful, bigoted he is. You would be blind not to at least admit that. Those are undeniable and indisputable. He has given a voice to the to a rise to the anti-Semite and white nationalist who were waiting to pop their ugly heads up again.<br>As far as Le Pen goes... are you kidding? Her anti Semitic views isn&#039;t enough to repulse you? Her fathers disregard for the holocaust and calling it a footnote in history isn&#039;t appalling? Her desire to dismantle from the EU will cause a domino effect in Europe. Supporting the expression of religious beliefs in public by banning yamaka&#039;s and habibi&#039;s. How does this way of thinking in this day and age have merit? &quot;","time":1492464767,"resto":121585441,"id":"VDqn5hGv","country":"US","country_name":"United States"}]}

Even among those who abstained until at least age 20, 81% had had premarital sex by age 44. Among cohorts of women turning 15 between 1964 and 1993, at least 91% had had premarital sex by age 30. Among those turning 15 between 1954 and 1963, 82% had had premarital sex by age 30, and 88% had done so by age 44.<\/span><br><br>CONCLUSION:<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Almost all Americans have sex before marrying. These findings argue for education and interventions that provide the skills and information people need to protect themselves from unintended pregnancy and sexually transmitted diseases once they become sexually active, regardless of marital status.<\/span><br><br>https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pmc\/ar<wbr>ticles\/PMC1802108\/","filename":"elle-fanning-at-the-neon-demon-photocall-at-2016-cannes-film-festival-05-20-2016_1","ext":".jpg","w":1200,"h":1158,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":241,"tim":1491039453611,"time":1491039453,"md5":"QFHXf550LhwuwoSUUvQE6g==","fsize":148157,"resto":0,"id":"N3aD8Dyc","country":"GB","m_img":1,"bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"trends-in-premarital-sex-in-the-united-states","country_name":"United Kingdom","replies":12,"images":3,"unique_ips":12},{"no":119164589,"now":"04\/01\/17(Sat)05:45:12","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119164140\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119164140<\/a><br>As someone who is terrified of the idea of having sex, this scares the shit out of me.","time":1491039912,"resto":119164140,"id":"zb4HLUtn","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":119164699,"now":"04\/01\/17(Sat)05:46:54","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119164589\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119164589<\/a><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;&gt;&gt; \/reddit\/<\/span>","time":1491040014,"resto":119164140,"id":"6jmtO9cT","country":"AT","country_name":"Austria"},{"no":119164784,"now":"04\/01\/17(Sat)05:48:02","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119164140\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119164140<\/a><br>Marriage is dead.

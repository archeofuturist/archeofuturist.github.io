I know how fucked the environment is, and unlike the faggots that think otherwise on this board, Nature doesn&#039;t care about whatever socioeconomic system we use to manage ourselves with. The reality has always been that we live on a planet with very finite resources, it wasn&#039;t as evident before because the worlds population for 99 percent of human history has been less than 1 billion. We have massively overshot our global population, and will pay dearly. Technology is just a tool, it was never a fix for a delusional worldview of never ending abundance that most in the United States seem to have. <br><br>Western civilization has been kidding itself for a long time about what is sustainable, and it is a lesson that we will learn the hard way. EROI for fossil fuels is rapidly declining, and in a developed world that is still entirely reliant on them for every modern convenience, it&#039;s pretty obvious what is going to happen.

I do not undertake to promote welfare, for I propose to extend freedom. My aim is not to pass laws, but to repeal them. It is not to inaugurate new programs, but to cancel old ones that do violence to the Constitution or that have failed their purpose, or that impose on the people an unwarranted financial burden. I will not attempt to discover whether legislation is &quot;needed&#039;&#039; before I have first determined whether it is constitutionally permissible. And if I should later be attacked for neglecting my constituents &quot;interests,&#039;&#039; I shall reply that I was informed that their main interest is liberty and that in that cause I am doing the very best I can.\u201d - Barry Goldwater","time":1493448824,"resto":123303599,"id":"P2UiSys3","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":123307863,"now":"04\/29\/17(Sat)03:02:43","name":"Anonymous","com":"The old conservatives were based. They were eclipsed by the Cold War conservatives like William F(ucking) Buckley jr. who put big business and the global empire agenda ahead of the Republic and the interests of its citizens.

They are the biggest traitors to the Republic of all. <br><br>Now that we hate all these fake conservative idealouges as much as we hate the neoMarxist fake left, it&#039;s a good idea to look at the old conservatives again.

This is the inherent issue with not getting the support of your party.

There is literally nothing preventing the next President in office from asking to join the TPP, for instance. Especially since the shills in both parties support it. This glaring issue is the ultimate reason why Trump will have no lasting mark during his term(s), aside from maybe appointing Supreme Court justices.

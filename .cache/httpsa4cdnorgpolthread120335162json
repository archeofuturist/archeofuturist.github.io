America isn&#039;t controlled by Jews, we control the Jews and for nothing else except most of the Israelis were initially European culturally and therefore were more suitable as allies than the dune coons who will throw acid in their daughter&#039;s face. Obviously America should not let its policy be defined by Israeli interests, but a perceived correlation between what benefits Israel and what benefits America should not be grounds for sucking Russian dick and allowing them free reign in the Middle East. Russia is not our ally, we are a part of NATO which was created to combat them, their interests are opposed to our own as we are competing for non-renewable resources. Using this shill tactic of the Jewish bogey man to scare teens on an image board into abandoning the causes of their nation is something the stereotypical merchant would do.","time":1491771583,"resto":120335162,"country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":120335980,"now":"04\/09\/17(Sun)17:00:09","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120335162\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120335162<\/a><br>Daily reminder that Putin is a true fan friend of Israel<br>http:\/\/www.washingtoninstitute.org\/<wbr>policy-analysis\/view\/the-maturing-o<wbr>f-israeli-russian-relations<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt; Ariel Sharon, a Russian speaker who formed a close personal bond with Putin, in November 2003 called the Russian leader &quot;a true friend of Israel,&quot; as reported by TSG IntelBrief.

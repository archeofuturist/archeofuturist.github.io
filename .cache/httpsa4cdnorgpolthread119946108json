He&#039;d much rather present a situation where it seems that Trump is going against his wishes. He&#039;s continuing his propaganda to make it seem like he&#039;s against the bombing when he was the one behind it. This is more for the benefit of the people investigating the Trump Russia connection than anyone else. Assad isn&#039;t stupid enough to use chemical weapons, so then you have to ask, who is behind it? Does Trump really have a motive large enough to gas Syrians? Does he even have followers loyal enough to do it? The answer is no. The only ones who could have done this are the Russians.","time":1491572589,"resto":119946108,"id":"1yb9jt4q","country":"US","country_name":"United States"}]}

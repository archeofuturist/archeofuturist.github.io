And all of the anxious sighing, longing and hope of their hearts is directed to the time when some day they would like to deal with us heathen as they dealt with the heathen in Persia at <br>the time of Esther .... Oh how they love that book of Esther, which so nicely agrees with their bloodthirsty, revengeful and murderous desire and hope! The sun never did shine on a more bloodthirsty and revengeful people as they, who imagine to be the people of God, who desire to and think they must murder and crush <br>the heathen. And the foremost undertaking which they expect of their Messiah is that He should slay and murder the whole world with their sword. As they at first demonstrated against us Christians and would like to do so now, if they only could; have also tried it often and have been repeatedly struck on their snouts.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Therefore know, my dear Christians, that next to <br>the Devil you have no more bitter, more poisonous, more vehement an enemy than a real Jew who earnestly desires to be a Jew... In history, therefore, they are often <br>accused of poisoning wells, stealing children and mutilating them; as in Trent, Weiszensee, etc. Of course, they deny this. Be it so or not, however, I know full well that the full, ready will is not lacking with them if they could only transform it into deeds, in secret or openly. Know this for a certainty and act accordingly!&quot;","filename":"Portrait_of_Martin_Luther_as_an_Augustinian_Monk","ext":".jpg","w":170,"h":243,"tn_w":170,"tn_h":243,"tim":1492991147705,"time":1492991147,"md5":"yVbwl74FZRwGk3qZ1TJWUA==","fsize":10068,"resto":0,"id":"HZMXCFRH","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"best-anti-jew-quotes","country_name":"United States","replies":0,"images":0,"unique_ips":1}]}

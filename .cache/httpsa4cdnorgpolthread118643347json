My grandfather was a little kid during the war and lived in Glasgow. In about 1943, a lot of American soldiers were bivouacked in a public park and were not allowed to leave (they were getting ready to ship out).<br><br>Across the road from the park was a fish-and-chip shop (fish and chips being the only food that was not rationed). All the American soldiers were giving their money to local kids and getting the kids to go across to buy them fish and chips. But there was one soldier who only had a \u00a320 note - that was $100 in 1943 and probably about $500 today. He didn&#039;t want to give that to some kid who might steal it, so he watched the children and picked one who had been really reliable, always bringing back the food and the right change. That was my grandad.<br><br>The American soldier gave him the \u00a320 and sent him across the street to get the order. My grandfather was very proud to be trusted like this and was determined to do it all exactly right. He waited in the queue, got the fish and chips, got the correct change, went back across the road.....and the park was empty. The Americans had climbed on their trucks and shipped out while he had been in the shop.<br><br>Apparently he cried his eyes out over this because he didn&#039;t want the soldier to think that he&#039;d run off with the money. He never spent it. He kept it in a drawer until he died. I think my mother still has it somewhere.","filename":"british sniper","ext":".jpg","w":500,"h":496,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":124,"tim":1490709080835,"time":1490709080,"md5":"YPvnKZS14skedJlS1Vq8sg==","fsize":71948,"resto":118643347,"id":"7QtTTXPi","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":118650262,"now":"03\/28\/17(Tue)09:51:54","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118643347\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118643347<\/a><br>Sounds like a terrible human being<br><br>You are probably LARPing but still","time":1490709114,"resto":118643347,"id":"6ckLOI1s","country":"NO","country_name":"Norway"},{"no":118650265,"now":"03\/28\/17(Tue)09:51:55","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118643347\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118643347<\/a><br>Flew a Lancaster bomber.

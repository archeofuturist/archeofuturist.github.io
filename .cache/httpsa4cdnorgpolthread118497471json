I honestly dont have much of anything to add to the subject that has not been added before.<br><br>Let me put it to you this way, though. There is a short story by ray bradbury about this crew that lands their space ship on a newly discovered inhabited world. They came out to meet the inhabitants for the first time, and to the shock of the commander, the locals couldnt care less about these strange people and their weird vessel. The commander began talking to the inhabitants and they talked about a wonderful man that taught them truth, and healed them. The man said he had to go to other worlds and do likewise to new people. The captain of the ship became infuriated when he heard about this &quot;man&quot; and eventually bullied out of them where the &quot;man&quot; was to go to next. The captain in a mad rage boarded the vessel (crew stayed behind if I remember right) to search for this man.<br><br>At the end of the story you are told that the captain would arrive at the new world and would be a couple seconds late. He would get in his ship and travel again to the next world and then be a second late. To the next and this time a half second late on into infinity.<br><br>I butchered a wonderful story, but this story reminds me of the problems of reductionism and positivism. The universe is more than the sum of it&#039;s parts. It would take an infinite amount of time to explain everything about existence because existence is infinite. Even if you could explain everything that there is, you would fail in explaining it because the universe is more than the sum of it&#039;s parts.

And all of this was soberly and honestly considered to be for the good of the world since this child, to be reared and educated in the Garden, would exert a great influence for good over his father\u2019s people.<br><br>75:3.6 (841.6) It should again be emphasized that Serapatatia was altogether honest and wholly sincere in all that he proposed. He never once suspected that he was playing into the hands of Caligastia and Daligastia. Serapatatia was entirely loyal to the plan of building up a strong reserve of the violet race before attempting the world-wide upstepping of the confused peoples of Urantia. But this would require hundreds of years to consummate, and he was impatient; he wanted to see some immediate results \u2014 something in his own lifetime. He made it clear to Eve that Adam was oftentimes discouraged by the little that had been accomplished toward uplifting the world.<br><br>75:3.7 (841.7) For more than five years these plans were secretly matured. At last they had developed to the point where Eve consented to have a secret conference with Cano, the most brilliant mind and active leader of the near-by colony of friendly Nodites. Cano was very sympathetic with the Adamic regime; in fact, he was the sincere spiritual leader of those neighboring Nodites who favored friendly relations with the Garden.","time":1490625704,"resto":118497471,"id":"Rch9Mcyo","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":118518503,"now":"03\/27\/17(Mon)10:42:13","name":"Anonymous","com":"75:3.8 (842.1) The fateful meeting occurred during the twilight hours of the autumn evening, not far from the home of Adam.

Incomplete finites. This is the present status of the ascending creatures of the grand universe, the present status of Urantia mortals.

It pertains to universes from early physical beginnings up to, but not including, settlement in light and life. This level constitutes the present periphery of creative activity in time and space.

Maximum finites. This is the present status of all experiential creatures who have attained destiny \u2014 destiny as revealed within the scope of the present universe age. Even universes can attain to the maximum of status, both spiritually and physically. But the term \u201cmaximum\u201d is itself a relative term \u2014 maximum in relation to what? And that which is maximum, seemingly final, in the present universe age may be no more than a real beginning in terms of the ages to come. Some phases of Havona appear to be on the maximum order.<br><br>106:0.5 (1162.5) 3. Transcendentals. This superfinite level (antecedently) follows finite progression. It implies the prefinite genesis of finite beginnings and the postfinite significance of all apparent finite endings or destinies.

On a world such as Urantia it comes at the end of a planetary dispensation. Cessation of existence can be decreed at such times by co-ordinate action of all tribunals of jurisdiction, extending from the planetary council up through the courts of the Creator Son to the judgment tribunals of the Ancients of Days. The mandate of dissolution originates in the higher courts of the superuniverse following an unbroken confirmation of the indictment originating on the sphere of the wrongdoer\u2019s residence; and then, when sentence of extinction has been confirmed on high, the execution is by the direct act of those judges residential on, and operating from, the headquarters of the superuniverse.<br><br>2:3.4 (37.2) When this sentence is finally confirmed, the sin-identified being instantly becomes as though he had not been. There is no resurrection from such a fate; it is everlasting and eternal. The living energy factors of identity are resolved by the transformations of time and the metamorphoses of space into the cosmic potentials whence they once emerged. As for the personality of the iniquitous one, it is deprived of a continuing life vehicle by the creature\u2019s failure to make those choices and final decisions which would have assured eternal life. When the continued embrace of sin by the associated mind culminates in complete self-identification with iniquity, then upon the cessation of life, upon cosmic dissolution, such an isolated personality is absorbed into the oversoul of creation, becoming a part of the evolving experience of the Supreme Being. Never again does it appear as a personality; its identity becomes as though it had never been. In the case of an Adjuster-indwelt personality, the experiential spirit values survive in the reality of the continuing Adjuster.","time":1490626475,"resto":118497471,"id":"Rch9Mcyo","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":118519613,"now":"03\/27\/17(Mon)10:54:39","name":"Anonymous","com":"<span class=\"quote\">&gt;god isn&#039;t real<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;ultimate redpill<\/span><br>Not swallowing a blue pill is not the same thing as a red pill<br>The actual red pill is that god isn&#039;t real but you should pretend he is","time":1490626479,"resto":118497471,"id":"BKQX9Vha","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":118519670,"now":"03\/27\/17(Mon)10:55:14","name":"Anonymous","com":"GOD is real.

I honestly dont have much of anything to add to the subject that has not been added before.<br><br>Let me put it to you this way, though. There is a short story by ray bradbury about this crew that lands their space ship on a newly discovered inhabited world. They came out to meet the inhabitants for the first time, and to the shock of the commander, the locals couldnt care less about these strange people and their weird vessel. The commander began talking to the inhabitants and they talked about a wonderful man that taught them truth, and healed them. The man said he had to go to other worlds and do likewise to new people. The captain of the ship became infuriated when he heard about this &quot;man&quot; and eventually bullied out of them where the &quot;man&quot; was to go to next. The captain in a mad rage boarded the vessel (crew stayed behind if I remember right) to search for this man.<br><br>At the end of the story you are told that the captain would arrive at the new world and would be a couple seconds late. He would get in his ship and travel again to the next world and then be a second late. To the next and this time a half second late on into infinity.<br><br>I butchered a wonderful story, but this story reminds me of the problems of reductionism and positivism. The universe is more than the sum of it&#039;s parts. It would take an infinite amount of time to explain everything about existence because existence is infinite. Even if you could explain everything that there is, you would fail in explaining it because the universe is more than the sum of it&#039;s parts.

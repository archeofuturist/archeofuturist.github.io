AnCaps shouldn&#039;t even bother to respond to them. People who ask these questions have never read a single paragraph about what Anarcho-Capitalism is and what does it say. <br><br>This universe is finite. Resources are scarce. Humans need resources to survive. Conflicts appear when two or more people want to use the same resource at the same time in a mutually exclusive manner. Law serves to eliminate conflicts, to determine which of these people have a legitimate claim to use that resource. We must determine who has property over it. Property over something is achieved through first appropriation (taking something that never had an owner before) or through contract (the previous owner willingly decided to hand over his property to you). This is why theft is a crime, because the thief does not have a legitimate claim over the victim&#039;s property. The stolen cellphone already had an owner, and the owner didn&#039;t want to hand it over to the thief. Whenever you don&#039;t follow private property laws, you are following animal law, where things are decided by whoever is the strongest. There is a priori proof for private property, and thus does not depend on empirical proof. For example, the Pythagoras Theorem can be proven to be true through logical deduction. I do not need to back it up with examples of rectangle triangles that fit into the formula. The theorem was true before people discovered it. If you show me a rectangle triangle that does not fit into the theorem, it&#039;s the triangle that is wrong, not the formula. The same thing happens with private property. A couple examples of violations of private property that &quot;worked out just fine&quot; do not invalidate the private property laws. <br><br>Now stop being a taxed cuck.","filename":"Ancap_flag","ext":".png","w":450,"h":300,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":83,"tim":1491165866278,"time":1491165866,"md5":"62QyIWBLETqLeMTTGhDPlQ==","fsize":5342,"resto":119226952,"id":"GK\/gWH9w","country":"BR","country_name":"Brazil"},{"no":119243784,"now":"04\/02\/17(Sun)16:46:11","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119228604\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119228604<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;doesn&#039;t understand the difference between choosing to enter into contracts voluntarily vs. being forced under threat of force<\/span>","time":1491165971,"resto":119226952,"id":"f4GPK8nf","country":"SE","country_name":"Sweden"},{"no":119243944,"now":"04\/02\/17(Sun)16:47:38","name":"Anonymous","com":"If you are not an ancap or at least libertarian you are the biggest cuck and literally too stupid to think for yourself and should probably kys.<br><br>Every single fucking &#039;argument&#039; against ancap is either a strawman or simply someone being too retarded to think about solutions for one second.<br><br>Fuck you","time":1491166058,"resto":119226952,"id":"9RPiah2X","country":"DE","country_name":"Germany"},{"no":119244033,"now":"04\/02\/17(Sun)16:48:27","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119228604\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119228604<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;company so big they can offer services cheaper than competition<\/span><br>only that&#039;s not how it works.

You fucking idiot. It does not need to be &quot;tried&quot;, ever. It already exists everywhere at all times. What changes is how much people interfere and clamp down on anarchy. Some places allow anarchy to run more freely, other places put up all sorts of barriers. Not even North Korea has managed to control 100% of human action. Even in a totalitarian nightmare, people are still the sole owners of their first property: their bodies; even thou their labor is stolen and his horizon of action is severely limited due to threats of deadly force being used against him. <br><br>The second biggest proof that AnCap threads contain no debates and are just a fancy classroom of Anarchy 101 is that people still ask about how things would work.

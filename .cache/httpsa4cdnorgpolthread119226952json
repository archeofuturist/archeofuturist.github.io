AnCaps shouldn&#039;t even bother to respond to them. People who ask these questions have never read a single paragraph about what Anarcho-Capitalism is and what does it say. <br><br>This universe is finite. Resources are scarce. Humans need resources to survive. Conflicts appear when two or more people want to use the same resource at the same time in a mutually exclusive manner. Law serves to eliminate conflicts, to determine which of these people have a legitimate claim to use that resource. We must determine who has property over it. Property over something is achieved through first appropriation (taking something that never had an owner before) or through contract (the previous owner willingly decided to hand over his property to you). This is why theft is a crime, because the thief does not have a legitimate claim over the victim&#039;s property. The stolen cellphone already had an owner, and the owner didn&#039;t want to hand it over to the thief. Whenever you don&#039;t follow private property laws, you are following animal law, where things are decided by whoever is the strongest. There is a priori proof for private property, and thus does not depend on empirical proof. For example, the Pythagoras Theorem can be proven to be true through logical deduction. I do not need to back it up with examples of rectangle triangles that fit into the formula. The theorem was true before people discovered it. If you show me a rectangle triangle that does not fit into the theorem, it&#039;s the triangle that is wrong, not the formula. The same thing happens with private property. A couple examples of violations of private property that &quot;worked out just fine&quot; do not invalidate the private property laws. <br><br>Now stop being a taxed cuck.","filename":"Ancap_flag","ext":".png","w":450,"h":300,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":83,"tim":1491165866278,"time":1491165866,"md5":"62QyIWBLETqLeMTTGhDPlQ==","fsize":5342,"resto":119226952,"id":"GK\/gWH9w","country":"BR","country_name":"Brazil"}]}

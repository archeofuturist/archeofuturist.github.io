If nothing else, production can&#039;t perfectly track demand because demand forecasting is imperfect and there&#039;s a lag time between market signals and the production response to it. <br><br>Even if your own example, you have too many goods because your demand forecasting failed and you have to notice something isn&#039;t selling before you stop stocking it. What happens to the unsold goods? Even storing excess goods has a cost associated with it. If it&#039;s not profitable to store the goods (ie it&#039;s taking up room that could be used for goods that are more profitable), the excess will still get thrown out.","time":1493577766,"resto":123503275,"id":"7c8dzQxE","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":123508816,"now":"04\/30\/17(Sun)14:43:38","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123507920\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123507920<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;die<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;live<\/span><br><br>Your people are communist Canada","filename":"coming 4 u mr reddit","ext":".png","w":1453,"h":817,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":70,"tim":1493577818663,"time":1493577818,"md5":"9Dwr2vpIOi\/TeVBzQ+Qfkg==","fsize":1824596,"resto":123503275,"id":"Zu39Gr4L","country":"US","m_img":1,"country_name":"United States"}]}

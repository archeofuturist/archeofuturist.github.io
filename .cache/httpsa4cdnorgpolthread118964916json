Leaders around the world fly to the world\u2019s largest building, The Great Trump Tower in New York City, to pay their respects. The great glass tower, designed by his son Eric Trump was completed on the site of the former United Nations Building, to serve as the headquarters of the third Bank of the United States after President Trump dismantled the Federal Reserve as his final act in office in January 2025.<br>His son, Barron Trump, now in his early 40\u2019s stands at the podium to greet the many sobbing faces. As 5 Star General of the American Cyber Command, formed by his father as the new branch of the military to face a new millennium, Barron is expected to pick up his father, and his sisters legacy as the third Trump in office at the next election.<br>\u201cWhen my father took office, barely 30 years ago, he swore and oath to protect and serve this country. The fake news media of the day, said he had no path to 270 electoral votes and that there was no chance for him to win. If only we had known then, what corruption that the treasonous viper Obama had sown amongst his vile swamp in Washington.\u201d","time":1490906388,"resto":118964916,"id":"XPh7o2p9","country":"CA","country_name":"Canada"},{"no":118965300,"now":"03\/30\/17(Thu)16:40:07","name":"Anonymous","filename":"cac03b_6132849","ext":".jpg","w":1327,"h":387,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":36,"tim":1490906407807,"time":1490906407,"md5":"v1pN5my+t03\/kz01Iez7eg==","fsize":89357,"resto":118964916,"id":"9ayfhboI","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":118965541,"now":"03\/30\/17(Thu)16:41:52","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118965300\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118965300<\/a><br>Can you please fetch the pasta?","time":1490906512,"resto":118964916,"id":"XPh7o2p9","country":"CA","country_name":"Canada"},{"no":118965779,"now":"03\/30\/17(Thu)16:43:48","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118965261\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118965261<\/a><br>\u201cFortunately for America, his movement \u2026 to Make America Great Again \u2026 could not be stopped. Within the first few months, the traitors were dealt with, and America had to face a grave scenario, a trial of a former American President, Barack Hussein Obama, with a punishment of death for his treason. Although my father hated Obama for what he did to this country, the mental illness we now know as betaphilism was rampant throughout America. He knew he needed a justice, a social justice to heal the nation. Although Obama admitted his guilt, that he had acted seditiously with the aid of a shadow government to distort the election and take down the office of President Trump, my father pardoned the traitor. The country was united as Obama was banished to his birth country of Kenya\u201d \u201cThat was a proud day for my father, but as we all know now, it was just the beginning of our new Great America. Although his first two years were difficult to get his legislation passed, due to a failing congress, the new MAGA party filled congress in the midterm elections, and with both a super majority in the House and the Senate what are now known as the \u201cGreat American Decade\u201d had begun.\u201d<br>\u201cMy father released deep state secrets that changed the world forever. Hidden cures for cancer and the secrets of zero-point energy that had been suppressed by the Clinton, Bush and Obama presidencies changed the face of the planet. Healthcare no longer became an issue, as all the diseases and sickness of the world were eradicated. The corrupt religion of Islam collapsed and state sponsored terrorism was eviscerated as the nation\u2019s formerly known as Saudi Arabia, Iran, and the OPEC cartel collapsed as oil became worthless in a new free energy society. \u201c Barron lifted his golden handkerchief from his pocket to wipe the tears from his face.

This old gentleman, he had to be in his 60\u2019s had this beautiful red hat. I thought my father made them as a joke. What presidential candidate wears a red trucker hat? He screamed at my father, \u201cLOCK HER UP\u201d. I spent that night browsing the web, and quickly realized how we could win this election. I told my father that I couldn\u2019t tour with him, that I had to meme. I shopped that damn hat on a couple frogs, you guys now know him as Pepe, the great symbol of peace. I joined hundreds of thousand other meme warriors to do something that had never been done before. We won an election, took down the corrupt establishment, with the internet. It was hard to describe what that felt like, it was hard to understand what this meant for the world. That a few \u201cPedes\u201d as we were called, could take down the Clinton Cartel, which was later discovered to the the largest money laundering and child trafficking organization in history, by actually becoming the News.\u201d","time":1490906935,"resto":118964916,"id":"XPh7o2p9","country":"CA","country_name":"Canada"},{"no":118967495,"now":"03\/30\/17(Thu)16:56:55","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118964916\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118964916<\/a><br>Muslim here, with a message for all the cumskins on this board: <br><br>It was you who divided up the land.<br><br>It was you who put in the puppet governments.<br><br>It was you who built the oil wells on Muslim holy lands.<br><br>It was you who allowed the Jews to exterminate and enslave the Palestinians.<br><br>It was you who played geopolitical games with Iraq and Iran during their war.<br><br>It was you who gave Saddam chemical weapons.<br><br>It was you who caused the Ayatollah to come into power in Iran.<br><br>It was you who created the Mujaheddin, Osama Bin Laden, and Al Qaeda.<br><br>It was you who killed 1 million children with your economic sanctions on Iraq.<br><br>It was you who, with your gluttonous oil consumption, gave power to Saudi Arabia and turned a blind eye to their funding of Wahhabi extremism.<br><br>It was you who abused the Arab world so much that they felt they had to attack your soil on 9\/11.<br><br>It was you who started an endless massacre across all of Afghanistan in retaliation against a small group that lived there.<br><br>It was you who invaded Iraq unprovoked, destroyed it&#039;s infrastructure, massacred it&#039;s people, and left it in shambles in your wake.<br><br>It was you who covertly ignited civil wars in Libya and Syria because it suited your geopolitical interests, only to let the bloodbaths stagnate when your goals failed.<br><br>It was you who not only caused ISIS to exist, but allowed them to grow like a cancer unchecked.<br><br>It was jouz who destroyed the lives of millions of Arabs and forced them to leave their homeland.<br><br>You are the cause of all of this.

We had a few setbacks\u2026 we all know what happened to California when their state went bankrupt and starved itself of food and water, causing it to be split into 5 states as a condition of its federal rescue. But we had so many victories.\u201d<br>\u201cMy father\u2019s stern policies on China caused their country to collapse, resulting in a cultural revolution that lifted the shackles of communist government from their shoulders, freeing them to become the great bastions of freedom and rich triple countries of China, Tibet, and New Taiwan that they are today.\u201d \u201cWe also united with our great friends Russia, to build a great space partnership that put both of our nations flags on the moon again within my father\u2019s first term. It is amazing that those early steps of partnership have led to what is now a population of 200,000 on our great New Washington city on the moon. Even the Trump-Putin bridge is one of the most beautiful architectural and engineering achievements ever built at its time as our nations united, with American Steel, to build a beautiful connection across the Bering Straits as part of my father\u2019s Third Infrastructure Bill in the Great American decade.","time":1490908102,"resto":118964916,"id":"XPh7o2p9","country":"CA","country_name":"Canada"},{"no":118969338,"now":"03\/30\/17(Thu)17:11:30","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118964916\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118964916<\/a><br>Not gonna lie, former Trump supporter here.","time":1490908290,"resto":118964916,"id":"P9rz\/Xbq","country":"US","country_name":"United States"}]}

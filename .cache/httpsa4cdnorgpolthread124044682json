The monarch&#039;s title is &quot;King&quot; (male) or &quot;Queen&quot; (female). The current monarch and head of state, Queen Elizabeth II, ascended the throne on the death of her father, King George VI, on 6 February 1952.<br>The monarch and his or her immediate family undertake various official, ceremonial, diplomatic and representational duties. As the monarchy is constitutional, the monarch is limited to non-partisan functions such as bestowing honours and appointing the Prime Minister. The monarch is, by tradition, commander-in-chief of the British Armed Forces. Though the ultimate formal executive authority over the government of the United Kingdom is still by and through the monarch&#039;s royal prerogative, these powers may only be used according to laws enacted in Parliament and, in practice, within the constraints of convention and precedent.","time":1493892165,"resto":124044682,"id":"9hwIcVBU","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":124045112,"now":"05\/04\/17(Thu)06:04:52","name":"Anonymous","com":"I STOOD UP ALL NIGHT FOR THIS?! <br><br>FUCK THESE CUNTS. <br><br>GAS THE WINDSORS, ROYAL WAR NOW! <br><br>All hail His Majesty, The Right Heir, His Kingship, King Burger of Colorado!","filename":"SmartSelectImage_20170504004751","ext":".png","w":1429,"h":2270,"tn_w":78,"tn_h":125,"tim":1493892292122,"time":1493892292,"md5":"VSM9FoNbmQGrG4HYeJHDxw==","fsize":1291498,"resto":124044682,"id":"JkPlPRK3","country":"US","m_img":1,"country_name":"United States"},{"no":124045242,"now":"05\/04\/17(Thu)06:06:55","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p124045112\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;124045112<\/a><br>U just got TRICKED!<br><a href=\"#p124044682\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;124044682<\/a><br>What did the Tsar ever do?

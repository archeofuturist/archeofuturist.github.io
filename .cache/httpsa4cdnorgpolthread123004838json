I am a graphic designer by trade, but also fully redpilled on holohoax, hitler did nothing, feminism, degeneracy etc.<br><br>I have watched Hitler speeches or two and been inspired of his amazing public speaking skills, but also found that in our movement, we have a great lack of inspiring public speakers. <br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Jared Taylor: some of the most desirable talking points we should convey in the current year and informative, but too dry, more like a college lecture than a ralling cry.<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Dicky Spencer: knows how to attract attention, makes bold claims, but comes off as too wishy washy and loves to cater to all these meaningless PR-building exercises (hurrdurr israel is a good model for a white ethnostate, homosexuality is okay, east asians are cool too) more than offering realistic solutions.<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Milo: youthful, keeps people fully focused on what he has to say, entertaining, drops some subtle redpills on complete normies but got his reputation crashed with the pedophilia accusation and goes for the &quot;I am the real liberal, progressives are more racist\/sexist\/homophobic than I do&quot; route that undoes his use of being an asset to a \/pol\/-tier movement<\/span><br><br>Basically, my question is, how does one acquire or hone public speaking skills? How to enter right-wing politics? I don&#039;t have plans to become an open holocaust denier or entering some national socialist group (in other words, to commit social suicide) but I would like to take at least one redpill and bring this into right-wing politics as I go forth, and possibly become a public speaker myself, since I am not particularly afraid of stage fright (been speaking up in front of class in different schools and done well enough).

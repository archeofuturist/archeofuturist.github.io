Like empty luxury high rises or further inflating The bubble economy....<br><br>Then we can put massive hidden tax increases on the middle class to fund this governmental largesse in the form of monetary policy, insurance, the destruction of regulation and oversite in required market sectors like healthcare.<br><br>Then we will force then we will radically increase the price for certain inellastic commodities by forced participation coupled with governntal subsidation like health care and higher education further restricting The asset accumulation and purchasing power of the middle class....<br><br>Then we can all wonder why the economy isn&#039;t working and why inneficient allocation of capital is so prevalent. And make make work programs like burying money in mines or raising the middle wage which ironically is exactly the same as building empty high rises... <br><br>Capital in a capitalistic economy seeks its most efficient allocation. Our capital is predominantly going to service the rich with useless production ergo we no longer live in a capitalist society.<br><br>The solution is higher taxation on the rich and asset class (wealth transfer to the poor), ending subsidizing of sectors or at least allowing for better capitalist controls like bargaining power, regulation, open markets, and bankruptcy for student loans, or efficiently allocating the capital in meaningful production (like China), or allowing the market to correct via collapse and correction. . .<br><br>But I for one look forward to our interminable economic malaise.","time":1493817285,"resto":123900333,"id":"sdCWKvm9","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":123911147,"now":"05\/03\/17(Wed)09:18:27","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123910512\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123910512<\/a><br>What?

You legitimately don&#039;t buy that a centralized authority can&#039;t make economic decisions on a personal basis, take into account every individuals budget and wants\/needs and control it intelligently for millions of people?

The fact that the vast majority of economic decisions are made by sovereign individuals on their own behalf every single day in the market is empirical PROOF that it works and needs no central planning. The best part is that when they mis-allocate resources they take a loss and learn from it as individuals, central planners just blame animal spirits in the economy and never pay for the damage they create, in fact people like you fancy themselves in their position and so they get praise literally no MATTER what they do. <br><br>And you&#039;re right, his writings definitely count as a source material for what NOT to do economically.

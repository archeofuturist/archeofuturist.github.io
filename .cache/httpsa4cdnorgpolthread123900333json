Look at every depression or recession of the 20th century and there&#039;s always a boom before it. Government spending and low interest rates sow the seeds for malinvestment that rears it&#039;s ugly head in the boom, but you don&#039;t feel it because asset prices are rising. Just like in the housing market. Everybody thinks it&#039;s all hunky dory until reality hits and the whole system comes crashing down all around us. Spending arbitrarily for the sake of getting the economy moving in arbitrary directions is not actual growth, and it always takes a painful redirection to re-allocate resources appropriately. <br><br>Plus there&#039;s the whole broken window fallacy thing. If you throw a rock at a window and hire a repairman to fix it, you get to go &quot;hey look I&#039;ve stimulated economic growth!&quot; however, all you&#039;ve really done is re-allocated resources from something ACTUALLY productive.

Using methods similar to those police have developed to solve crimes, British scientists, assisted by Israeli archeologists, have re-created what they believe is the most accurate image of the most famous face in human history.<\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Matthew&#039;s description of the events in Gethsemane offers an obvious clue to the face of Jesus. It is clear that his features were typical of Galilean Semites of his era. And so the first step for Neave and his research team was to acquire skulls from near Jerusalem, the region where Jesus lived and preached. Semite skulls of this type had previously been found by Israeli archeology experts, who shared them with Neave.<\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;With three well-preserved specimens from the time of Jesus in hand, Neave used computerized tomography to create X-ray &quot;slices&quot; of the skulls, thus revealing minute details about each one&#039;s structure. Special computer programs then evaluated reams of information about known measurements of the thickness of soft tissue at key areas on human faces. This made it possible to re-create the muscles and skin overlying a representative Semite skull.<\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;The entire process was accomplished using software that verified the results with anthropological data. From this data, the researchers built a digital 3D reconstruction of the face. Next, they created a cast of the skull.<\/span><br><br>http:\/\/www.popularmechanics.com\/sci<wbr>ence\/health\/a234\/1282186\/","filename":"gallery-1450102902-screen-shot-2015-12-14-at-91810-am","ext":".png","w":640,"h":837,"tn_w":191,"tn_h":250,"tim":1492514571275,"time":1492514571,"md5":"Q3mGTrFdS4fer5OOiBiksA==","fsize":947003,"resto":0,"id":"jISj9BX6","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"happy-easter-pol-this-is-the-real-face-of-your","country_name":"United States","replies":1,"images":0,"unique_ips":2},{"no":121673226,"now":"04\/18\/17(Tue)07:29:05","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121672539\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121672539<\/a><br>even if, whats the deal ?","time":1492514945,"resto":121672539,"id":"s5Gl3TsB","country":"DE","country_name":"Germany"}]}

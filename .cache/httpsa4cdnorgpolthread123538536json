You&#039;re completely surrounded by missileer ships whose sole task is to you alive. You have submarines escorting you from below. You have AWACS planes and fighter jets circling all around to detect income threats. <br><br>Compare that to a stationary land-based airfield which completely lacks those defenses. In a war, land-based airfields will be targeted and destroyed by long-range missiles during the opening moves of a conflict. Whereas the carrier is immune to long-range missiles by the simple virtue of being a moving target. Combine that with all the escorting warships and you&#039;ve got one tough nut to crack.","filename":"1445015848043","ext":".jpg","w":4288,"h":2848,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":83,"tim":1493598243594,"time":1493598243,"md5":"KQGefBDvJLFiROXs+5fUJw==","fsize":775768,"resto":123538536,"id":"gqbYmdVQ","country":"US","m_img":1,"country_name":"United States"},{"no":123550716,"now":"04\/30\/17(Sun)20:26:43","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123544002\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123544002<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Implying we have formidable enemies<\/span>","time":1493598403,"resto":123538536,"id":"bNArXVqQ","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":123550827,"now":"04\/30\/17(Sun)20:27:45","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123544533\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123544533<\/a>","filename":"image","ext":".jpg","w":1024,"h":791,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":96,"tim":1493598465619,"time":1493598465,"md5":"VTOWXfzo9FAFcyD48tOUhA==","fsize":157420,"resto":123538536,"id":"5SBzEU+t","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":123550839,"now":"04\/30\/17(Sun)20:27:49","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123549965\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123549965<\/a><br>Nanotubes were replaced by Hazar refugees holding on to the feet of the guy above.<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;They never age past 16 and you just have to show a pic of free gibs and blonde girls walking alone at bad hours in orbit and they will get up there.<\/span>","time":1493598469,"resto":123538536,"id":"Ip1ZAbsW","country":"SE","country_name":"Sweden"},{"no":123550893,"now":"04\/30\/17(Sun)20:28:18","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123549495\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123549495<\/a><br>Check the links, kid.

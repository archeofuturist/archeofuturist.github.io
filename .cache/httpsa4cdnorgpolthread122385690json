That the education system promotes and favours women in higher education through various Equality and equal opportunity programs, making it easier for women to get in to college\/university.<br><br>Argued regarding conscription that if she was so concerned about equality, either both men and women should equally be given a choice to enrol in wartimes, or that both genders should be forcefully conscripted for things to be equal.<br><br>She gets triggered so fucking hard. goes on massive feminist rant.<br><br>Tell her - maybe if she had finished high school, gotten any kind of higher education, or trade and that she didn&#039;t cover herself head to toe in tattoos, dye her hair rainbow vomit color and have piercings covering the large percentage of real estate on her face, and wasn&#039;t a NEET all her life that she might have had some potential job prospects.<br><br>*Pic Related<br><br>She tells me i had it easy - I tell her - no, i finished high school, went to university, had to work my ass off 4 years for a STEM degree, and im still paying off student debts, but hey, at least im on 80k a year and can fend for myself.<br><br>She ragequits our &quot;meet up&quot; - haven&#039;t spoken since<br><br>feels good anons","filename":"Screen Shot 2017-04-23 at 3.02.22 pm","ext":".png","w":270,"h":330,"tn_w":204,"tn_h":250,"tim":1492925604288,"time":1492925604,"md5":"YIXPhBUdJTfco66DVozRrg==","fsize":154714,"resto":0,"id":"vGry2kwk","country":"AU","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"sibbling-has-gone-full-retard","country_name":"Australia","replies":32,"images":4,"unique_ips":19},{"no":122386017,"now":"04\/23\/17(Sun)01:36:47","name":"Anonymous","com":"Awesome blog faggot","time":1492925807,"resto":122385690,"id":"XqWBT0ab","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":122386131,"now":"04\/23\/17(Sun)01:38:06","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122385690\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122385690<\/a><br><br>okay","time":1492925886,"resto":122385690,"id":"Ox+SmZXu","country":"SE","country_name":"Sweden"},{"no":122386169,"now":"04\/23\/17(Sun)01:38:37","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122385690\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122385690<\/a><br>Step right up and don&#039;t be shy,<br>Because you will not believe your eyes.<br>She&#039;s right here behind the glass<br>And you&#039;re gonna like her,<br>Cause she&#039;s got class.<br>You can look inside another world.<br>You get to talk to a pretty girl.<br>She&#039;s everything you dream about<br>But don&#039;t fall in love<br>She&#039;s a beauty<br>One in a million girls,<br>She&#039;s a beauty.<br>Why would I lie?<br>Why would I lie?","time":1492925917,"resto":122385690,"id":"nDhP4AgW","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":122386425,"now":"04\/23\/17(Sun)01:41:31","name":"Anonymous","com":"But there is a wage gap, in nearly every occupation:<br>http:\/\/www.aauw.org\/research\/the-si<wbr>mple-truth-about-the-gender-pay-gap<wbr>\/<br><br>You&#039;re right about the draft though, either everyone has to, or no one has to, and that&#039;s the position my feminist sisters take as well","filename":"Screenshot_2017-04-22-23-39-58","ext":".png","w":1920,"h":1080,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":70,"tim":1492926091985,"time":1492926091,"md5":"XA59fdSgBVJeKRe+CrKCVQ==","fsize":507532,"resto":122385690,"id":"uOM8adLP","country":"CA","country_name":"Canada"},{"no":122389056,"now":"04\/23\/17(Sun)02:09:02","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122385690\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122385690<\/a><br>oh gawd she looks evil lol","time":1492927742,"resto":122385690,"id":"PH2tMPXV","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":122389203,"now":"04\/23\/17(Sun)02:10:23","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122386425\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122386425<\/a><br><br>Very debatable.<br><br>Those statistics don&#039;t factor overtime and extra work within a company.<br><br>From personal experience - 1 year ago -Working in Network engineering, 5 people in department, 4 guys 1 girl.<br>Every day, girl leaves 5pm clock off time on the dot, no questions asked.

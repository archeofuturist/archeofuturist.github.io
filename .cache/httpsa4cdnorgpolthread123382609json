There&#039;s a resurrection of the unrighteous and the Righteous. The Righeous to life, and the unrighteous to judgement. This last for a thousand years in which Satan and his demons are abyssed. Now, after the thousand years and the unrighteous has learned about God and his son and the messianic kingdom and so on, Satan and his demons is released from the abyss. Then some of these ones, these unrighteous ones, probably millions of them will literally side with satan and his crew and then, All of them will die, both Satan, his demons and the rebels who had a thousand years in paradise to learn better but still chose wickedness. Then, Christ will turn over the kingdom to God and God, no longer needing a mediator since we would once more be where Adam and Eve was before they sinned, will essentially be there for us if ever we need him and he will talk to us directly.","time":1493501539,"resto":123382609,"id":"fWDHZtLL","country":"BS","country_name":"Bahamas"},{"no":123384632,"now":"04\/29\/17(Sat)17:32:45","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123384349\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123384349<\/a><br>God&#039;s justice does not need to be understood by you.","time":1493501565,"resto":123382609,"id":"qckRnaDk","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":123385031,"now":"04\/29\/17(Sat)17:35:49","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123384349\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123384349<\/a><br>It&#039;s not about fair.

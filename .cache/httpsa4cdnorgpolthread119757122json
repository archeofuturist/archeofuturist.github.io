In it a young Alawite woman described how quickly her best friend (Sunni) turned against her and her family. They had known each other since little girls, but all of a sudden it was nothing but hate for the Alawites. She tried to reach to her friend multiple times as if not being able to understand the situation, but the Sunni girl&#039;s social media was basically non-stop hate toward non-Sunnis. The Alawite girl just couldn&#039;t understand how her friend could&#039;ve treated her like that.<br><br>The same thing seems to happen commonly in Muslim countries. The non-Muslims believe the Muslims are their friends, but the Muslims turn on them so quickly it&#039;s a bolt out of the blue. It happened to many in the Assyrian and Armenian genocides too. Happened in Iraq after the 2003 Iraq invasion. It has happened in Syria where neighboring Sunnis promise to look after the Christians&#039; stuff when they have to flee, and when things calm down and the Christian families return, they are no longer able to get in their own houses and apartments and are treated like they had never existed.

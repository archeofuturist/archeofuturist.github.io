Anatolia had been in roughly 200 years of civil war on and off thanks to Christian Europeans literally burning it to the ground and depopulating major cities.

It was literally the muslims that returned Anatolia to greatness again. Anatolia went into a slow economic decline beginning in the 1600&#039;s because the Silk Road died out, which was the main source of economic wealth for the Ottomans.

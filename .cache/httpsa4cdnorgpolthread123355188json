The trouble is it&#039;s impossible to measure the cumulative effects empirically and establish causation, and tards like you can say &quot;look! the median income grew more quickly in the 60s when taxes were higher than in the 80s!&quot;--to which the standard rebuttal is that the industrial era had the fastest growth and some of the lowest taxes.<br><br>What you can easily measure however is where individuals spend their money. The rich generally spend less (as a share of their spending) on consumption than other classes, and so, the short term effect of a tax cut for the rich is less growth friendly than an equal burden being lifted from the lower classes. That being said, the long term effect of investment that the rich generally make is better for long term economic growth.","time":1493489663,"resto":123355188,"id":"IU98\/+Ns","country":"FR","country_name":"France"}]}

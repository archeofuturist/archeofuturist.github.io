The idea is to allow people who like \/pol\/&#039;s format a place to post off-topic stuff without being hassled by mods, and to help keep \/pol\/ focused on politics and current events despite the massive growth it continues to experience. <br><br>With respect to a name, here are a few guidelines.<br>1. The board name (e.g. \/pol\/) needs to be 3 characters max.<br>2. The board title (e.g., &quot;Politically Incorrect&quot;) needs to clearly define the purpose of the board.<br>3. This is not a vote, this is a thread for suggestions.<br><br>Ideas, suggestions, and feedback are welcome. Please try to keep things civil, and try to keep discussion focused on the new board.","time":1493346889,"resto":0,"id":"Manager","capcode":"manager","semantic_url":"were-thinking-about-making-a-new-board-and-wed","sticky_cap":1000,"replies":1000,"images":174,"unique_ips":500,"tail_size":100},{"no":123181033,"now":"04\/28\/17(Fri)06:55:00","name":"Anonymous","com":"<span class=\"deadlink\">&gt;&gt;123172790<\/span><br>its perfect.","time":1493376900,"resto":123131940,"id":"tX4o+GPS","country":"ZA","country_name":"South Africa"},{"no":123181039,"now":"04\/28\/17(Fri)06:55:05","name":"Anonymous","com":"hmrmrmr","time":1493376905,"resto":123131940,"id":"\/Hw9ba6d","country":"FI","country_name":"Finland"},{"no":123181043,"now":"04\/28\/17(Fri)06:55:08","name":"Anonymous","com":"<span class=\"deadlink\">&gt;&gt;123180873<\/span><br>Being too woke is bad for your health, goy.<br>Take a nap.","time":1493376908,"resto":123131940,"id":"8kNScFGU","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":123181049,"now":"04\/28\/17(Fri)06:55:14","name":"Anonymous","com":"<span class=\"deadlink\">&gt;&gt;123180789<\/span><br>We both agree that we don&#039;t need another board.

Or maybe give it some kind of tagging system where some threads are designated as funposting threads by the OP and can be filtered out if you want to see serious discussion threads or vice versa. That way clone boards wont need to exist and everyone who tags their thread wrong will be banned and every tab will have a specific amount of pages depending on how much users post there. You&#039;d have to come up with some tags or tabs for every board. I think it is time to move on from the 10 page format that has been used on this site for the last 13 years and either one of this should be atleast implemented experimentally to see if it moves up the boards qualities.","time":1493378744,"resto":123131940,"id":"+ljpnOLT","country":"DE","country_name":"Germany"},{"no":123183397,"now":"04\/28\/17(Fri)07:26:23","name":"Anonymous","com":"Bring back \/g\/uro.","filename":"papika ENOUGH","ext":".jpg","w":389,"h":361,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":116,"tim":1493378783110,"time":1493378783,"md5":"weMX1ygMgV1lzvqqo+Apjw==","fsize":39596,"resto":123131940,"id":"5AqZFDUP","country":"CA","country_name":"Canada"},{"no":123183399,"now":"04\/28\/17(Fri)07:26:23","name":"Anonymous","com":"spg<br>shitposting general","time":1493378783,"resto":123131940,"id":"PwIgCkhf","country":"DE","country_name":"Germany"},{"no":123183408,"now":"04\/28\/17(Fri)07:26:30","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123182913\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123182913<\/a><br>That would be glorious.","time":1493378790,"resto":123131940,"id":"2csIa\/hJ","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":123183421,"now":"04\/28\/17(Fri)07:26:43","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123183215\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123183215<\/a><br>David Allan Coe<br>https:\/\/youtu.be\/0rwnIqRl4gc","filename":"DAC","ext":".jpg","w":149,"h":149,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":125,"tim":1493378803179,"time":1493378803,"md5":"5rbiqmSf9Y1bgNG04mfQmQ==","fsize":5192,"resto":123131940,"id":"zLzCWlSY","country":"AU","country_name":"Australia"},{"no":123183423,"now":"04\/28\/17(Fri)07:26:45","name":"Anonymous","filename":"1616646(1)","ext":".gif","w":500,"h":273,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":68,"tim":1493378805427,"time":1493378805,"md5":"pYpt4EZyHIox\/r0NjKdm8Q==","fsize":316599,"resto":123131940,"id":"6AEzBU0D","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":123183426,"now":"04\/28\/17(Fri)07:26:46","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123131940\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123131940<\/a><br>If you choose to name the board \/kek\/, you would be starting off on the wrong foot by planting a homing beacon to attract hordes of minors who are the primary reservoir for that tired, largely forced meme.","time":1493378806,"resto":123131940,"id":"uyDsdY6n","country":"LC","country_name":"Saint Lucia"},{"no":123183439,"now":"04\/28\/17(Fri)07:26:54","name":"Anonymous","com":"\/sps\/ - shit \/pol\/ says","time":1493378814,"resto":123131940,"id":"Of4YgnQn","country":"PL","country_name":"Poland"},{"no":123183444,"now":"04\/28\/17(Fri)07:26:57","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123131940\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123131940<\/a><br>Seems like a good way to D&amp;C us.

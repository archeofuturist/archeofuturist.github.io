The idea is to allow people who like \/pol\/&#039;s format a place to post off-topic stuff without being hassled by mods, and to help keep \/pol\/ focused on politics and current events despite the massive growth it continues to experience. <br><br>With respect to a name, here are a few guidelines.<br>1. The board name (e.g. \/pol\/) needs to be 3 characters max.<br>2. The board title (e.g., &quot;Politically Incorrect&quot;) needs to clearly define the purpose of the board.<br>3. This is not a vote, this is a thread for suggestions.<br><br>Ideas, suggestions, and feedback are welcome.

What kind of shilling is this?<br><br>But just for the sake of it, sure:<br>It&#039;s okay to specialize on something and take up a role in society.<br>But if you don&#039;t make the effort to expand your set of skills, learn new ways to approach problems, and carry the skills you need to fend for yourself, you&#039;re not really human, are you?<br><br>You&#039;re less than a dog. At least the dog still has a few instincts that let it feed itself and survive in the cold.<br><br>Applying methods across professions, approaching one type of problem with exotic solutions, connecting aspects from different trades is what leads to innovation.<br><br>As for survival, any man should know how to maintain himself and his property by himself. Not doing so makes you a cripple who can&#039;t survive without the aid of others and therefore binds you to those comforts and turns you into a slave.<br><br>A free man shod know how to keep themselves fed, his car running, his house in working order, and his woman constantly wet and seeking his affection.<br><br>Any man that throws these things away in favor of being pampered and &quot;specializing&quot; on one skill only deserves to get thrown into the the deepest forests of Eastern Europe and left with nothing but a few essentials that he gets to choose.<br><br>If he can make it out, he&#039;ll start expanding his skill set and will have learned his lesson..<br>If he can&#039;t, then we don&#039;t need that kind of human.","time":1493543347,"resto":123456945,"id":"w3x18xB0","country":"RO","country_name":"Romania"},{"no":123459595,"now":"04\/30\/17(Sun)05:11:08","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123456945\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123456945<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;oy vey they are working for themselves shut it down.<\/span>","time":1493543468,"resto":123456945,"id":"LDekjZ2g","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":123461228,"now":"04\/30\/17(Sun)05:37:17","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123456945\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123456945<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;encouraging people to have rewarding, productive hobbies in their spare time instead of getting fatter in front of a television is somehow bad.<\/span><br><br>What the fuck is wrong with you?","time":1493545037,"resto":123456945,"id":"i31lw7qQ","country":"NZ","country_name":"New Zealand"}]}

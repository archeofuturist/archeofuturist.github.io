Demographers draw a line where Spain has no future and 30% of the population will be over the age of 65. In some Spanish regions, the fertility rate barely reaches one child per woman. Deaths already exceed births. Even the newspaper El Pais asked, &quot;Are the Spanish people in danger of extinction?&quot;. The Spanish government just appointed a &quot;sex czar&quot; to try to figure out how to sustain the shrinking population.<br><br>&quot;Spain, in 2050, will be a depopulated nation dominated by older people and singles. The country will lose 5.3 million inhabitants: 11% of the current population. By that time, there will be 1.7 million Spanish children fewer than there are today. No children means that, in the long run, there will be no economic growth or prosperity; democracy will become a gerontocracy and Spain will embrace global irrelevance. Alejandro Macarr\u00f3n Larumbe, director of the Foundation for Demographic Revival, has provided figures on the number of Spanish provinces that have already seen a loss of population.&quot;","time":1491397896,"resto":119588948,"id":"6EMXfKqA","country":"NL","country_name":"Netherlands"},{"no":119604895,"now":"04\/05\/17(Wed)09:13:34","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119604497\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119604497<\/a><br>Except the US has both a large and diversified enough economy to support it&#039;s own financial sector and your currency is the world reserve currency.

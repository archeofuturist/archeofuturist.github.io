Consider how dangerous technologies can be as they get ever more complex. For instance, see biological warfare, if someone wanted to they could create a microbe that has the potential to kill all human life on this planet. However, at the same time people can use the same technology to cure diseases and illnesses. <br><br>A totalitarian system always seeks to preserve it&#039;s own existence by any means. If it is not perfect it will eventually succumb to some sort of threat. This may be an internal problem, or an external physical problem (such as an asteroid).<br><br>This means a perfect totalitarian state must have technological growth so it can prepare for any external threat and survive (intercept an asteroid, stop a superbug, space colonization, et cetera). As I mentioned earlier you need a specific culture to deal with new technologies and some cultures are not as compatible with some technologies as others. For instance, you wouldn&#039;t want Muslims to be driving ships going half the speed of light because they could destroy a planet if they decided to purposely crash.<br><br>So what this state does is create simulations. These simulations provide two benefits: genetic and memetic evolutionary simulation. What I mean by this is through a simulation we can figure out which genes are optimal and which genes are suboptimal for what we want to accomplish. The same goes for memetics. We can figure out which cultural values are superior and which are inferior for accomplishing certain goals.<br><br>The perfect totalitarian state can then take this information and make the optimal decisions necessary for it&#039;s own survival. It can change both the genes and memes of the sentient beings under it&#039;s rule to adapt for the next stage of technological progression.","time":1491810354,"resto":120409637,"id":"w6t7FoAN","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":120410330,"now":"04\/10\/17(Mon)03:46:00","name":"Anonymous","com":"We are a dream that sprung forth from the void of non existence.

The problem is that we do not know what exactly would be useful to them. For that reason, what I want is space colonial particularism. There are many cultures throughout this Earth. Competition allows superior cultures to appear, however, some cultures try to exterminate all others and end this competition. <br><br>Consider the idea that there are possible points at which sentient life can go at which it is no longer considered useful to the creators. If we decide to adhere to a single culture, it could be possible our simulation would be shut down. Humanity must be in a position where there is always competition with other cultures. Humanity must never be united, but it must also progress technologically at the same time.<br><br>What I want is a space race in a multipolar world, where America, Russia, China, India et cetera all colonize the rest of the galaxies and create their own separate independent cultures. All of these colonies then evolve into their own respective cultures and compete with the rest of mankind for dominance over the galaxy. Ideally, through this much competition the optimal memes and genes can be deciphered and this simulation could provide use to the creators.","time":1491810402,"resto":120409637,"id":"w6t7FoAN","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":120410400,"now":"04\/10\/17(Mon)03:46:58","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120410081\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120410081<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;scientific evidence for god<\/span><br>i&#039;ve seen doezens of these, and it&#039;s all the same bullshit &quot;something can&#039;t come from nothing&quot; argument that fails to understand quantum theory and the big bang.<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;DNA refutes evolution<\/span><br>evolution is fact, build a bridge and get over it.","time":1491810418,"resto":120409637,"id":"MOYIcnU9","country":"AU","country_name":"Australia"},{"no":120410436,"now":"04\/10\/17(Mon)03:47:29","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120409637\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120409637<\/a><br>we don&#039;t know","time":1491810449,"resto":120409637,"id":"MpqiP+2p","country":"AU","country_name":"Australia"},{"no":120410468,"now":"04\/10\/17(Mon)03:47:50","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120410321\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120410321<\/a><br><a href=\"#p120410383\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120410383<\/a><br>Not bad.

Few of them realize the conflict is on a sure path to solve itself. Israel is going through an intensive Mizrachification process, and when it&#039;ll be done in no more than a generation time, either the Arabs won&#039;t have anything left to gain from the conflict, or the Mizrachim will force all the Jews to convert to Islam.<br>Once you know how they think you can see right through them. They hate areps because they fear being seen as Areps themselves. Once they&#039;ll be the ruling elite, where they&#039;re very fast headed to, they won&#039;t have that fear.","filename":"ZNJD7LH","ext":".jpg","w":1920,"h":1440,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":187,"tim":1493907281060,"time":1493907281,"md5":"viV5EhtsXxArI8jsl+VpAQ==","fsize":428865,"resto":0,"id":"XrxFYuWm","country":"IL","m_img":1,"bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"many-goyims-think-the-israelis-and-palestinians","country_name":"Israel","replies":9,"images":1,"unique_ips":10},{"no":124063696,"now":"05\/04\/17(Thu)10:16:38","name":"Anonymous","com":"WTF are you even talking about?","time":1493907398,"resto":124063532,"id":"zZltyuk8","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":124064759,"now":"05\/04\/17(Thu)10:27:56","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p124063532\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;124063532<\/a><br><br>Why would the mizrahim want to convert Ashkenazi and Sephardic Jews to Islam?<br><br>They maybe Arab in ethnicity but they are jews.<br><br>Explain.","time":1493908076,"resto":124063532,"id":"Qpqwzavt","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":124065038,"now":"05\/04\/17(Thu)10:30:57","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p124064759\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;124064759<\/a><br>Mizrahis are too stupid for non-extremist religion and too racists to share an extreme religion with Ashkenazis","time":1493908257,"resto":124063532,"id":"YQF8pI9G","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":124065264,"now":"05\/04\/17(Thu)10:33:25","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p124063532\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;124063532<\/a><br>But from what I have seen mizrahi are the most racist kind of jew.<br>The whole &quot;I will be racist to Arabs to make sure others won&#039;t see me as an arab&quot; seems like a shitty excuse to justify Jewish supremacists","time":1493908405,"resto":124063532,"id":"4FW+D0c7","country":"PH","country_name":"Philippines"},{"no":124065337,"now":"05\/04\/17(Thu)10:34:12","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p124063532\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;124063532<\/a><br>Go to bed jew","time":1493908452,"resto":124063532,"id":"8UZ2t+SJ","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":124066310,"now":"05\/04\/17(Thu)10:44:17","name":"Anonymous","com":"No but seriously and unironically we cant let the low IQ mizrahis get the nuclear codes when the Ashkenazi flee or get gassed","time":1493909057,"resto":124063532,"id":"Bb1m\/2np","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":124067483,"now":"05\/04\/17(Thu)10:56:05","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p124065264\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;124065264<\/a><br>They weren&#039;t always racist.

It&#039;s basically a sphere of sub-critical Plutonium surrounded with high-explosives which are perfectly timed to detonate so that the shock waves compress the Plutonium sphere into a super-critical mass.<br><br>The yield of such bombs is restricted due to physical problems, as with all fission-based weapons. You can expect these nukes to have yields ranging from 8 to 35 kiloton (similar to the nukes dropped on Japan in WWII). Scary? Yes. Destroy the world? Not a chance.<br><br>The &quot;end of the world&quot; kind of nukes (which were tested in the Cold War) are called hydrogen bombs, these are vastly more complex weapons which use a regular fission nuke to simulate the temperatures and pressures found in the core of the Sun. This ignites a secondary fusion reaction, which has no physical restrictions thus you can make the bomb as big as you want (just add more fuel stages). The process is incredible complex, nobody really knows how the fuck it works exactly except those countries which have successfully made the bombs. <br><br>North Korea has been trying to get hydrogen bombs to work for a long time, but failed every time. Once they do get one, you&#039;d know it very quickly. Hydrogen bomb yields are often hundreds or even thousands of times greater than conventional nukes. The largest one ever tested was a Soviet design with a yield of 50.000 kiloton (nearly 1500x more powerful than WWII nukes), funny enough that was the &#039;downscaled&#039; and &#039;clean&#039; version.","time":1492049837,"resto":120841375,"id":"bemIoYUr","country":"NL","country_name":"Netherlands"},{"no":120852013,"now":"04\/12\/17(Wed)22:17:35","name":"Anonymous","com":"Im praying for Kim","time":1492049855,"resto":120841375,"id":"b399qKCI","country":"IE","country_name":"Ireland"},{"no":120852022,"now":"04\/12\/17(Wed)22:17:39","name":"Anonymous","com":"Yay Republigoyim","time":1492049859,"resto":120841375,"id":"itSJaydM","country":"CA","country_name":"Canada"},{"no":120852065,"now":"04\/12\/17(Wed)22:17:55","name":"Anonymous","com":"How is WW3 starting?<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;we&#039;ve stated we&#039;re not going into Syria<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;China is backing us on putting Kimmy baby shit pants in his rightful places<\/span><br><br>how","time":1492049875,"resto":120841375,"id":"bMBqcWZa","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":120852096,"now":"04\/12\/17(Wed)22:18:14","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120851783\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120851783<\/a><br>Stop posting your shitty LARP faggot no one gives a fuck","time":1492049894,"resto":120841375,"id":"f+MPyW\/6","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":120852132,"now":"04\/12\/17(Wed)22:18:31","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120851783\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120851783<\/a><br>low battery blud","time":1492049911,"resto":120841375,"id":"OzPjXdSg","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":120852273,"now":"04\/12\/17(Wed)22:19:40","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120841517\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120841517<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Implying the Gooks have that kind of technology<\/span>","time":1492049980,"resto":120841375,"id":"HFhUhV5N","country":"CA","country_name":"Canada"},{"no":120852452,"now":"04\/12\/17(Wed)22:21:09","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120847516\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120847516<\/a><br>Well I&#039;m happy for both of you, if you do get drafted. me on the other hand would like to stay out of it as much as possible, I know we don&#039;t have the same recruitment system and thank god for it but I have no place in a warzone, unless I&#039;m some kind of camo fag with a rifle and specs ops training.

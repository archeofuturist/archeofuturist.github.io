They were not invited to our town and are not welcome on our campus. According to several reputable sources, the TWP is a Neo-Nazi organization that has a strongly racist platform. As a university founded by Presbyterian ministers we have worked hard to build and maintain a tradition of a hospitality toward everyone, therefore, we utterly reject racism in all of its forms. <br><br>This week, it has come to our attention that at least two other groups are now planning to come to Pikeville. Anti-Racist Action (ARA) and Anti-Fascist Action (ANTIFA) have both made it known that they plan to send contingents to Pikeville this weekend. These two groups are vehemently opposed to the TWP, but their tendency to incite violence causes me grave concern.<br> <br><br>The TWP rally is set to begin at around 3 p.m. in downtown Pikeville, The TWP has become expert in obeying the letter of the law while getting as close as possible to inciting violence. The ARA and ANTIFA will stand nose to nose with the TWP in an attempt to shout them down. Unfortunately, they may also be planning a more violent conflict. There are grave concerns among the law enforcement community that Pikeville was chosen by these groups precisely because it is a rural, safe town.<br><br> We have made every effort to ensure that the event on campus will be safe and free from violence. We are working closely with state and local law enforcement to protect both lives and property. Sadly, we cannot guarantee safety when three hate groups from outside the region have determined to pitch their battle on our streets. <br><br>cont.","filename":"1397058992976","ext":".png","w":500,"h":380,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":190,"tim":1493394081963,"time":1493394081,"md5":"jgAd6qb46i2VB2ufjqetag==","fsize":220620,"resto":0,"id":"+jklUyyM","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"there-is-going-to-be-some-shit-going-down-in-my","country_name":"United States","replies":1,"images":0,"unique_ips":1},{"no":123207201,"now":"04\/28\/17(Fri)11:41:37","name":"Anonymous","com":"1.

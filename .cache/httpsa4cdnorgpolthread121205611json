In Pyongyang&#039;s world view, Koreans are a pure, childlike race, virtually incapable of sin, or of surviving in a world of vicious foreigners. Thankfully, the Great Leader -- the mother-like Kim Il Sung -- is there to protect them, followed by the even more maternal Kim Jong Il. These innocent people are constantly threatened, of course, by those vicious, cowardly, hook-nosed Americans, who must be resisted at all costs. <br><br>The 2009 North Korean constitution omits all mention of Communism and the word communism was replaced by &quot;Juche&quot; meaning &quot;self-reliance&quot;. It says that an individual is &quot;the master of his destiny&quot;, that the North Korean masses are to act as the &quot;masters of the revolution and construction&quot;, and that by becoming a self-reliant and strong nation one can achieve true socialism.<br><br>North Korea is far from perfect, but that doesn&#039;t mean that the Jews deserve to have it. <br>The North Korean problem is an Asian problem and nothing for the US or Europe to interfere with. It can be solved with simple diplomacy, removal of sanctions and opening up their society through peaceful means, not by bombing them. Then maybe the Koreans can teach Europeans a thing or two about ethnic nationalism.","filename":"Flag_of_North_Korea.svg","ext":".png","w":1200,"h":600,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":125,"tim":1492259561212,"time":1492259561,"md5":"gg2+Nj4+7hogspAY7Own6g==","fsize":15077,"resto":0,"id":"Aw+CprBo","country":"NL","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"the-dprk-is-an-ethnocentric-nationalist-state-led","country_name":"Netherlands","replies":0,"images":0,"unique_ips":1}]}

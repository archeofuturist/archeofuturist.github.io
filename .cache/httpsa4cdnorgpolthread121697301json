It&#039;s been a very accurate calculation so far and may help us see what&#039;s ahead and prepare accordingly.<br><br>Chances are your country was once part of a great empire, which went through a semi-imperialist era when particularist sentiment was popular, which led to a group of bourgeoisie organizing the masses for armed struggle and gaining independence from the old empire or changing the form of government (revolution).<br><br>The successors to these influential men-of-the-people then kept turning the country more and more egalitarian, more democratic and kept appealing to the uneducated and easily controlled majority. This trend continued for a while and now you have in your hands a cesspit of degeneracy, lewdness, lack of principles, nihilism, defeatism, pacifism and other such things. Many of you are here hoping for &quot;strong leaders&quot; to &quot;purge the filth&quot; or &quot;drain the swamp&quot; as a reaction to this continuing trend.<br><br>This is the part where democracy will give way to tyranny, according to Plato, and we stand right here.

Most girls I meet are to busy CCing, getting attention, making a &#039;career&#039; for themselves to even consider kids. The few who are usually do it for some fucked up reason they won&#039;t honestly tell. Also I refuse to have kids the moment my attractiveness went through the roof and i&#039;m finally living the life. I&#039;m not destroying my womb or some shit by not mating right now. When i&#039;m 30ish I get a 20ish girl and things will go from there.<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt; working minimum wage jobs<\/span><br><br>This is the only guilty one most millennials are part of. If you aren&#039;t looking to either make a career or build up your resume then you are an idiot. But I can sympathize with guys who feel like it&#039;s out of their control. You either go through the bullshit that is modern college, with a debt in the vain hope you can make a living. Or you work for yourself which is a huge mountain to climb. Either that or you go for a government job, military or political. There&#039;s allot to make out of yourself and the training is done on the job. But it has it&#039;s limits. <br><br>The pyramid system is real. Though I am not of the opinion that normal middle class women are necessarily in need for that much money. Neither are kids.","time":1490495288,"resto":118304901,"id":"yqEOMRiO","country":"NL","country_name":"Netherlands"},{"no":118308184,"now":"03\/25\/17(Sat)22:29:39","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118304901\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118304901<\/a><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;living at home<\/span><br>not acceptable<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;not buying a home<\/span><br>if you crunch the numbers taking into account opportunity costs sometimes paying rent is better than paying a mortgage, also it&#039;s easier to relocate, so this is not exactly bad<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;not getting married<\/span><br>well marriage is just a meme really there is no need to get married<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;refusing to have children<\/span><br>truly not acceptable<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;working minimum wage jobs<\/span><br>well if you are stuck in a minimum wage job... learn how to tile a roof or some shit fuck","time":1490495379,"resto":118304901,"id":"snSJhXxc","country":"BR","country_name":"Brazil"},{"no":118308201,"now":"03\/25\/17(Sat)22:29:48","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118305118\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118305118<\/a><br>I think you&#039;re on to something","time":1490495388,"resto":118304901,"id":"awYt+Fdu","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":118308392,"now":"03\/25\/17(Sat)22:31:37","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118304901\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118304901<\/a><br>With few exceptions, the men have nowhere else to go.

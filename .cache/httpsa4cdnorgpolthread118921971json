Did he even read an abstract of the bill he was promoting? Why in God&#039;s name did Trump expend political capital, and twist arms, over that pile of shit over other legislative initiatives? Why hasn&#039;t Trump focused on improving his base of support in the Great Lakes region? How would that bill have helped working-class whites? It&#039;s a mess.<br><br>Trump actually thanked Ryan as recently as the 27th. He&#039;s blowing it -- the wall hasn&#039;t commenced, he hasn&#039;t been able to restrict immigration in even a basic manner, he is allowing &quot;special operations&quot; and drone strikes to continue in Yemen, Somalia and other countries in which the US has no vital interests, trade talks have stalled and Trump backed down from China. Yemen is particularly egregious -- the US is launching strikes for Saudi Arabia.<br><br>Trump has allowed the press to manipulate him against a rapprochement with Russia. He should not have fired Flynn.

We have it on the video on our YouTube channel (laughs). He also said that MMA is the fastest-developing kind of sport, and that it has a great future. But to be honest I am not too fluent in English, so I can\u2019t say that we were close. But only positive emotions. He was always cheering for Fedor (laughing). I know that for a fact. He was really happy when Fedor beat Arlovski. DESPITE THE FACT THAT ARLOVSKI WAS TECHNICALLY REPRESENTING AMERICA IN THIS FIGHT, as he speaks good English already had a solid fanbase in the States. But Trump was definitely in Fedor\u2019s corner. I saw his reaction after the knockout. He was visibly pumped.

That being said it might make you cringe whenever these topics are brought up or when some guy or coworker is like &quot;oh yeah they totally wouldn&#039;t do that because then we would just kill them all with our rail guns and shit&quot; or &quot;well everything would be better if these people did this and generation whatever-the-fuck did this and the president was him&quot; They talk like this is high school gossip. As if anybody who knows anybody can figure out exactly how it all works. Like the instructions to life is two sentences long and might require a wrench or a strong grip if you got it.<br><br>Or maybe the world is full of more geniuses than i thought. prodigies who travel the world and don&#039;t rely on a massive game of telephone to get reliable information. All so they feel better when they tell me about these topics and i just sit there with nothing to say because i know i&#039;m just another nobody and i don&#039;t control these world-events personally. Yet when the silence lingers that person feels like they just won the debate of the century. like winning an argument you make up in your mind to make yourself feel better about anything.<br><br>What the fuck is wrong with admitting you don&#039;t exactly know what is going on?

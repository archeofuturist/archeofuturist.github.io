Brennan targeted Trump supporters for enhanced surveillance, intelligence sources confirm to GotNews\u2019 Charles C. Johnson. <\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;The surveillance took place between Trump\u2019s election on November 8 and the inauguration in January, according to White House and House intelligence sources. <\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;The focus was on General Mike Flynn, billionaire Erik Prince, and Fox News host Sean Hannity \u2014 all of whom had close ties to Trump before and after the November election and had helped the future president with managing his new diplomatic responsibilities. <\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Hannity was targeted because of his perceived ties to Julian Assange, say our intelligence sources. Hannity was reportedly unmasked by Susan Rice at Brennan\u2019s behest thanks to his close relationship with Trump and Julian Assange.<\/span>","filename":"a4e","ext":".jpg","w":358,"h":312,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":217,"tim":1491438752163,"time":1491438752,"md5":"T+jNiEJmYNNO4s0ghGuAxQ==","fsize":95912,"resto":0,"id":"g0z0meqY","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"breaking-cia-director-john-brennan-and-his-allies","country_name":"United States","replies":2,"images":1,"unique_ips":3},{"no":119680175,"now":"04\/05\/17(Wed)20:36:15","name":"Anonymous","com":"Bump","filename":"0009","ext":".jpg","w":753,"h":753,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":125,"tim":1491438975178,"time":1491438975,"md5":"TZJ2bRoOexUQwqzKoq\/NdQ==","fsize":188524,"resto":119679777,"id":"bIQUg6Mi","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":119680816,"now":"04\/05\/17(Wed)20:41:07","name":"Anonymous","com":"It&#039;s unfortunate that the Republicans are such spineless pussies or this could be an amazing you-dun-goofed moment.<br><br>I suspect Obama&#039;s people simply counted on Clinton winning.

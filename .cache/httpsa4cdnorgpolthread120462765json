Looking into it though, its still not an improvement. Biblical purists in Christianity also began to reject the orthodox teachings of the ecclesiastical hierarchy as part of the Christian reformation, but only in as far as spiritual matters. On matters of governance, they drew a clear distinction between Gods Kingdom and Man&#039;s. The European Nobility loved that shit, its why they backed the Reformation. It got the church off their back. <br><br>The problem with the Koran is that its a full package deal. It does not just explain spiritual faith, it also has dietary rules, marriage rules, how to set up a government, ruling structure, inheritance, etc etc etc. <br><br>What made the Christian reformation successful was that Faith and Political Power were able to be seperated, or in some cases (like Britain) the Political Power subordinated the Faith. Such actions would be unthinkable in Islam which is a package deal. <br><br>More to the point, by rejecting the prior scholarship you just invite new scholarship. Which will be certain to conclude the same things in the end because, again, Islam is a package deal.

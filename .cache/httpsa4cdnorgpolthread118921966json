Atheism is in decline worldwide, with the number of atheists falling from 4.5% of the world&#039;s population in 1970 to 2.0% in 2010 and projected to drop to 1.8% by 2020, <br><br>Real surveys and statistics say atheism is on the decline worldwide. Sorry atheists but atheism is not on the rise nor is it winning. It&#039;s still the minority and a declining one at that. <br><br>The Pew Research Center&#039;s statistics show that atheism is expected to continue to decline all the way into 2050 with a continued growth of religion. Other research also shows a huge surge in growth for Christianity in China which is currently the world&#039;s most &quot;atheist&quot; nation because of the atheist communist government suppressing religion, the research suggests that China will soon become the world&#039;s most Christian nation within 15 years. <br><br>This is simply history repeating itself: Christianity prospered in Rome back in the ancient era when it was suppressed and it still grew in the militant atheist soviet Russia when it was suppressed there only a century ago with the majority of Russians today now also identifying as Christian. Just goes to show that atheist suppression of religion still doesn&#039;t stop religion.<br><br>Sources for the legion of whiny \/Redditor\/ fedoras that will no doubt show up it this thread:<br><br>http:\/\/www.pewforum.org\/2015\/04\/02\/<wbr>religious-projections-2010-2050\/<br>http:\/\/www.pewforum.org\/2012\/12\/18\/<wbr>global-religious-landscape-unaffili<wbr>ated\/<br>http:\/\/www.telegraph.co.uk\/news\/wor<wbr>ldnews\/asia\/china\/10776023\/China-on<wbr>-course-to-become-worlds-most-Chris<wbr>tian-nation-within-15-years.html<br>http:\/\/masterrussian.com\/russia\/fac<wbr>ts.htm","filename":"1490142549767","ext":".jpg","w":608,"h":755,"tn_w":201,"tn_h":250,"tim":1490881708348,"time":1490881708,"md5":"gbLQR\/M\/TdWWLU+dYjIA+Q==","fsize":123410,"resto":0,"id":"rvLcHzTf","country":"PL","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"atheism-is-the-fastest-shrinking-religion-in-the","country_name":"Poland","replies":12,"images":5,"unique_ips":9},{"no":118922575,"now":"03\/30\/17(Thu)09:55:47","name":"You idiot","com":"Firstly atheism isn&#039;t a religion, its a lack of belief in a deities, you can&#039;t have faith in some you don&#039;t think exists, as for the decline you&#039;re wrong where is your proof, I think sombodies butthurt and questioning their own beliefs, sad..","time":1490882147,"resto":118921966,"id":"K5ZSFLDr","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":118922808,"now":"03\/30\/17(Thu)09:58:45","name":"Anonymous","com":"Shitskins and retards have more kids than sane white people, in case you missed the last 20 years that&#039;s the main problem, so it&#039;s not surprising their Kangs memes are increasing in popularity too.","time":1490882325,"resto":118921966,"id":"Qi0Y\/6I5","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":118923452,"now":"03\/30\/17(Thu)10:06:40","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118922575\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118922575<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Four sources linked<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;&quot;Where&#039;s your proof.&quot;<\/span>","filename":"Dense","ext":".png","w":243,"h":200,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":102,"tim":1490882800820,"time":1490882800,"md5":"vO5D1RuRoSWSzB+H5CV4nw==","fsize":71580,"resto":118921966,"id":"QBBBe6el","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":118923494,"now":"03\/30\/17(Thu)10:07:08","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118922575\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118922575<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Firstly atheism isn&#039;t a religion<\/span><br>hmmm,<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;highly organized<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;had elders\/prominent antithesis whom they turn to and rally behind<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;uses propaganda to spread its message<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;fights tooth and nail to remove anything offensive to them<\/span>","time":1490882828,"resto":118921966,"id":"AZlZdrUn","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":118923748,"now":"03\/30\/17(Thu)10:10:01","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118922575\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118922575<\/a><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Firstly atheism isn&#039;t a religion, its a lack of belief in a deities....<\/span><br><br>Wrong, and wrong.

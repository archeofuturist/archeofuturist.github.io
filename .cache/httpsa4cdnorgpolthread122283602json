I think it&#039;s time we had a real conversation about the reds. Now tonnes of commies are out and about today, spreading their filthy lies about how &quot;muh gommunism&quot; is merely an economic movement, and not a political or a social one. Obvious examples aside, it should be easy to see that this opinion is pure trash, but I&#039;m deeply concerned that many of you are in fact failing to recognize this. <br><br>The economic aspect of communism--mainly that workers receive compensation based on equality wherein each worker is given compensation (by a shady entity that resembles the state but is not supposed to be called the state unless it&#039;s state socialism) according to his or her needs. Now this very means of distribution entails that there may be no democratic outlet for opinions on the distribution of labour or the distribution of products. Hence, the communist system is de facto anti-democratic. Now, let&#039;s go ahead and also prove it is socially revolutionary. This one is even easier to see. Workers movements require that workers of the world &quot;unite&quot; to overthrow bourgeoisie oppression. Yet the methods for this so-called oppression come from the economic freedoms granted by democracy, and even on a social level, commies never stop yapping about &quot;capitalism propaganda&quot; such as the American Dream, which keeps workers enticed by capitalism; capitalism in and of itself is a generator of social and community values. If one seeks to overthrow the bourgeoisie, he can&#039;t just kill the people, since that will only lead to totalitarianism, as was the case in Soviet Russia. No, no, the revolutionary must also kill the ideal. How? With a bit of commie idealism of his or her own, of course! pic related: it&#039;s revolutionary cultural propaganda made by reds.<br><br>Now I&#039;m sure at this point the plebbitors on this board are all but pissing their pants. That&#039;s okay. You don&#039;t need to be afraid. Just let the redpills take you as you drift into the abyss.","filename":"dirty marxist socialization","ext":".jpg","w":190,"h":272,"tn_w":174,"tn_h":250,"tim":1492872255731,"time":1492872255,"md5":"iC7cnhykTvRg8ZV1N96fIA==","fsize":16813,"resto":0,"id":"s1EIzp7q","country":"CA","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"tldr-global-gommunism-is-political-and-social","country_name":"Canada","replies":5,"images":3,"unique_ips":3},{"no":122284037,"now":"04\/22\/17(Sat)10:48:10","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122283602\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122283602<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;The boys in the yard<\/span>","filename":"101bec4a9307ee1415d711544e00ceef[1]","ext":".jpg","w":736,"h":720,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":122,"tim":1492872490383,"time":1492872490,"md5":"fIDUwDXQsYMxFcqV6tcZdQ==","fsize":90159,"resto":122283602,"id":"sLWoz2Xd","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":122284243,"now":"04\/22\/17(Sat)10:50:07","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122283602\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122283602<\/a><br>Communists don&#039;t dress that conservatively, if they did and promised to make everyone do the same I&#039;d support them, but we all know what they actually look like today so let&#039;s not kid ourselves.

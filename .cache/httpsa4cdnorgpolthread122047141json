It&#039;s a good idea, since while 15c.small plate brigandine is quite expensive, any autist can make a decent coat of arms out of small mending braces and army surplus canvas tent, and it&#039;ll cost him less than 100 bucks. As for the helmet - nothing beats surplus riot po-po helmets. And while wearing sallet with bevor is a great way to secure your health, people are not ready to go full 15centyry on the commies, more financial wise than anithing else - proper 14 gauge armor cost some big bucks in US, from what I heard. Still, they sell quite decent 13cen gambesons made in India, and that stuff is extremely good, in a sense of price\/quality. Not to mention that they also offer some cheap as dirt butted mail - not much, but will protect from a small knife fairly nice.","filename":"dirty slav","ext":".jpg","w":263,"h":204,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":96,"tim":1492726249799,"time":1492726249,"md5":"3JlUzvEjwMS++O7vYWsgjg==","fsize":22453,"resto":122047141,"id":"8Mkjhl3r","country":"RU","country_name":"Russian Federation"},{"no":122052502,"now":"04\/20\/17(Thu)18:10:56","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122051993\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122051993<\/a><br>helmets aren&#039;t that heavy, though they do make breathing a bit more laborious <br><br>That&#039;s why I suggested sallets.

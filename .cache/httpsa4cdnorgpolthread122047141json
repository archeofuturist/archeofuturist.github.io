In last Berkly riots that fucker with a padlock took a couple of swings, and the only guy who took some demage was the one that was not wearing a helmet - others just shrugged and continued, you can see it on videos. It&#039;s only logical, if you ask me. Afa degenerates don&#039;t seek a fair fight and will see your unarmored body as a way to inflict as much demage as possible, hopefully beat you up and humiliate you and your cause. Why in Kek&#039;s name would you want to let the do this. Again, it&#039;s not a football hool&#039;s fistfight, where the code may play it&#039;s role and where there is at least some general respect for opposing party - no, it&#039;s just another round of politically motivated violence, instigated by the far left and their subhuman chronies. I say, fuck them - get a helmet, a shield, and some body armor - you&#039;re not dealing with civilized men here, you deal with untermesche scum. They bear no honor, and deserve no respect.","time":1492730193,"resto":122047141,"id":"8Mkjhl3r","country":"RU","country_name":"Russian Federation"},{"no":122061562,"now":"04\/20\/17(Thu)19:19:31","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122059937\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122059937<\/a><br>It is inefficiently heavy for its efficiency compared to modern materials for body armor.","time":1492730371,"resto":122047141,"id":"G+WsVl2w","country":"CA","country_name":"Canada"},{"no":122061703,"now":"04\/20\/17(Thu)19:20:38","name":"Anonymous","com":"what&#039;s the fucking point of going to meet antifa just to have a stand off throw a few punches and claim &#039;victory&#039;. it looks so fucking dumb. nobody changes their minds, no structural changes happen, nobody dies, no territory is gained or lost, what is the fucking point you losers","time":1492730438,"resto":122047141,"id":"SMSrP2i5","country":"NL","country_name":"Netherlands"},{"no":122062007,"now":"04\/20\/17(Thu)19:23:11","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122061703\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122061703<\/a><br>50% virtue signalling, 50% looking for an excuse to chimp out.","time":1492730591,"resto":122047141,"id":"G+WsVl2w","country":"CA","country_name":"Canada"},{"no":122062029,"now":"04\/20\/17(Thu)19:23:21","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122061703\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122061703<\/a><br>It effects the youngest generation very strongly.

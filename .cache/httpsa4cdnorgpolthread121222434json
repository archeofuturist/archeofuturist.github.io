Now, ahem, it is as brilliant as it is infuriating. If you live like it&#039;s the past, and you behave like it&#039;s the past then guys from the future find it very hard to see you. If you throw away your cell phone, shut down your e-mail, pass all your instructions face-to-face, hand-to-hand, turn your back on technology and just disappear into the crowd No flags. No uniforms. You got your basic grunts on the ground there. They&#039;re looking going, &quot;Who is it we&#039;re fighting?&quot; In a situation like this, your friends dress just like your enemies and your enemies dress like your friends. What I need you to fully understand is that these people, they do not wanna negotiate. Not at all. They want the universal caliphate established across the face of the Earth and they want every infidel converted or dead.&quot;<br><br>Quote from the movie Body of Lies.

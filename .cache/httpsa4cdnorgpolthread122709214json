All it&#039;s going to do is just make attaining Freedom - not &quot;liberty&quot;, but real, tenable freedom, i.e. having strong agency over your own life - so expensive that the vast majority of the population won&#039;t be able to afford it.<br>We&#039;ve been seeing the affordability of Freedom slowly get worn down over the past 3-4 decades already. This process is only going to accelerate as overpopulation and ever-increasing migration keeps wrecking havoc on strained resource networks. <br><br>Without drastic change, war or revolution, by 2020 over half the &quot;first world&quot; population will be wage slaves, if they aren&#039;t already. By 2050 that number will climb to over 90%.<br>It will be digital feudalism. The cyberpunk dystopia is real.<br><br><br>The growth of a new super-wealthy is not an evil development. It is the logical conclusion to the circumstances. As resources get scarcer, elites will attempt to use their influence to horde what little there&#039;s left to horde. The difficulties of the growing lower classes will be compounded by their increasing irrelevancy in the new world order. Elites will only require a relatively small number highly educated workers to provide them with their services, the rest of the population are an unfortunate dead weight.<br><br>Altruistic attempts to help the poor or wealth-redistribution schemes concocted by revolutionary forces would both be fruitless. These will only reveal the uncomfortable reality of too little material wealth spread across far too many people.<br>This is the long-term failure of humanitarianism and liberalism. Dreams of unlimited growth are shattered as they are hit with the harshness of physically limited resources and a practical limit to technological progress.<br><br>So stock up, boys. If you are under, say, 30, you were born just in time to see the great crash. Not quite the end of civilization - but definitely the end of a golden age in human history.","filename":"IT&#039;S HOPELESS","ext":".png","w":510,"h":531,"tn_w":240,"tn_h":249,"tim":1493106176462,"time":1493106176,"md5":"QW1umqY8Oy9WxOV0tZo9iA==","fsize":227842,"resto":0,"id":"QvbqusVV","country":"IL","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"global-warming-isnt-going-to-wipe-humanity-all","country_name":"Israel","replies":1,"images":0,"unique_ips":2},{"no":122710311,"now":"04\/25\/17(Tue)03:58:19","com":"<a href=\"#p122709214\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122709214<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Elites will only require a relatively small number highly educated workers to provide them with their services, the rest of the population are an unfortunate dead weight.<\/span><br><br>And yet the elite keep making more and more of these so called &quot;Dead Weight&quot; with entitlement programs that reward them for breeding...<br><br>Really makes you think.","time":1493107099,"resto":122709214,"id":"J3wfW9Z\/","country":"US","trip":"!niqjediPCA","country_name":"United States"}]}

People who tap into the rtha or the corruption are able to pocess magic like powers, which is why Hillary Clinton - despite being an incompetent shill- was able to get as far as she got. She was able to feed off of the corruption energy and surround those around her with this force which fueled their existence and rise to power. Some worship these spiritual powers, these spiritual archetypes of war, vice, death, etc and call this &quot;molag bal&quot; or &quot;Mars&quot; or other names but it&#039;s merely a spiritual manifestation of the corruptions energy in the material world. Likewise, goodness manifests itself in the material plain and this is what people feel when they go to worship in a Christian church. It&#039;s not that Christ is lord literally, but that the ideas of Christ channel the rtha and produce a tremendous motivating force for congregations. <br><br>As far as I can tell, this is how the universe works and Atheist faggots have no explanation for spirituality except for poo pooing it as lunacy when it is clear that they are the loons who are incapable, physically incapable, of feeling the force of the rtha.","time":1493052703,"resto":122601200,"id":"v2zL+Swm","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":122606976,"now":"04\/24\/17(Mon)12:52:25","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122606652\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122606652<\/a><br>But can&#039;t you consider giving Free Will, meaning allowing evil and suffering is evil ?<br><br>But we&#039;re playing with words, theologists are questioning this much better: do we want to believe in a God that is not All-Loving ?

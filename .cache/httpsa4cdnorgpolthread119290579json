I&#039;d say it has more to do with Trump&#039;s use of social media as the template for future campaigns and those with interest want to gain a footing to steer the direction of discussion in certain directions. The problem with sites like this is that each board has its own culture and inside jokes so fitting may be too much work. The new tactic is to just spam the board with bullshit to grab attention.","time":1491194575,"resto":119290579,"id":"ggGYmRV4","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":119291596,"now":"04\/03\/17(Mon)00:43:49","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119290732\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119290732<\/a><br>fpbp","time":1491194629,"resto":119290579,"id":"X4zeVGDc","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":119291674,"now":"04\/03\/17(Mon)00:44:44","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119290579\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119290579<\/a><br>Trump won becuse of us<br>Normies don&#039;t mass redpilled themselves","time":1491194684,"resto":119290579,"id":"Bs6NNmtR","country":"US","country_name":"United States"}]}

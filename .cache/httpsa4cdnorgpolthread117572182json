In essence, it means that judges and courts should evaluate our constitutional rights and privileges as they were understood in 1789. However, to do so would so would not only ignore the intent of the Framers, that the Constitution would be a framework on which to build, but it severely limits the genius of what our Constitution upholds.\u201d<\/span>","filename":"1477046866684","ext":".jpg","w":400,"h":291,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":90,"tim":1490062774533,"time":1490062774,"md5":"GqOkpc3uotkI8\/ymrkDU4A==","fsize":17771,"resto":117572182,"id":"X9HyaiK9","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":117572804,"now":"03\/20\/17(Mon)22:21:15","name":"Anonymous","com":"(((Feinstein)))<br><br>Maybe she&#039;ll be the next to croak already.","time":1490062875,"resto":117572182,"id":"b5+YPs3n","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":117573113,"now":"03\/20\/17(Mon)22:23:50","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p117572182\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;117572182<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Oy vey the constitution is standing in our totalitarian way, burn it and tell people you&#039;re keeping it warm at night<\/span>","time":1490063030,"resto":117572182,"id":"Pf3TJkNs","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":117573298,"now":"03\/20\/17(Mon)22:25:28","name":"Anonymous","com":"<span class=\"quote\">&gt;thats right goyim we can just change the meaning of words in order to make sure you get tax breaks for have anal sex with other men<\/span>","time":1490063128,"resto":117572182,"id":"PEZOo1Hs","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":117573447,"now":"03\/20\/17(Mon)22:26:48","name":"Anonymous","com":"Constitutions are meaningless if you can just up and decide they mean what ever you want them to mean. <br><br>You either do the work to amend the constitution, or you respect the letter, spirit, and intent of what the Founders and Amenders wrote.","time":1490063208,"resto":117572182,"id":"EHGcT9XG","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":117573579,"now":"03\/20\/17(Mon)22:27:49","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p117572182\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;117572182<\/a><br>When will Kek finally reap her?","time":1490063269,"resto":117572182,"id":"jIrN7XCP","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":117573660,"now":"03\/20\/17(Mon)22:28:36","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p117572804\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;117572804<\/a><br>They stole the eternal heart from Rockefeller to give it to Feinstein.<br><br>the next one to croak will be the sleepy black dude. black dudes have high rates of heart attacks.","time":1490063316,"resto":117572182,"id":"+sSG9Dbi","country":"MX","country_name":"Mexico"}]}

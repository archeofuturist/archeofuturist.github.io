Basically it&#039;s a 2D spacesim with waifus. Setting is a mix of sci-fi and cyberpunk with greedy corporations and shit. Currently we trying to get funded on IndieGoGo. I need your help on redpill related jokes. So far I thought about feminazis as main enemy and enforcers of corporations, reptiloids as secret boss and few kinda muslim colonials-planets named Neo Sweden and Neo London (anon said better than Neo Britain). I need your ideas, possible references, more subtlety, I can&#039;t go full memelands retard. Nothing of this is final, I really would like to hear your ideas. If the project gets funded and the game becomes commercially successful I plan further to counter pro-left and anti-consumer tendencies in gaming industry.<\/span><br>https:\/\/youtu.be\/b51Xyrupsb8 [Embed]<br>\/pol\/ somehow more interested in this than \/v\/.","filename":"UHZ-mHw-5YM","ext":".jpg","w":1000,"h":1402,"tn_w":178,"tn_h":250,"tim":1492005756874,"time":1492005756,"md5":"exA9ulvgdPTIhifnIJviuw==","fsize":204386,"resto":0,"id":"lY\/gMic\/","country":"RU","m_img":1,"bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"im-here-again","country_name":"Russian Federation","replies":38,"images":1,"unique_ips":14},{"no":120758779,"now":"04\/12\/17(Wed)10:06:06","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120758477\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120758477<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;greedy corporations<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Currently we trying to get funded on IndieGoGo<\/span><br><br>kys","time":1492005966,"resto":120758477,"id":"6OwS5F7w","country":"DE","country_name":"Germany"},{"no":120758978,"now":"04\/12\/17(Wed)10:07:57","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120758779\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120758779<\/a><br>sadly, artists dont work for free, m8.

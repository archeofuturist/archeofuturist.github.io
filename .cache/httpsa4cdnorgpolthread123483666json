In 1989, the communist government in China massacred thousands and crushed democracy in the Tiananmen massacre. The response by the United states was to make it a most favored nation trading partner. <br><br>In the intervening time, probably your whole life, I watched a the United states joined hands with this regime, gutting this country of its industries and destroying the economy. At the same time I watched my fellow Americans treat their neighbors like scum and sent their investments to China.<br><br>I&#039;ve lived my whole life in America, let me tell you something. There is nothing going to save you from us (US\/China). These people care about nothing at all but power and wealth, in their lifetimes. They are eating the world&#039;s seeds. <br><br>I have zero confidence in the rest of the world which only seems to compete to race to the end of life as we know it. The model all countries are following is this: dog eat dog. Devour your children. <br><br>Religion is the opiate, preparing your anus for your own destruction. In light of this observation what are we, but global Taliban.<br><br>Of the program of indoctrination is successful, you become one of the destroyers without realizing it. In the end you destroy yourself.","filename":"20170430_072743-1","ext":".jpg","w":1681,"h":1985,"tn_w":211,"tn_h":250,"tim":1493563166146,"time":1493563166,"md5":"aFMssT+KolQReFKLDou7xw==","fsize":2065173,"resto":0,"id":"+Tt+3kkq","country":"US","m_img":1,"bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"boycott-americachina-before-they-destroy-us-all","country_name":"United States","replies":5,"images":4,"unique_ips":2},{"no":123483825,"now":"04\/30\/17(Sun)10:41:19","name":"Anonymous","com":"Destroying the world&#039;s ocean life<br><br>How can you proud of this?<br><br>How can you have self respect when you support this with your economic choices?","filename":"20170430_071425-1","ext":".jpg","w":1885,"h":2453,"tn_w":96,"tn_h":125,"tim":1493563279613,"time":1493563279,"md5":"9jmya3UHCS27+Falaz2k5g==","fsize":3175333,"resto":123483666,"id":"+Tt+3kkq","country":"US","m_img":1,"country_name":"United States"},{"no":123485034,"now":"04\/30\/17(Sun)10:54:32","name":"Anonymous","com":"Of you are a young person, it&#039;s not your fault.

How is it accomplished? Think of the donkey strapped to the pole pumping water from the well. So if donkey decides that he will oppose such injustice and starts going backward the mechanism of slavery will automatically shift gears into reverse so the pumping can continue just like before. They will even congratulate the donkey on being such great fighter, hero and hope for the rest of the donkeys. So don&#039;t be a donkey.

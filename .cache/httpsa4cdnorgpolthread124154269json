If you really think giving a &quot;voice to the people&quot; is a good idea you&#039;re a huge moron. People have no idea what they want, and it should be the job of a stoic intellectual to rule over people without any influence from money or media. People need a dictator and need someone to tell them what is and isn&#039;t degenerate. The best societies on Earth were all ruled by people who set strict rules. <br><br>If people break the rules they should be punished swiftly and publicly. An orderly rule from a moral and righteous leader would lead to utopia, but the common hubris requires the &quot;common man&quot; has a say. <br><br>Ridiculous. The only way to save the planet is for a righteous authoritarian to rule over the masses, regardless of how intellectual the masses believe they are.","filename":"marcus-aurelius-4","ext":".jpg","w":750,"h":1121,"tn_w":167,"tn_h":250,"tim":1493952939771,"time":1493952939,"md5":"sRkR4tfNbyWKic79CaB1gA==","fsize":181223,"resto":0,"id":"oohbL8SG","country":"US","m_img":1,"bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"politics-is-a-joke-democracy-is-a-joke-if-you","country_name":"United States","replies":0,"images":0,"unique_ips":1}]}

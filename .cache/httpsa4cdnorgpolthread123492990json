We also know for an indisputable FACT via their own public streams, videos and social media outlets that Black Lives Matter terrorists are also racist without any question whatsoever.

Black Lives matter protesters don&#039;t give a fuck, they simply attack you for being white. I don&#039;t think anyone would try and imply Scarsella would have targeted an innocent person who works for a living and applies respect to their interaction with others.<br><br>Scarsella was not threatening anyone. He was not trespassing. He had every right to be there and to be carrying a firearm. Scarsella had concealed carry training. Scarsella was being chased down by a mob domestic terrorists under threat of physical violence.

At the outset they counted upon the stupidity of their opponents, but when they got so entangled that they could not find a way out they played the trick of acting as innocent simpletons. Should they fail, in spite of their tricks of logic, they acted as if they could not understand the counter arguments and bolted away to another field of discussion. They would lay down truisms and platitudes; and, if you accepted these, then they were applied to other problems and matters of an essentially different nature from the original theme. If you faced them with this point they would escape again, and you could not bring them to make any precise statement. Whenever one tried to get a firm grip on any of these apostles one&#039;s hand grasped only jelly and slime which slipped through the fingers and combined again into a solid mass a moment afterwards. If your adversary felt forced to give in to your argument, on account of the observers present, and if you then thought that at last you had gained ground, a surprise was in store for you on the following day. The Jew would be utterly oblivious to what had happened the day before, and he would start once again by repeating his former absurdities, as if nothing had happened. Should you become indignant and remind him of yesterday&#039;s defeat, he pretended astonishment and could not remember anything, except that on the previous day he had proved that his statements were correct. Sometimes I was dumbfounded. I do not know what amazed me the more--the abundance of their verbiage or the artful way in which they dressed up their falsehoods. I gradually came to hate them. <br>https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=qTY<wbr>Sv_YQOVo","time":1492734308,"resto":122057270,"id":"90InlKPS","country":"RU","country_name":"Russian Federation"},{"no":122069233,"now":"04\/20\/17(Thu)20:25:44","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122057270\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122057270<\/a><br>Anyone know if this is any good?","filename":"52B0A199-6D76-4EE6-A2F5-8334EA692E65-16076-00000AB5BAB8BC2D","ext":".jpg","w":335,"h":499,"tn_w":83,"tn_h":124,"tim":1492734344229,"time":1492734344,"md5":"4RYpVK3bh2tXRiIrL3uUPw==","fsize":44022,"resto":122057270,"id":"fDCS21QT","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":122069333,"now":"04\/20\/17(Thu)20:26:37","name":"Anonymous","com":"The Discourses on Livy - Machiavelli<br><br>After Virtue - Alasdair MacIntyre<br><br>Explaining Post Modernism - Stephen Hicks","time":1492734397,"resto":122057270,"id":"9Qt0YS8k","country":"TT","country_name":"Trinidad and Tobago"},{"no":122069499,"now":"04\/20\/17(Thu)20:28:05","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122069333\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122069333<\/a><br>How&#039;s the scorpions in T&amp;T","time":1492734485,"resto":122057270,"id":"eVclXn0u","country":"AU","country_name":"Australia"},{"no":122069578,"now":"04\/20\/17(Thu)20:28:44","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122068372\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122068372<\/a><br>Thanks, I think.

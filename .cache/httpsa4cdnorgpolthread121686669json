Anyway, his theory is yes, that all this social and racial division is planned, its a script, I guess trying to keep humans away from enlightenment. He laughs when I start mentioning nazi alt-right memes and talking points, because his attitude is that we are just as much tools for Soros\/Illuminati as AntifA. It was a bitter view to consider. That said overall I still like lots of this stuff, but yea, &quot;all the world is a stage&quot; is definitely an Illuminati theme...","time":1492525359,"resto":121686669,"id":"2fO8cXoP","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":121691031,"now":"04\/18\/17(Tue)10:36:56","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121686669\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121686669<\/a><br>proof of them being in porn?","time":1492526216,"resto":121686669,"id":"\/viw2u2S","country":"MX","country_name":"Mexico"},{"no":121691495,"now":"04\/18\/17(Tue)10:42:08","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121689637\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121689637<\/a><br>Hahaha you and your friend sound intensely uneducated.

And there&#039;s certainly evil NWO types manipulating people-but there&#039;s also conflicting evil groups and good groups constantly battling. You can&#039;t just say &quot;It&#039;s all a stage&quot; since that&#039;s basically giving these satanists power to run the entire world. You will find most &quot;spiritually advanced&quot; people are tactical nihilists with a vague &quot;be-nice&quot; ethos without any plans to improve the world beyond 1) not participating and 2) supporting state-sponsered neoliberalism. <br><br>I do know the world is a game in that it is highly symbolic and the goal is to leave it. I also know the alt-right anti-war\/ethnic nationalism\/taking back power from globalists will make this a better world, and fighting for it provides lots of opportunities to work off bad karma\/weaknesses holding you back. Compassion for others needs to be tempered with wisdom and strong borders-this is an essential lesson of this world. Your friend should know that you don&#039;t get to leave by just sniffing your own farts and saying it all doesn&#039;t matter.","time":1492528072,"resto":121686669,"id":"UT5O6el8","country":"US","country_name":"United States"}]}

But I&#039;d change the desert part. SAA should ignore that and instead rush for DeZ as soon as Damascus-Palmyra highway is secured. There&#039;s only one road to DeZ that isn&#039;t hard as fuck and involving going through dozens of ISIS held-towns and villages with large garrisons so if the SAA secure it before any US-backed rebels it&#039;s good night for their hopes of getting to DeZ first. <br><br>I&#039;d say it&#039;s one they have to act on and soon.

Harris received such a ticket in 1909, and went to see the play during his summer holidays. The lead character in the show was a Rhodesian farmer who returned to England to wed, but ultimately fell out with his pompous fianc\u00e9e and married the more practical housemaid instead. The idea of a country where one was judged on ability rather than class was very inspiring to the adventurous Harris, who promptly told his father (who had just retired and returned to England) that he intended to emigrate to Southern Rhodesia instead of going back to Allhallows for the new term. Harris&#039;s father was disappointed, having had in mind a military or civil service career for his son, but reluctantly agreed.[5]<\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;In early 1910, Harris senior paid his son&#039;s passage on the SS Inanda to Beira in Mozambique, from where he travelled by rail to Umtali in Manicaland.[5] Harris earned his living over the next few years mining, coach-driving and farming.[6] He received a more permanent position in November 1913, when he was taken on by Crofton Townsend, a man from near Cork in Ireland who had moved to Rhodesia and founded Lowdale Farm near Mazoe in Mashonaland in 1903. Harris quickly gained his employer&#039;s trust, and was made farm manager at Lowdale when Townsend went to visit England for a year in early 1914. Having acquired the skills necessary to ranch successfully in Rhodesia, Harris decided that he would start his own farm in the country as soon as Townsend returned.[7] According to Probert, Harris by now regarded himself &quot;primarily as a Rhodesian&quot;, a self-identification he would retain for the rest of his life.[8]<\/span><br><br>Was it worth it?

Lung cancer typically manifests after age 40, and due to cannabis becoming popular relatively recently, there are fewer regular marijuana smokers than tobacco smokers that have reached that age. (Hippies were a fringe movement, while tobacco was ridiculously widespread until recently.) Of those that have, most also smoked tobacco regularly, which is a confounding variable in any study. We have found, however, that the smoke in a typical joint\/blunt\/whatever you stoners call them these days contains more tar and far more carcinogens than a similar amount of cigarette smoke. (This is not to say that marijuana is necessarily more carcinogenic. Tobacco contains nicotine, which widens blood vessels and may make it easier for carcinogens to travel through the body.)<br><br>So to anyone who says that smoking cannabis is safe, I say only that you&#039;re retarded for thinking that, as even though a direct connection to lung disease has yet to be made, all of the prerequisites for it are there.<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;hurr but what if I vape? *tips fedora*<\/span><br>You&#039;re still an idiot.

I think it makes clear sense. They have more money available, it makes more sense to tax a rich person more than a poor person. Why should a poorer person be forced to pay a greater percent of their income that could actually affect them than someone who has millions of dollars and would barely feel a dent in their finances and could still live more than comfortably?

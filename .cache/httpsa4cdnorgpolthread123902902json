This has led to the need to use adjuvants to improve vaccine immunogenicity. The ideal adjuvant should maximize vaccine immunogenicity without compromising tolerability or safety. Unfortunately, adjuvant research has lagged behind other vaccine areas such as antigen discovery, with the consequence that only a very limited number of adjuvants based on aluminium salts, monophosphoryl lipid A and oil emulsions are currently approved for human use. Recent strategic initiatives to support adjuvant development by the National Institutes of Health should translate into greater adjuvant choices in the future. Mechanistic studies have been valuable for better understanding of adjuvant action, but mechanisms of adjuvant toxicity are less well understood. The inflammatory or danger-signal model of adjuvant action implies that increased vaccine reactogenicity is the inevitable price for improved immunogenicity. Hence, adjuvant reactogenicity may be avoidable only if it is possible to separate inflammation from adjuvant action. The biggest remaining challenge in the adjuvant field is to decipher the potential relationship between adjuvants and rare vaccine adverse reactions, such as narcolepsy, macrophagic myofasciitis or Alzheimer&#039;s disease. While existing adjuvants based on aluminium salts have a strong safety record, there are ongoing needs for new adjuvants and more intensive research into adjuvants and their effects. <br><br><br>vaccines are safe.<br><br>the current franken vaccines are not.<br><br>mercury, barium, etc. are not safe adjuvants.","time":1493821481,"resto":123902902,"id":"fnOeFBBD","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":123916720,"now":"05\/03\/17(Wed)10:25:34","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123903537\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123903537<\/a><br>This right here.

Although individuals probably have a genetic predisposition to develop autism, researchers suspect that one or more environmental triggers are also needed. One of those triggers might be the battery of vaccinations that young children receive. Using regression analysis and controlling for family income and ethnicity, the relationship between the proportion of children who received the recommended vaccines by age 2 years and the prevalence of autism (AUT) or speech or language impairment (SLI) in each U.S. state from 2001 and 2007 was determined. A positive and statistically significant relationship was found: The higher the proportion of children receiving recommended vaccinations, the higher was the prevalence of AUT or SLI. A 1% increase in vaccination was associated with an additional 680 children having AUT or SLI. Neither parental behavior nor access to care affected the results, since vaccination proportions were not significantly related (statistically) to any other disability or to the number of pediatricians in a U.S. state. The results suggest that although mercury has been removed from many vaccines, other culprits may link vaccines to autism. Further study into the relationship between vaccines and autism is warranted.","time":1493823872,"resto":123902902,"id":"fnOeFBBD","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":123920489,"now":"05\/03\/17(Wed)11:05:06","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123920434\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123920434<\/a><br>https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed<wbr>\/21623535","time":1493823906,"resto":123902902,"id":"fnOeFBBD","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":123920498,"now":"05\/03\/17(Wed)11:05:09","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123919044\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123919044<\/a><br>Yes there is but you&#039;ll never see them unless you look for them.

According to Lam, all three vaccines combined amounted to more than $1.4 billion in sales profits for Merck in 2014. The controversialHPV vaccine, Gardasil also brought in $1.7 billion in profits for Merck. \u201cWhile a spokesperson for Merck told The Atlantic that vaccines remained one of its key areas of focus\u2014it generated $5.3 billion in sales in 2014\u2014she did not comment on the profit margins\u201d Lam wrote. Of course the Merck spokesperson would not comment on the profitability of vaccines because Merck would expose itself to more controversy. Analysts say that the profit margin is\u201cbetween 10 to over 40 percent.\u201d Lam also says that \u201cwhile the vaccine industry is likely more profitable now than in the 1970s or 1980s, this is the result of global market forces\u201d. Lam forgot to mention that billionaire couple Bill and Melina Gates pledged at least $10 billion for worldwide vaccination programs supposedly to combat polio and the measles, this is where Merck &amp; Co profit.

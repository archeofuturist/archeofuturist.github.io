They usually balance themselves in their mid 20&#039;s on their own or with appropriate lifestyle changes. Teenagers are more likely to attempt suicide though over little things, because their biochemistry is so fucked up. With severely depressed, suicidal people, sometimes the only thing preventing them from killing themselves is apathy\/lack of energy caused by their depression. SSRI&#039;s, at least some of them particularly prozac and paxil in my experience, are somewhat stimulating, they can give someone the energy they need to go through suicide that they didn&#039;t have before. Paxil in particular, made my jaw chatter and grind like MDMA, dialated my pupils, and made me want to go out on walks\/runs for no reason other than I had unexpected energy. Now the energy boost hits you before any mood stabilization (which can take over a month) so it&#039;s a dangerous time, that first month. Just be aware of that if you&#039;re seriously suicidal.<br><br>Now for me.. one of the biggest issues with taking SSRI&#039;s when I was a young unbalanced teen\/young adult was that SSRI&#039;s had side effects that interfered with normal social life, so I kept stopping them, only to have my anxiety (I was treated for anxiety rather than depression) come back and we try something new.<br><br>#1. It can make it so you can&#039;t cum, no matter how long or how hard you fuck. If you have a gf, this is really frustrating.

A team that repeatedly posts the same threads such as WWYD, wife\/girlfriend\/ex, cuckold, and fb\/instagram threads are spamming \/b\/ hourly, which slows down later in the evening. Around 8:00am US Western time, they begin to militantly post from mobile devices, sometimes a PC with a proxy. This is nothing but a team of shills and fakes. None of the &quot;girlfriends&quot; or exes posted are even legitimate. They ask for kiks, snapchats, etc for &quot;trades&quot;, which are nothing but a scam. Others post &quot;reddit&quot; links which link to a suspicious file-sharing site. They are all by the same persons just sitting here hourly.<br><br>Notice how ALL of those threads are in one way or another a form of cuckoldry.<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;WWYD?<\/span><br>Why would someone care?

My theory is that all of this is to essentially push some kind of kink to brainwash or perhaps influence a good portion of people. But why should \/pol\/ care? We still share 4chan, and these people who either shill or have been brainwashed leak into other boards. This is also political, as (((they))) are involved. The pattern alone where this is consistent and all relating to cuckoldry one way or another is not normal in the slightest.","filename":"1489390819454","ext":".png","w":1888,"h":734,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":97,"tim":1490247507552,"time":1490247507,"md5":"R0AtOgN0DuiBREh8mOcLdA==","fsize":372718,"resto":0,"id":"92uguKW3","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"cia-behind-cuckold-spam-and-bots","country_name":"United States","replies":9,"images":0,"unique_ips":7},{"no":117894611,"now":"03\/23\/17(Thu)01:40:38","name":"Anonymous","com":"Here&#039;s another important tidbit.<br><br>The bots for example have only ventured into two boards: \/pol\/ and \/b\/.

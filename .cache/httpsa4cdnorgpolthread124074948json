beer bottles at police cars and breaking downtown storefronts. In the process they broke a bank window, setting off an alarm. The news spread quickly and it resulted in several bars closing early to avoid trouble. Before long, more people had joined the vandalism.<\/span><br><br>By the time police arrived, a crowd of 120 had already gathered. Some people from the crowd lit a small bonfire in the street. The crowd appeared to be a mix of bikers, students, and transient people. A few members of the crowd began to throw beer bottles at the police, and then started yelling obscenities at them. The entire Kent police force was called to duty as well as officers from the county and surrounding communities. Kent Mayor LeRoy Satrom declared a state of emergency, called the office of Ohio Governor Jim Rhodes to seek assistance, and ordered all of the bars closed. The decision to close the bars early increased the size of the angry crowd. Police eventually succeeded in using tear gas to disperse the crowd from downtown, forcing them to move several blocks back to the campus.[9]<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Saturday May 2<\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;The decision to call in the National Guard was made at 5:00 p.m., but the guard did not arrive in town that evening until around 10 p.m. By this time, a large demonstration was under way on the campus, and the campus Reserve Officers&#039; Training Corps (ROTC) building[13] was burning. The arsonists were never apprehended, and no one was injured in the fire. <\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;There were reports that some Kent firemen and police officers were struck by rocks and other objects while attempting to extinguish the blaze. Several fire engine companies had to be called because protesters carried the fire hose into the Commons and slashed it.[15][16][17]<\/span>","time":1493915626,"resto":124074948,"id":"SGme13TD","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":124077399,"now":"05\/04\/17(Thu)12:33:53","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p124077239\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;124077239<\/a><br>No you aren&#039;t, not if you sympathize with kikes.","time":1493915633,"resto":124074948,"id":"XUWbpQ3e","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":124077403,"now":"05\/04\/17(Thu)12:33:55","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p124077183\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;124077183<\/a><br>Back to Leftypol","time":1493915635,"resto":124074948,"id":"oN\/HR0ar","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":124077422,"now":"05\/04\/17(Thu)12:34:04","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p124074948\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;124074948<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;three days of violent riots on campus and in town with vandalism, arson, assaults, and fiery rhetoric from the Leftists<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Multiple terrorist organizations were making open threats to attack and destroy the campus and the town<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Outside agitators were brought in to escalate violence; on-campus arson even destroyed a building and people were seen ditching multiple weapons to avoid arrest<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Curfew declared, protests banned because of the massive wave of violence and destruction.

This monopoly of the specifics of distribution is legally entrenched in every industrialized country with massive penalties for breaching it, and even the statistics quoted by the most wild-eyed servitors of the bourgeoisie suggests that it is upheld in upwards of 99% of all sex transactions.

All bourgeois monopolies seek to protect their power base by attacking those who would undercut the source of their power, and here too we see the expected result. Strippers, porn stars and prostitutes are all derided by the reactionary mouthpieces and it is demanded that the State put them out existence. And why not? They are seen as scabs or bootleggers, responding to demand by distributing products of comparable value for a far lesser cost outside the traditional business model (this is to be seen in the claim that these professions are &quot;debasing&quot; to women, i.e. it literally lowers the value of their salable commodity.) The rapist, therefore, commits a revolutionary act, retaking some power from the oligarchy that in a coup d&#039;etat gained quite literal control of the means of production, not of just ultimate commodities but labor-power itself.","time":1490663143,"resto":118587180,"id":"Zu8nF5xC","country":"CA","country_name":"Canada"},{"no":118589639,"now":"03\/27\/17(Mon)21:07:22","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118587717\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118587717<\/a><br>this,<br>if it was it would be called egalitarianism","time":1490663242,"resto":118587180,"id":"To3YAGRN","country":"AU","country_name":"Australia"},{"no":118589658,"now":"03\/27\/17(Mon)21:07:32","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118587180\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118587180<\/a><br>It started as a movement of women fighting for equal rights.

It&#039;s not a coincidence that patriarchal societies formed independently all across the planet; our species exhibits sexual dimorphism much like many others.

Any instance of a powerful female leader that you might be able to drudge up throughout history was simply good at keeping the society that their men constructed running as it is. On the flip-side, they are much better than men at expressing emotion and empathizing with others; hence why they are superior at nurturing children in comparison.

Women walk around in underwear thinking that they are going to stop rape. Also, feminism has justified abortions because it&#039;s not fair that a woman should have to give birth and a man shouldn&#039;t. Also there are so many women who have no idea what they&#039;re talking about in terms of abortion. Do you know how a third trimester abortion works? Because it isn&#039;t a pretty sight, sometimes they have to disfigure the fetus while it&#039;s inside of the womb so that they can remove it before the cervix returns to normal size.","time":1490662429,"resto":118587180,"id":"U5QDP4Av","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":118588162,"now":"03\/27\/17(Mon)20:54:14","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118587180\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118587180<\/a><br>Feminism is female supremacy, they advocate for laws and public policy which disproportionaly affect men worse than women.<br><br>if you really support equality support egalitarianism, <br>all people should be equal under the law, the government should not attempt to regulate cultural and social problems, only legal ones","time":1490662454,"resto":118587180,"id":"oecIgmp4","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":118588306,"now":"03\/27\/17(Mon)20:55:30","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118587180\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118587180<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;It literally just means equality for both men and women.<\/span><br><br>Someone forgot to explain that to the feminists then.","time":1490662530,"resto":118587180,"id":"OCJUkOG7","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":118588350,"now":"03\/27\/17(Mon)20:55:57","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118587180\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118587180<\/a><br>That&#039;s classic feminism<br>sage","filename":"slide threads","ext":".png","w":1156,"h":2031,"tn_w":71,"tn_h":125,"tim":1490662557862,"time":1490662557,"md5":"MQYcjjFVppI3Vdhe7m4ajw==","fsize":296781,"resto":118587180,"id":"DIWxk\/K5","country":"RS","country_name":"Serbia"},{"no":118588597,"now":"03\/27\/17(Mon)20:58:12","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118587180\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118587180<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Ask a question<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Not allowed to give the answer<\/span><br><br>It&#039;s like asking us why do you think 2+2 doesn&#039;t equal 5?<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;inb4 it equals 4<\/span><br><br>Theyre not equal dumbass","time":1490662692,"resto":118587180,"id":"lW1a+wQw","country":"US","country_name":"United States"}]}

And mixing what is yours with what is not yours in order to own the whole thing is considered great sport. But the notion is filled with problems. How much labor does it take to claim land, and how much land can one claim for that labor? And for how long can one make that claim?<br><br>According to classical liberals, land belonged to the user for as long as the land was being used, and no longer. But according to royal libertarians, land belongs to the first user, forever. So, do the oceans belong to the heirs of the first person to take a fish out or put a boat in? Does someone who plows the same field each year own only one field, while someone who plows a different field each year owns dozens of fields? Should the builder of the first transcontinental railroad own the continent? Shouldn&#039;t we at least have to pay a toll to cross the tracks? Are there no common rights to the earth at all? To royal libertarians there are not, but classical liberals recognized that unlimited ownership of land never flowed from use, but from the state:<br><br>A right of property in movable things is admitted before the establishment of government. A separate property in lands not till after that establishment.... He who plants a field keeps possession of it till he has gathered the produce, after which one has as good a right as another to occupy it. Government must be established and laws provided, before lands can be separately appropriated and their owner protected in his possession. Till then the property is in the body of the nation.<br><br>--Thomas Jefferson","filename":"billbo","ext":".jpg","w":400,"h":252,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":78,"tim":1492262963166,"time":1492262963,"md5":"AZbSj\/p7Ju7v269jobTTQg==","fsize":44741,"resto":121193289,"id":"0EwjkWCH","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":121210485,"now":"04\/15\/17(Sat)09:32:11","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121193289\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121193289<\/a><br>Why am i not being physically removed?<br><br>Phony Laissez Faire<br><br>AFTER conquest and confiscation have been effected, and the State set up, its first concern is with the land....

The State had established one monopoly--the landlord&#039;s monopoly of economic rent--thereby shutting off great hordes of people from free access to the only source of human subsistence, and driving them into factories to work for whatever Mr. Gradgrind and Mr. Bottles chose to give them. The land of England, while by no means nearly all actually occupied, was all legally occupied; and this State-created monopoly enabled landlords to satisfy their needs and desires with little exertion or none, but it also removed the land from competition with industry in the labor market, thus creating a huge, constant and exigent labour-surplus.

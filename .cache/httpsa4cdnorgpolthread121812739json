What many of our country can&#039;t seem to get through their thick skulls. Obama was up until the day he left office every bit the Liberation Theologically bound structural Marxist that he&#039;d openly BRAGGED about being as a college student . . . that he never somehow accompanies with a corresponding narrative of how he left that foolish ideology behind. Only he never had a country to govern that would fully accept his radical notions of a government&#039;s role in the lives of its citizenry. After eight later under his rule, however, and the country is eight years closer to a hypothetical future Obama governing according to the actual Obama&#039;s nature. Now you even have the GOP seeking ways to make Obama&#039;s steps towards a &quot;positive right&quot; of the government guaranteeing health care ever bit fiscally viable, with many who align with the GOP in elections--even the sitting president--agreeing in principle that healthcare is a &quot;right.&quot; Which takes a big slimy shit on the concept of individual rights, and weakens the whole construct by which the people&#039;s freedom from oppression are supported.<br><br>Obama&#039;s brag on proclaiming that his would be a transformational presidency was completely on target.<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;inb4 he was a center rightist, the claim of every single Overton Window pusher who&#039;s left of center<\/span>","time":1492586378,"resto":121812739,"id":"\/cMLpqg+","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":121817459,"now":"04\/19\/17(Wed)03:20:19","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121815823\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121815823<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Yes this is why their campaigns are backed by wall street financiers...<\/span><br>So?

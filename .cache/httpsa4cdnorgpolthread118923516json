Well, what does this post have to do with ..pol? I think Patriotism plays a huge role in people wanting to &quot;Put up a fight&quot;( apart from the warmongers and army barmy types off course) ..and well since everyone references &quot;cucks&quot; would they rebel against tyranny aswell?... Well you guys can list your reasons and grievances... I`ll just add as a Fijian national I think this is Truly accurate and records maybe even less than the standard mindset of a &quot;Native Fijian&quot; or a person who is a part &quot;native fijian&quot; the new legal term for them here is &quot; I Taukei&quot;. We native fijians are stalwart patriots, and hugely majority (concervative mainly) Christian. We are actually really peaceful,even though we have raised some of the best war fighters and peacekeepers. We have other races here, although Im not sure about their commitments in that prospect. (indo-fijians,Banabans Chinese europeans etc.) However, I have noticed that my kind are not cut out for civil war. Unlike the Americans in history, If we were oppressed by our own kind it would be very very hard to rebel, unless the native oppressor had committed genocide or something serious.<br><br>So yep thats my little take on My countrys will to fight. I want ask if everyone else from different countries to well give a little more depth and their experiances concerning the pic&amp;post","filename":"GGGGG)))777777","ext":".png","w":687,"h":687,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":250,"tim":1490882842206,"time":1490882842,"md5":"mpjAt0YigmDQtfjup1cS1Q==","fsize":391243,"resto":0,"id":"DsyymhaO","country":"FJ","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"would-you-defend-your-homeland","country_name":"Fiji Islands","replies":5,"images":1,"unique_ips":4},{"no":118923777,"now":"03\/30\/17(Thu)10:10:27","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118923516\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118923516<\/a><br>How the fuck do you get internet out of a coconut?","time":1490883027,"resto":118923516,"id":"pJJARKBF","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":118924232,"now":"03\/30\/17(Thu)10:15:39","name":"Maryette","com":"No Idea how but you can tranfuse blood or well maybe plasma I think<br> from &quot;BU&quot; juice.... aka coconuts....","time":1490883339,"resto":118923516,"id":"DsyymhaO","country":"FJ","country_name":"Fiji Islands"},{"no":118924568,"now":"03\/30\/17(Thu)10:19:51","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118923516\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118923516<\/a><br>Only if it&#039;s against the chinks.<br><br>SINK<br>THE<br>CHINKS","filename":"IF_WE_HOLD_ON_TOGETHER","ext":".gif","w":480,"h":270,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":70,"tim":1490883591711,"time":1490883591,"md5":"WJC3\/JsM\/bagKeCamW8JvQ==","fsize":1520791,"resto":118923516,"id":"s6hXMbLn","country":"VN","country_name":"Vietnam"},{"no":118925108,"now":"03\/30\/17(Thu)10:26:07","name":"Anonymous","com":"RARE<br>A<br>R<br>E","time":1490883967,"resto":118923516,"id":"ljd5Q3KA","country":"NL","country_name":"Netherlands"},{"no":118925299,"now":"03\/30\/17(Thu)10:28:14","name":"Maryette","com":"So we got the US...

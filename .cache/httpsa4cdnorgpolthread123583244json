There&#039;s nothing about their presumably-billionaire owners other than names(David Marmorstein Tassillo and Feras Antoon). Not a picture, not a history, nothing. Their website says absolutely nothing about their adult websites or their owners. Their rise to owning this much of the industry makes no sense. One minute they own a couple of fetish websites, the next they own youporn, the next they are THE porn distributor. <br><br>There&#039;s also a huge degree of shadiness in their past. Here&#039;s an excerpt from an article about it: <br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;In 2009, the Secret Service seized $6.4 million from bank accounts controlled by Mansef, a company founded by Stephane Manos and Ouissam Youssef, the assets of which Mansef later sold to German tech investor Fabian Thylmann, who made them part of a company he owned called Manwin. Manwin would later become MindGeek. In April 2011, Manwin quietly secured a $362 million loan from Wall Street firm Colbeck Capital, founded by former Goldman Sachs employees Jason Colodne and Jason Beckman. (Goldman Sachs distanced themselves from the two.) Colbeck\u2019s funds were in turn secured from other firms including the troubled Fortress Capital, masking the Manwin association. Having used the loan to continue to acquire tube sites and content producers, Thylman was then extradited from Belgium to Germany in 2012 for tax evasion on Manwin\u2019s profits. In late 2013, Thylman was bought out by current CEO Ferras Antoon and COO David Tassillo, longtime players within the company, who now control operations from Montreal.<\/span><br><br>Can we get to the bottom of this, \/pol\/?","filename":"Whats going on here","ext":".png","w":362,"h":66,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":45,"tim":1493616353170,"time":1493616353,"md5":"SJFJM5SHwM8pY9JaP2nYSA==","fsize":9365,"resto":0,"id":"Y8J\/5x+L","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"mindgeek","country_name":"United States","replies":2,"images":1,"unique_ips":3},{"no":123583425,"now":"05\/01\/17(Mon)01:28:21","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123583244\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123583244<\/a><br>follow the money","time":1493616501,"resto":123583244,"id":"PbrOhmvb","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":123583454,"now":"05\/01\/17(Mon)01:28:40","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123583244\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123583244<\/a><br>They might just be a name to give to the psy-ops division of the NWO.","filename":"IMG_1708","ext":".gif","w":800,"h":597,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":93,"tim":1493616520158,"time":1493616520,"md5":"APeCE\/m3Uk4\/60h\/pHa6Cw==","fsize":1087202,"resto":123583244,"id":"vMuZKUw7","country":"US","country_name":"United States"}]}

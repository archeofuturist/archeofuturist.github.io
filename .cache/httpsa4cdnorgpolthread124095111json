The more radical the country you go to, the more social brownie points you achieve.<br><br>SJWs have shown recently that they do not care for the women raped in Sweden and throughout Europe as they place Muslim migrants above rape victims in their oppression olympics.<br><br>The protests or arguments put forth by their parents to stop them going will only serve as a catalyst for their perceived sense of importance and rebelliousness. <br><br>If they refuse to go, quite simply they should be branded as &quot;racist&quot;, a lot will cave at the mere mention of this word. What&#039;s more to prove that they are not, will flock to the dingiest ghettos of Saudi Arapia.<br><br>Many will be raped, much like the recent Swedish tourist in Egypt or perhaps even murdered like the woman in the Congo, perhaps from these experiences they will learn the error of their ways, or at the very least will shy away from siding with Muslims on every argument.<br><br>Nobody will miss the hambeasts, and grieving parents and friends will swallow a major redpill in regards to the Muslim problem Europe is now facing.

We have 4 calculus up until complex variable, physics up to general relativity and introduction to quantum mechanics.<br><br>On the other hand, Med school here is 7 years.<br><br>I&#039;m asking this because I always see pharmacy students venting out their stress, talking about their hard chemistry courses and all that.<br>But when I look at the chemistry they learn, it&#039;s literally a joke. It&#039;s the kinda chemistry I got in highschool.<br><br>tl;dr:<br><br>Is pharmacy for dumb people who didn&#039;t get into med school?","filename":"IMG_7291","ext":".png","w":364,"h":271,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":186,"tim":1490592191301,"time":1490592191,"md5":"PpjQ+PPH2c44R3hAkPHMlA==","fsize":57012,"resto":0,"id":"2zmsb6Xb","country":"CL","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"hello","country_name":"Chile","replies":0,"images":0,"unique_ips":1}]}

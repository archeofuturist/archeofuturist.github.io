We have 4 calculus up until complex variable, physics up to general relativity and introduction to quantum mechanics.<br><br>On the other hand, Med school here is 7 years.<br><br>I&#039;m asking this because I always see pharmacy students venting out their stress, talking about their hard chemistry courses and all that.<br>But when I look at the chemistry they learn, it&#039;s literally a joke.

There are a lot of students who want to do &quot;clinical&quot; stuff after graduation which is possible, but kind of gives the impression they basically want to be doctors but didn&#039;t have the grades \/ didn&#039;t want to do a lengthy residency.

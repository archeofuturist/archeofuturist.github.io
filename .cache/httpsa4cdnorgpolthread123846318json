Yea, it isn&#039;t exactly political, but it deals primarily with \/pol\/, which should be enough of a reason to give it at least a little bit of time on this board. SHEESH. Anyways, just checking if the mods will be a little more lenient this time. My objective is NOT to make your board worse, I implore you to understand and give my words a chance...<br><br>I know most of you at \/pol\/ aren&#039;t worth talking to and are faggot redditors, but a decent amount of us at \/mlp\/ have been having a blast on PixelCanvas. That is, until the forocoches beaners showed up. \/mlp\/, \/flutter\/, \/mlpol\/, and some \/hdl\/ faggot redditors have been screwed over by these greasy, smelly, lazy siesta loving spaniards. The redditors have I guess been appropriating your &quot;le Kekistani LOL!&quot; flag and rubbing any significance it has in the dirt by allowing these barbaric sub-human beaners to vandalize 4chan&#039;s intellectual property. Currently, elements of each 4chan board that holds territory on PixelCanvas is under attack by these mexicans, and we have formed an anti daego confederation in hopes of repelling forocoches. At the moment, the spaniards outnumber us because \/pol\/ is utterly useless and incapable of mobilizing any sort of organized task group to accomplish basic objectives, due to autism and infighting. <br>I am shilling here today to see if any form of organization can be put together by \/pol\/ in order to help out the 4chan boards participating in this and to screw forocoches over. My god these mexicans are actually more relevant than you and its a shame :&#039;(<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;inb4 &quot;fuck you we aren&#039;t your personal army&quot;<\/span><br><br>Not what I&#039;m going for; just think it would be amusing to see two giant websites compete with each other for canvas space.<br><br>Link to site:<br>http:\/\/pixelcanvas.io\/@-473,584","filename":"kek vs spaniards 1","ext":".png","w":1602,"h":894,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":139,"tim":1493772312159,"time":1493772312,"md5":"dbi3zpJUnXlnPtmdy4PdNA==","fsize":421549,"resto":0,"id":"Sb9oGDfg","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"thanks-for-immediately-censoring-my-slightly-off","country_name":"United States","replies":3,"images":0,"unique_ips":3},{"no":123846857,"now":"05\/02\/17(Tue)20:49:57","name":"HWND extra promo","com":"<a href=\"#p123846318\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123846318<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Trying to recruit trolls for a battle<\/span><br>Ask \/b\/ those cadets need some experience.

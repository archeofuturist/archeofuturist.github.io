It&#039;s not even political, it&#039;s just beating eachother off about Trump. The average age there has to be under 20. Why the fuck don&#039;t you go back? Seriously? If you don&#039;t hold &quot;politically incorrect&quot; views, why are you dragging your &quot;based black guy in a Trump hat&quot; bullshit here? For what purpose? If you truly support Trump, you have to appreciate and understand the dangers of mass immigration and how it alters and dilutes the culture of the host. How the fuck do you justify this?","filename":"rthedonald","ext":".png","w":339,"h":270,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":199,"tim":1490513914561,"time":1490513914,"md5":"c9o5xl8xd7fFb5OCKPqapQ==","fsize":209699,"resto":0,"id":"2paNjGXc","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"the-donald","country_name":"United States","replies":1,"images":1,"unique_ips":1},{"no":118335857,"now":"03\/26\/17(Sun)03:48:18","name":"Anonymous","filename":"fuckin wew","ext":".png","w":1336,"h":2672,"tn_w":62,"tn_h":125,"tim":1490514498286,"time":1490514498,"md5":"PnD2mAz9iOz8jJ0zyP1K7Q==","fsize":837076,"resto":118335168,"id":"2paNjGXc","country":"US","m_img":1,"country_name":"United States"}]}

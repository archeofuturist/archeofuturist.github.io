The simple truth is that people don&#039;t stay the same throughout their lives, they CHANGE and GROW. If you fall in love with a woman, and you love her for whom she is, then you love the combined PRODUCT of her past. Every relationship, fwb, marriage, whatever made her into the woman you love today. If she hadnt experienced those things, she wouldn&#039;t be the woman you love. This puritan virgin maiden shit on this board is so fucking cringe. It&#039;s just sex.","time":1491327261,"resto":119482594,"id":"ir5Yytag","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":119492651,"now":"04\/04\/17(Tue)13:34:22","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119483747\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119483747<\/a><br>Can&#039;t women just take a knife and cut it off?","time":1491327262,"resto":119482594,"id":"IbH2HbBN","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":119492665,"now":"04\/04\/17(Tue)13:34:31","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119492541\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119492541<\/a><br><br>Tinder throttles matches based on whether or not you pay.

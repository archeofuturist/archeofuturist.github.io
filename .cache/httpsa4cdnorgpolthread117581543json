How can you watch the politics going on in the last month and not hate everyone? <br><br>You got Democrats doing their Russian lies and accusing Putin of doing everything including inciting World War 3 and Faking the Moon Landing. Republicans fucking up healthcare. Trump making up lies about Obama to distract from the lies Democrats are telling. An FBI who is not willing to outright call Russian allegations lies AND willing to spend millions to investigate Russia.<br><br>Its all lying liars who lie.<br><br>Liberals have nothing to be proud of. They didn&#039;t do anything Trump didn&#039;t get himself into trouble with. Its all been own goals so far.<br><br>They disgrace this country with their constant riots and protesting and not giving a elected president a chance to succeed.<br><br>Republicans are the least disgraceful but don&#039;t back Trump up when needed in the clutch and haven&#039;t portrayed strength when its most needed. They have no problem with ignoring student loans and cutting petty social programs but building up military and walls.<br><br>Also loathsome are alt-right people. When are we going to riot? Fight for our rights? Beat up uppity leftists, blacks and Muslims? We do nothing in the real world, not even join the RNC. Just expect to do it all by bitching on computers.<br><br>That&#039;s all I got for all the people I hate, now what about this country do you hate?","filename":"Land_of_the_Free___x_vegan_x_by_Activists-Optimized","ext":".jpg","w":476,"h":562,"tn_w":211,"tn_h":250,"tim":1490067542586,"time":1490067542,"md5":"8\/6Y0FO2Z9VVYRO3uACuWQ==","fsize":86918,"resto":0,"id":"d6QAP9lR","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"america-hate-thread","country_name":"United States","replies":2,"images":0,"unique_ips":3},{"no":117581924,"now":"03\/20\/17(Mon)23:42:24","name":"Anonymous","com":"Your rant feels contrived.","time":1490067744,"resto":117581543,"id":"r\/OKaED3","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":117581961,"now":"03\/20\/17(Mon)23:42:47","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p117581543\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;117581543<\/a><br>I hate niggers, spics, kikes, and the fact that I have to share this country with you","time":1490067767,"resto":117581543,"id":"w0FBX2ex","country":"US","country_name":"United States"}]}

WW2-Mode Edition","com":"The West is beset by degeneracy, both externally and internally. Can we fight this with the following strategy?<br><br>- Mobilize a WWII size Army and occupy Iraq. No half measures.<br><br>- Marshall plan to reconstruct Iraq in our image, but everything for the reconstruction is built by the reconstituted manufacturing and powered by unleashed American energy reserves.<br><br>- You&#039;re goddamned right we are taking the oil to pay for it.<br><br>- No bullshit deferments, if you can fight you are called up. Fatties are literally forced starved in pre-bootcamp.<br><br>- DO NOT MIX CURRENT PROFESSIONAL BRANCHES WITH DRAFTEEFAGS!!! Drafted snowflakes get safe logistical\/admin\/civil affairs jobs with even no weapons training. De-cucked and woke draftees can have more of a defensive role and in turn receive training that will check elite power down the line. The volunteer professional branches in existence prosecute a full sweep, lockdown and pacification for the country using local forces as human shields.<br><br>- Write fucking treaties with the Sunnis and Kurds making Shia BTFO with their retributions and ethnic cleansing.<br><br>- They have a secular past, it&#039;s just totalitarian ba&#039;athist. We force them to be like Turkey used to be and they&#039;re collectively so war weary from the sanctions regime of the nineties, the insurgency, and IS that they take the deal. Think of this like a &quot;prop-a-mole&quot; strategy, we lose \/our guy\/ Turkey so we make a new guy out of Iraq.<br><br>- Russia and the FAGs (French, Anglos, Germans) carve up Syria. The FAGs cover East Syria.<br><br>- Iran gets BTFO from massive tracts of sand, their regional leverage plummets if they can&#039;t threaten invasion on Saudi. End of Persian superpower delusions.<br><br>- Snowflakes and betas mature and take civic pride in their country and it&#039;s civilizational enterprise. Return home and have now earned healthcare and college instead of it being a some soul sucking socialist handout.<br><br>- Chicoms are triggered and helpless to resist.<br><br><br>OP has actually seen combat","filename":"this_is_the_problem","ext":".png","w":769,"h":378,"tn_w":249,"tn_h":122,"tim":1490156818026,"time":1490156818,"md5":"NXvMcc2K1z27kpKr4sCH8Q==","fsize":390936,"resto":0,"id":"iQpt1N1N","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"how-do-we-reverse-degeneracy-in-our-time-ww2mode","country_name":"United States","replies":2,"images":0,"unique_ips":3},{"no":117719886,"now":"03\/22\/17(Wed)00:30:43","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p117719525\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;117719525<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Iran gets BTFO; end of Persian superpower delusions.<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Snowflakes and betas mature and take civic pride in their country and it&#039;s civilizational enterprise.<\/span><br>Not bad OP; not bad at all.","time":1490157043,"resto":117719525,"id":"HQ71o9vS","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":117720508,"now":"03\/22\/17(Wed)00:37:10","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p117719525\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;117719525<\/a><br>We fought for the wrong side","time":1490157430,"resto":117719525,"id":"v+E3rh\/J","country":"AU","country_name":"Australia"}]}

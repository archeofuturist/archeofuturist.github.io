Arguing solely with logic is not generally the best way to go. You have to weave emotions into arguments even if its not in words, but the way you speak. Say you make a great sound argument but say it in a flat tone. It wont be as effective if you said it with passion to effectively manipulate them into believe what you believe. There&#039;s a medieval course for lack of a better word called trivium that shows how to argue and become a better thinker (at least in theory). Basically it is divided into 3 components: grammar, logic and rhetoric. You learn them in that order. First you learn definitions and order of speech. Then you learn how to use grammar to form sound arguments (logic). Then you apply rhetoric and figure out ways to convince people by presenting and saying it right. Also remember, everyone thinks differently so theres no one way to convince everyone.","time":1493456738,"resto":123313401,"id":"Acm2NgxX","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":123315397,"now":"04\/29\/17(Sat)05:08:34","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123314798\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123314798<\/a><br>Hey, those are my children and they&#039;ll follow whatever fad I tell them to.","filename":"1492739740327","ext":".jpg","w":710,"h":473,"tn_w":124,"tn_h":83,"tim":1493456914788,"time":1493456914,"md5":"KYG2Thb1eQLsc\/PYGc5lfQ==","fsize":148496,"resto":123313401,"id":"UvFTfml2","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":123315426,"now":"04\/29\/17(Sat)05:09:01","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123314798\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123314798<\/a><br>True, the problem is which my dad repeats to me constantly, you really don&#039;t know what youre talking about unless you REALLY study it.

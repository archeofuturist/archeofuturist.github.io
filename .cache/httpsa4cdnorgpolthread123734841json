Nations have borders, language, and culture &amp; they have laws that protect all 3.<br><br>2) Be an empire. Empires force different cultures and languages to mix under one authority and promote a homogeneous society. This is why empires always fall. <br><br>The US has crossed this line. We are no longer a nation. We are an empire and we are teetering on the brink of dissolution. <br><br>Borders exist for a reason. They exist because group of people A do not share the beliefs or values of group of people B. Generally speaking, as long as everyone stays on their side of the fence everything will be fine. But when you force A+B together conflict inevitably erupts.<br><br>Our &quot;nation&quot; has become too polarized to remain intact. It MUST break apart. It WILL break apart. The only question now is whether it will be peaceful or bloody. <br><br>We need to start pushing for the peaceful fracturing of the USA. Our nation is dead.","filename":"America-breakup","ext":".gif","w":570,"h":374,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":164,"tim":1493704645461,"time":1493704645,"md5":"e6h184xLmUtFGi0icdUOQA==","fsize":62181,"resto":0,"id":"NL+E2ZkC","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"the-usa-must-and-will-break-up","country_name":"United States","replies":1,"images":0,"unique_ips":2},{"no":123734973,"now":"05\/02\/17(Tue)01:59:06","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123734841\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123734841<\/a><br>WRONG<br><br>We are one people <br>We are one country <br>We are under one god <br><br>This country can and will come together.

A civilized country cannot function a system where you can&#039;t get electricity out of the socket on a clody and windless day. Currently no method of storing energy when circumstances are good to use later is viable to be used in such large scale. This is why solar and wind power are called &#039;secondary&#039; power sources. A country must fulfill it&#039;s peak electricity consumption with PRIMARY power sources, which are nuclear, coal, oil, gas, etc, which can be run regardless of uncontrollable circumstances. Solar and Wind are used in conjuction so that total electricity production is much more than needed, but pollution heavy and costly gas power plants are not normally in use and are used when solar\/wind power can&#039;t function due to shitty weather to keep the grid at proper currents.","filename":"1479831119889","ext":".png","w":1269,"h":1268,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":124,"tim":1490480501374,"time":1490480501,"md5":"qI6zNYJRLfHFeuxeqKiUdA==","fsize":247450,"resto":118277119,"id":"9dj1nX\/\/","country":"FI","country_name":"Finland"},{"no":118280673,"now":"03\/25\/17(Sat)18:21:44","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118277119\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118277119<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;very clean<\/span><br>dropped","time":1490480504,"resto":118277119,"id":"hEFrs86Z","country":"LT","country_name":"Lithuania"},{"no":118280912,"now":"03\/25\/17(Sat)18:23:56","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118280508\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118280508<\/a><br>So basically if we had natsoc instead of crapitalism\/lolbertardianism\/demosh<wbr>itcy and cultural Marxism, we could have used nuclear power to get ourselves situated in space and Dyson sphere the sun by now.

Current uranium levels in uranium ore are so low that you actually need more fossil power to dig it up and enrich it than you get from reactor. Easy uranium deposits were depleted during cold war and now only few remain. Current uranium levels are around 0,2-0,3% while during cold war some uranium mines had 40% levels. You have to dig up massive amounts of earth to make 100 tons of enriched nuclear fuel. <br><br>This raises question why build nuclear power if it takes power than it creates?<br><br>The answer is plutonium which can be only created by nuclear fission. Plutonium inside nukes needs to be replaced every 3-4 years or it doesn&#039;t go critical anymore. This creates constant need for it while supply is limited, ton of plutonium costs several billions. <br><br>Obviously nuclear industry and military doesn&#039;t want people to know how nuclear power maintains nuclear weapons. That&#039;s why everything what&#039;s been told to public about nuclear power is a lie. They have downplayed and censored every nuclear accident just like they did with Fukushima. <br><br>They don&#039;t build thorium reactors simply because it doesn&#039;t create plutonium. <br><br>Earth is full of uranium but digging it up and enriching it consumes more fossil power than nuclear reactor produces. They simply do it for plutonium which creates massive dark revenue for nuclear companies. <br><br>That&#039;s the redpill about nuclear power.","time":1490481581,"resto":118277119,"id":"MUH\/1zcM","country":"FI","country_name":"Finland"},{"no":118282789,"now":"03\/25\/17(Sat)18:40:18","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118277831\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118277831<\/a><br>REEEE YOU SAID THE EXACT SAME THING WITH A JAPANESE PROXY LAST TIME AND I DEBUNKED YOU","time":1490481618,"resto":118277119,"id":"lbknKs1D","country":"AU","country_name":"Australia"},{"no":118282857,"now":"03\/25\/17(Sat)18:41:02","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118279635\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118279635<\/a><br>I don&#039;t think it&#039;s possible to die &quot;Instantaneously&quot; from radiation.

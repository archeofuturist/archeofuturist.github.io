It&#039;s a shame, but everyone stopped caring about the Vatican and its role in the world. People saw it as a &quot;dumb&quot; religion, and openly mocked it to near death. Then all the scandals of child rape reared its ugly head in the media, and its all we heard about for years. <br><br>Que modern times, now religion is making a comeback, but in the forum of Islam. It&#039;s an open ideology that feeds on the downfall of society and other religions. It&#039;s gotten so out of hand that, well, we all know here what Islam is capable of.<br><br>The fall of the Catholic church and the rise of Islam is almost pre-planned by the same media presence we just exposed in the election cycles as corrupt and agenda driven. The same kikes who are responsible for destroying Europe right now, and the same people that destroyed the modern societal views of the Catholic faith.<br><br>What can we do, when literally no one gives a shit? Between that dyke carpet muncher Priestess out of Sweden calling for the removal of the cross, and installments of Muslim prayer sections inside the church, to our Pope literally calling Jesus the devil, what recourse do we have? How can we impact society in a positive way about PROPER religion?<br><br>If the lord gives me trips through kek, its our mission to meme the Catholic church and Christian values back into modern society. To save the world from Islam, and itself.","filename":"1473709333991","ext":".jpg","w":720,"h":511,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":177,"tim":1492042032823,"time":1492042032,"md5":"DxmbMm0huW1Bp++CMSOKZA==","fsize":75727,"resto":0,"id":"1MdOUV\/m","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"pope-names-jesus-christ-as-the-devil","country_name":"United States","replies":14,"images":2,"unique_ips":11},{"no":120835059,"now":"04\/12\/17(Wed)20:09:28","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120834733\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120834733<\/a><br>The pope is a satanic cuck and has been for a long time.","time":1492042168,"resto":120834733,"id":"anM1\/0Z4","country":"NZ","country_name":"New Zealand"},{"no":120835085,"now":"04\/12\/17(Wed)20:09:38","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120834733\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120834733<\/a><br>That Pope is a fucking atheist.","time":1492042178,"resto":120834733,"id":"qjNOkTMS","country":"ME","country_name":"Montenegro"},{"no":120835791,"now":"04\/12\/17(Wed)20:14:46","name":"Anonymous","com":"Why did people stop believing in Christianity?

Long 16-hour workdays they have to share between 2-3 jobs just to make ends meet, and live in a shitty apartment the size of most American hallways. Japs can&#039;t into real capitalism, it turns out to be some authoritarian pseudo-communist system that LARPs like capitalism.<br><br>Now it wouldn&#039;t be so bad if they had some form of heterogeneity, but they don&#039;t. All of them look the same. All of them talk the same. All of them are forced to fit in and do the same things over and over again, and if they mess up at their jobs, they are treated like subhuman garbage.<br><br>So that is why their anime is weird, and their culture is strange and eccentric.

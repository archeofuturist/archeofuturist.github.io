Long 16-hour workdays they have to share between 2-3 jobs just to make ends meet, and live in a shitty apartment the size of most American hallways. Japs can&#039;t into real capitalism, it turns out to be some authoritarian pseudo-communist system that LARPs like capitalism.<br><br>Now it wouldn&#039;t be so bad if they had some form of heterogeneity, but they don&#039;t. All of them look the same. All of them talk the same. All of them are forced to fit in and do the same things over and over again, and if they mess up at their jobs, they are treated like subhuman garbage.<br><br>So that is why their anime is weird, and their culture is strange and eccentric. Because if it wasn&#039;t, their suicide rate would skyrocket. There&#039;s a good documentary about this on YouTube, it&#039;s called Japan: A Story of Love and Hate.","time":1492877577,"resto":122292462,"id":"nq+O4vQf","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":122294031,"now":"04\/22\/17(Sat)12:18:33","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122292462\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122292462<\/a><br><br>Anime wouldn&#039;t exist if it wasn&#039;t for Walt Disney.","filename":"momotaro","ext":".jpg","w":480,"h":360,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":93,"tim":1492877913737,"time":1492877913,"md5":"StS5CaBfgygDVyd3M1Q3Gg==","fsize":21240,"resto":122292462,"id":"79K6igbD","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":122295446,"now":"04\/22\/17(Sat)12:31:26","name":"Anonymous","com":"Anime would be fine regardless if the nukes happened or not.","filename":"The Dream of the Fisherman&#039;s Wife","ext":".jpg","w":1200,"h":837,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":87,"tim":1492878686612,"time":1492878686,"md5":"Eaeza8n7NsG3zdVV0Pia4g==","fsize":354508,"resto":122292462,"id":"2C4t5xfx","country":"CA","m_img":1,"country_name":"Canada"},{"no":122295497,"now":"04\/22\/17(Sat)12:32:01","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122295446\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122295446<\/a>","filename":"TWO NUKES DID NOTHING","ext":".jpg","w":4050,"h":750,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":23,"tim":1492878721261,"time":1492878721,"md5":"FFrqOEa3m0gw849Df0Ghuw==","fsize":606194,"resto":122292462,"id":"2C4t5xfx","country":"CA","m_img":1,"country_name":"Canada"},{"no":122295552,"now":"04\/22\/17(Sat)12:32:42","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122292462\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122292462<\/a><br>Anime existed before Japan got involved in WW2 dumb yank","time":1492878762,"resto":122292462,"id":"rfwUXN\/M","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":122295695,"now":"04\/22\/17(Sat)12:34:15","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122293334\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122293334<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Long 16-hour workdays they have to share between 2-3 jobs just to make ends meet<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;live in a shitty apartment the size of most American hallways<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;if they mess up at their jobs, they are treated like subhuman garbage<\/span><br>and we want to be like them because?","time":1492878855,"resto":122292462,"id":"RuWV4aRT","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":122296151,"now":"04\/22\/17(Sat)12:38:44","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122295446\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122295446<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;there goes the noble ancient japan meme<\/span>","time":1492879124,"resto":122292462,"id":"O2S9LNWA","country":"CZ","country_name":"Czech Republic"},{"no":122296418,"now":"04\/22\/17(Sat)12:41:15","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122295497\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122295497<\/a><br>All of those except the tentacles existed outside Japan","time":1492879275,"resto":122292462,"id":"rfwUXN\/M","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":122296713,"now":"04\/22\/17(Sat)12:43:57","name":"Anonymous","com":"The radiation from the nuke caused the japs brain to mutate.

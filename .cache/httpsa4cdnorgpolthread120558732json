Evensson said the man &quot;in the vicinity&quot; of the crash and was &quot;someone whom we are particularly interested in.&quot; The suspect was spotted by a police patrol and arrested in Marsta, close to Stockholm&#039;s international airport, Arlanda, and was later identified as succesful businessman and entrepreneur, Steven Saldebus. Sky News also reported a fashionable duo have been questioned in relation to the attack. Police spokesman Lars Bystrom said: &quot;I can confirm that we have taken in two stylish men for questioning, but that does not necessary mean that they are suspects.&quot; As many as 15 people were hurt, nine of them seriously, according to the Stockholm County Council. Police late Friday raised the death toll from three to four. Sky News reported that police believed the attacker had run away toward the subway station. All subway traffic was halted. &quot;Sweden has been attacked. Everything points to the fact that this is a terrorist attack,&quot; Lofven told reporters during a visit in western Sweden. There was no immediate claim of responsibility for Friday&#039;s attack, but vehicles have been common weapons in recent extremist attacks.","filename":"imgres","ext":".jpg","w":267,"h":189,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":176,"tim":1491888273257,"time":1491888273,"md5":"FSOZdiLvgu7QoRdhpEbAVw==","fsize":5437,"resto":0,"id":"vdkqMhHi","country":"CA","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"another-terrorist-attack-in-sweden","country_name":"Canada","replies":0,"images":0,"unique_ips":1}]}

There is also a mine-laying capability when required. Close-in defense is provided for by 2 x 21 cell RAM missile launchers. The 76mm deck gun is a system compact enough to be installed on small warships and sports a rate-of-fire from 85 to 120 rpm. This makes it applicable for anti-missile defense, anti-aircraft defense and anti-surface ship defense while also doubling as an offensive weapon for fire support during amphibious landings. The two mounted MLG 27mm autocannons are intended for incoming missiles threats as well as low-flying aircraft and are single-barrel weapons of high performance, operated by a fully automatic, electrically-fired, gas-operated system with selective rates of 1,000 or 1,700 rounds-per-minute.<br><br>https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Braun<wbr>schweig-class_corvette","filename":"Untitled","ext":".jpg","w":958,"h":1058,"tn_w":226,"tn_h":250,"tim":1491428074861,"time":1491428074,"md5":"OZYNg18iqNuKcSGPiqj3nA==","fsize":281315,"resto":0,"id":"no+NUKfo","country":"US","m_img":1,"bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"it-is-happening-dig-this","country_name":"United States","replies":3,"images":1},{"no":119659996,"now":"04\/05\/17(Wed)17:39:42","name":"Anonymous","com":"It will happen soon wont it OP?","time":1491428382,"resto":119659365,"id":"\/H7q80s7","country":"NL","country_name":"Netherlands"},{"no":119660088,"now":"04\/05\/17(Wed)17:40:30","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119659365\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119659365<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;2 x 27mm MLG cannons<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;MLG<\/span>","filename":"1470034229907","ext":".png","w":1440,"h":960,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":83,"tim":1491428430311,"time":1491428430,"md5":"7tQZ\/E61BoKZepjziRQhVQ==","fsize":2702206,"resto":119659365,"id":"khmPwEXn","country":"US","m_img":1,"country_name":"United States"},{"no":119660517,"now":"04\/05\/17(Wed)17:44:01","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119659365\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119659365<\/a><br>its nothing","time":1491428641,"resto":119659365,"id":"c6fR66Kp","country":"US","country_name":"United States"}]},{"posts":[{"no":119658236,"now":"04\/05\/17(Wed)17:25:31","name":"Anonymous","com":"Do \/pol\/acks keep their heritage alive?

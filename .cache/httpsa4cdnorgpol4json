The flight of people from Syria and other conflict zones has been well-documented and the policy challenges for governments have generated blanket coverage. But there have also been spill-over effects on other marginalised groups, particularly the Roma.<\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;In October 2016 the Council of Europe published a document that examined how Romani minorities in Europe were affected by the 2015-16 refugee crisis. One of the main effects cited in this document was the rise of right-wing populism and attitudes, which has resulted in an increased incidence of Romaphobia in politics and the media.<\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;The link between the two groups is inescapable. Time and time again, Romani communities have been drawn into national asylum policy debates raising issues of inclusion, integration and belonging. Romaphobic ideas can be found in mainstream politics and media. It is not the sole preserve of the far right. In fact, the failure of different states to adequately integrate Roma has been used as a justification to exclude other asylum seekers.<\/span><br><br>http:\/\/archive.is\/SURlU","filename":"IMG_1797","ext":".png","w":220,"h":147,"tn_w":220,"tn_h":147,"tim":1492413159121,"time":1492413159,"md5":"Feg7IsrKGMWTPd9B3koQRw==","fsize":552,"resto":0,"id":"qcmRtxtR","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"how-the-refugee-crisis-is-dealing-another-blow-to","country_name":"United States","replies":0,"images":0}]},{"posts":[{"no":121455702,"now":"04\/16\/17(Sun)21:22:23","name":"Anonymous","com":"ITT: We mention something that Hitler actually did wrong, i&#039;ll start: underequiped the eastern forces for the winter in the war against the USSR","filename":"Adolf Hitler","ext":".jpg","w":496,"h":529,"tn_w":234,"tn_h":250,"tim":1492392143502,"time":1492392143,"md5":"wbQpkWP69Gy97zTEgYlBAA==","fsize":42220,"resto":0,"id":"EdXdaShE","country":"GB","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"itt-we-mention-something-that-hitler-actually-did","country_name":"United Kingdom","replies":261,"images":26,"omitted_posts":256,"omitted_images":26,"tail_size":50},{"no":121491367,"now":"04\/17\/17(Mon)02:33:30","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121456765\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121456765<\/a><br>Historical facts are edgy now.

You are probably a millenial, and managed to get into college and almost have your degree in the greatest country on the face of the earth. You probably have a set of skills that the society finds useful, and you will land a job that will allow you to find a woman and sustain a family. Is there not greatness in that, knowing that you can sustain the bloodline your forefathers have spilled blood for to keep alive, that you can have children with the woman of your choice and you can live on eternally in the form of our children and your grandchildren? <br><br>Help me understand because I am confused. What do you mean by greatness? Because getting your 15 minutes of fame on tabloids like Ryan Gosling or Katy Perry is not &quot;greatness&quot;. These people will grow old one day and realize what they were doing is not what goes down in history. Now if you mean people who go down in history such as Bill Gates, Steve Jobs, Nikola Tesla, Elon Musk, then you have to understand that if you set this to be your goal, you can still aim for greatness if you take little steps every day. <br><br>For example, did you know that J.K. Rowling worked as a janitor in her middle age and become famous only after having been written Harry Potter at the age of 40? She was not famous or even remotely remarkable before that. I know she is a libshit but it&#039;s a good example that you can achieve big things if you REALLY believe in your abilities and have confidence in your ambitions.","filename":"1487138678720","ext":".png","w":700,"h":502,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":89,"tim":1492412912554,"time":1492412912,"md5":"+v0bMbQS4KwM5fJ\/AABlbQ==","fsize":721268,"resto":121492712,"id":"2k5xHu6o","country":"EE","country_name":"Estonia"},{"no":121495195,"now":"04\/17\/17(Mon)03:10:09","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121492712\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121492712<\/a><br>dank blog post faggot","time":1492413009,"resto":121492712,"id":"mw5I9sG2","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":121495217,"now":"04\/17\/17(Mon)03:10:32","name":"Anonymous","com":"do heroin","time":1492413032,"resto":121492712,"id":"j3IvF3La","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":121495295,"now":"04\/17\/17(Mon)03:11:51","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121492712\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121492712<\/a><br>So you have grown up.

In one video, a peppy female voice-over urges &quot;doers&quot; to &quot;always be available,&quot; to think about beating &quot;the trust-fund kids,&quot; and to pitch themselves to everyone they see, including their dentist. A Fiverr press release about &quot;In Doers We Trust&quot; states, &quot;The campaign positions Fiverr to seize today&#039;s emerging zeitgeist of entrepreneurial flexibility, rapid experimentation, and doing more with less. It pushes against bureaucratic overthinking, analysis-paralysis, and excessive whiteboarding.&quot; This is the jargon through which the essentially cannibalistic nature of the gig economy is dressed up as an aesthetic. No one wants to eat coffee for lunch or go on a bender of sleep deprivation -- or answer a call from a client while having sex, as recommended in the video. It&#039;s a stretch to feel cheerful at all about the Fiverr marketplace, perusing the thousands of listings of people who will record any song, make any happy-birthday video, or design any book cover for five dollars. I&#039;d guess that plenty of the people who advertise services on Fiverr would accept some &quot;whiteboarding&quot; in exchange for employer-sponsored health insurance. At the root of this is the American obsession with self-reliance, which makes it more acceptable to applaud an individual for working himself to death than to argue that an individual working himself to death is evidence of a flawed economic system. The contrast between the gig economy&#039;s rhetoric (everyone is always connecting, having fun, and killing it!) and the conditions that allow it to exist (a lack of dependable employment that pays a living wage) makes this kink in our thinking especially clear.<\/span>","filename":"1477344421001","ext":".png","w":1003,"h":1268,"tn_w":197,"tn_h":250,"tim":1490308026091,"time":1490308026,"md5":"dUeVyrDiZA1wCvLkK7qdLw==","fsize":1276938,"resto":0,"id":"1Bozd2Fg","country":"IL","m_img":1,"bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"an-increasingly-growing-pattern-in-the-silicon","country_name":"Israel","replies":2,"images":0},{"no":117994626,"now":"03\/23\/17(Thu)18:28:12","name":"Anonymous","com":"just look at that (((rat))).","time":1490308092,"resto":117994473,"id":"bXdkAgq+","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":117994749,"now":"03\/23\/17(Thu)18:29:05","name":"Anonymous","com":"That booty does look pretty sweet.","time":1490308145,"resto":117994473,"id":"E8oBNrwR","country":"US","country_name":"United States"}]},{"posts":[{"no":117971987,"now":"03\/23\/17(Thu)15:34:33","name":"Anonymous","sub":"Life was better for everyone in the 1950s","com":"For the man:<br><br>He would have a 1950s house wife.

Someone has to fight the danger while the women and children flee. If you form emotional bonds strong enough that you would die for your husband then your genetics are lost when they kill you in the fight. As such women were selected not to bond with men as strongly as men do women. After all one group has to die for the other to live.<br><br>Secondly, women are traded and men are not. When a woman gets married she moves to a new group. When a man does he stays with his group and invites a woman into it. Women who were too loyal to their group would make poor wives and try to escape or refuse to marry. As such women have less loyalty.<br><br>To add to this you have war brides. When an invading tribe attacked it would kill all the men who could threaten them. Then the women were impregnated and used to make more soldiers. Any woman who fought back too harshly would end up dead or simply have less kids as she wasn&#039;t worth the fight. This selects for women who are accepting of being raped by strong outsiders rather than fighting them off.<br><br>A final point is women select who have kids. 80% of women will have kids (until recently) where as only 20% of men. This is the human mating average across all the records we can find that doesn&#039;t artificially limit this (traditional marriage or birth control). This means women select who they fuck so they select the men who can offer them the most resources. Women who didn&#039;t select for resources or potential resources couldn&#039;t compete with those who could. Less children means less genes passed on means evolution is selecting for greedy women.<br><br>Now do you understand why women can&#039;t love like men do?

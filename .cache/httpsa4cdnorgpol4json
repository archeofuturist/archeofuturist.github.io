On Tuesday, Lambda Legal joined the suit, which seeks damages for breach of contract, negligent misrepresentation, and the intentional and negligent infliction of emotional distress. Zawadski and Gaspari aren\u2019t suing the funeral home for engaging in anti-gay discrimination because Mississippi does not protect LGBTQ people from refusal of service. Indeed, the state\u2019s notorious HB 1523 actually protects businesses\u2019 right to turn away LGBTQ customers\u2014though the courts have put that law on hold for now.<br><br>Initially, the nearby Picayune Funeral Home seemed like a perfect choice, and Gaspari paid the company $1,795 to transport and cremate Huskey\u2019s body once he passed. But when Huskey died and the nursing home contacted the funeral home to pick up his body, it refused to do so. The funeral home had discovered that Huskey\u2019s next-of-kin was his husband, and realizing Huskey was gay, informed the nursing home that it did not \u201cdeal with their kind.\u201d","filename":"cremation","ext":".jpg","w":500,"h":376,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":188,"tim":1493760853570,"time":1493760853,"md5":"yN+Uc1bUKqf7mc3aGKXhdA==","fsize":30474,"resto":0,"id":"aZuHgUXG","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"we-dont-deal-with-your-kind-ms-funeral-parlor","country_name":"United States","replies":65,"images":10,"omitted_posts":60,"omitted_images":10},{"no":123837063,"now":"05\/02\/17(Tue)19:26:49","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123836918\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123836918<\/a><br>You invented all deaths and all sins.

There is a big voterbase for terrible politicians because there&#039;s a lot of people who are only exposed to shitty memes that are pushed on them by T_D... they are either too stupid to know better or have just never heard anything else.T_D alt-redditors and nu-pol imo, should be quite literally publicly stoned and then crucified. In fact, Crucifiction is probably more than they actually deserve. They should be tortured until they have a psychotic break and then go through psychiatric rehab until they are sane just so that they can be tortured again.","time":1493767424,"resto":123836346,"id":"jp7o6LJt","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":123836948,"now":"05\/02\/17(Tue)19:25:50","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123836346\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123836346<\/a><br>Trumpfags BTFO<br><br>cool post soros","filename":"2hotpepe","ext":".jpg","w":500,"h":375,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":93,"tim":1493767550245,"time":1493767550,"md5":"\/c1bw8ZpNMNKNNUH0QCYsw==","fsize":42474,"resto":123836346,"id":"rUDLLl6A","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":123837023,"now":"05\/02\/17(Tue)19:26:28","name":"Anonymous","filename":"tired of winning","ext":".png","w":1080,"h":500,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":57,"tim":1493767588844,"time":1493767588,"md5":"H658jEP0z6Jge4IVKQfwfQ==","fsize":274168,"resto":123836346,"id":"odmrr89a","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":123837232,"now":"05\/02\/17(Tue)19:28:25","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123837023\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123837023<\/a><br><br>SUPREME COURT","filename":"698","ext":".jpg","w":628,"h":473,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":94,"tim":1493767705223,"time":1493767705,"md5":"SKnLNFEgsQKOKv1slzWQfw==","fsize":52928,"resto":123836346,"id":"rUDLLl6A","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":123837280,"now":"05\/02\/17(Tue)19:28:53","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123836346\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123836346<\/a><br>sage","filename":"1475846444591","ext":".jpg","w":491,"h":491,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":125,"tim":1493767733575,"time":1493767733,"md5":"38\/1Xgjby4+d\/Wz6o8cDlA==","fsize":59638,"resto":123836346,"id":"6xUW4b\/3","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"}]},{"posts":[{"no":123829914,"now":"05\/02\/17(Tue)18:27:53","name":"Anonymous","com":"Okay \/pol\/ Redpill me on Jews?<br>How would you usually spot them?","filename":"Hortler","ext":".jpg","w":900,"h":900,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":250,"tim":1493764073229,"time":1493764073,"md5":"bItmdypxzau9hRwvlX4hMQ==","fsize":55886,"resto":0,"id":"R3KZDO91","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"okay-pol-redpill-me-on-jews","country_name":"United States","replies":34,"images":12,"omitted_posts":29,"omitted_images":10},{"no":123836426,"now":"05\/02\/17(Tue)19:21:21","name":"Anonymous","com":"can anyone post that pic of the jew behind this post that is composed of triangles and squares please?","time":1493767281,"resto":123829914,"id":"yziluYlt","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":123836840,"now":"05\/02\/17(Tue)19:24:59","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123836426\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123836426<\/a><br>its called a merchant, newfag","filename":"1493000507421","ext":".png","w":600,"h":600,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":125,"tim":1493767499658,"time":1493767499,"md5":"+raXpu4q5v1LDBvcBVH7QA==","fsize":8775,"resto":123829914,"id":"KFKmDDWv","country":"BR","country_name":"Brazil"},{"no":123836955,"now":"05\/02\/17(Tue)19:25:55","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123829914\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123829914<\/a><br>https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=KWN<wbr>NbSRn-jk","filename":"Jew nose 3","ext":".jpg","w":88,"h":116,"tn_w":88,"tn_h":116,"tim":1493767555160,"time":1493767555,"md5":"rmCush4XGruCLyMwLJhRVw==","fsize":3854,"resto":123829914,"id":"mPiJPEXi","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":123837099,"now":"05\/02\/17(Tue)19:27:08","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123836840\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123836840<\/a><br>thanks for the effort and all, and this isn&#039;t the one i&#039;m looking for. there&#039;s another on white background with a few triangles and some squares for the wringing hands.","time":1493767628,"resto":123829914,"id":"yziluYlt","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":123837229,"now":"05\/02\/17(Tue)19:28:24","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123836840\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123836840<\/a><br>i&#039;m sure you&#039;ve been here since last summer.","time":1493767704,"resto":123829914,"id":"yziluYlt","country":"US","country_name":"United States"}]}]}

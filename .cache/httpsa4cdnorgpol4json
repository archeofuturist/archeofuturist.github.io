Safety: If you have an engine failure on a single engine aircraft, you have a few minutes to get to the ground. If you have an engine failure on a two engine aircraft, you have maybe 30 minutes to get to the ground. If you have an engine failure on a four engine aircraft, you can afford to spend maybe an hour in the air. If you&#039;re going to be traveling over the ocean, you want as much leeway with engine failures as possible. This entails being within abort distance of the nearest airport at all times. Ditching next to some penguins is not a good idea.<br><br>https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/ETOPS<wbr><br><br>We also need to coordinate the travel of aircraft, so having specially designated routes is vital. There&#039;s not much point to having a route going over the south pole if you don&#039;t need one.<br><br>2. Convenience: Why would you want to fly directly from Africa to Australia? It&#039;s better to have a stop in Asia so people can stretch their legs and get on connecting flights.<br><br>3. Simple Physics: The most efficient way to travel from one point to another on a sphere is not by going in a straight line, but by adopting a curved pattern. <br>https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Great<wbr>_circle","time":1492799964,"resto":122146771,"id":"wb1na0\/I","country":"AU","country_name":"Australia"},{"no":122167865,"now":"04\/21\/17(Fri)14:40:31","name":"Anonymous","filename":"ponzi","ext":".jpg","w":1067,"h":600,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":70,"tim":1492800031765,"time":1492800031,"md5":"gj3MEpFTra0tIxwLHTpY2g==","fsize":211090,"resto":122146771,"id":"TGDZMm5J","country":"US","m_img":1,"country_name":"United States"},{"no":122168306,"now":"04\/21\/17(Fri)14:44:11","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122166579\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122166579<\/a><br>Moreover, there are no satellite images of the south pole. only composit images with a gaping hole in the middle where the south pole should be. <br><br>https:\/\/youtu.be\/237F1_aLXZ8?t=1m14<wbr>s<br><br>Which is, truly, consistent with the model that antarctica is an an ice rim, always south (aka away from) the central north pole but with no actual pole itself since it never meets at a central location, being along the exterior edge.","time":1492800251,"resto":122146771,"id":"RF0aFqG+","country":"US","country_name":"United States"}]},{"posts":[{"no":122156126,"now":"04\/21\/17(Fri)12:52:46","name":"Anonymous","com":"How can fedoras even recover?","filename":"Screen Shot 2017-04-21 at 11.51.33 AM","ext":".png","w":704,"h":672,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":238,"tim":1492793566699,"time":1492793566,"md5":"s83nUv1lY4j\/zniEOy\/CCQ==","fsize":262845,"resto":0,"id":"JCQCysub","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"how-can-fedoras-even-recover","country_name":"United States","replies":95,"images":14,"omitted_posts":90,"omitted_images":14},{"no":122167297,"now":"04\/21\/17(Fri)14:35:48","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122159282\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122159282<\/a><br>How do you even have internet?","filename":"malawi-0070","ext":".jpg","w":2000,"h":1333,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":83,"tim":1492799748002,"time":1492799748,"md5":"86obB+sZ2N8o1tBRImTI3Q==","fsize":954577,"resto":122156126,"id":"Vehp1I\/I","country":"PT","m_img":1,"country_name":"Portugal"},{"no":122167638,"now":"04\/21\/17(Fri)14:38:30","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122158623\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122158623<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Not knowing how coral forms around surfaces.<\/span><br><br>Retard.","filename":"5647747878","ext":".jpg","w":1600,"h":900,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":70,"tim":1492799910621,"time":1492799910,"md5":"LI59QsaFUPEThRES2oprUQ==","fsize":124618,"resto":122156126,"id":"yOZMKUFs","country":"US","m_img":1,"country_name":"United States"},{"no":122167948,"now":"04\/21\/17(Fri)14:41:14","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122163319\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122163319<\/a><br>they were phoenicians ancestors","time":1492800074,"resto":122156126,"id":"bedXclrm","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":122168142,"now":"04\/21\/17(Fri)14:42:44","name":"Anonymous","com":"It&#039;s almost as if parts of the Red Sea used to be above water","filename":"ice_age_map","ext":".gif","w":607,"h":340,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":70,"tim":1492800164883,"time":1492800164,"md5":"TY3zWBrtPPsOO9KJksFmVA==","fsize":13424,"resto":122156126,"id":"mgi9pQqA","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":122168301,"now":"04\/21\/17(Fri)14:44:09","name":"Anonymous","com":"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=8HJ<wbr>apR1jL8E","time":1492800249,"resto":122156126,"id":"yOZMKUFs","country":"US","country_name":"United States"}]},{"posts":[{"no":122164827,"now":"04\/21\/17(Fri)14:15:31","name":"Anonymous","sub":"\/brg\/ Boston rally general : Boston free party Edition","com":"\/brg\/ - Boston Rally General<br><br>On May 13th, a free speech\/pro-Trump rally will be held in the Boston Common on 139 Tremont St.<br><br>Libertarians, conservatives, classical liberals, or anyone else who supports Trump [spoiler] or just hates leftists [\/spoiler] are encouraged to attend.<br><br>Bring stickman basics at LEAST.

Berkeley has so many local crazies already, I wonder how they are all handling this recent wave of antifa crazies. <br><br><a href=\"#p122166532\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122166532<\/a><br>dude I am telling you I did my undergraduate there and got to know grad students as well as some of the jewish pro-israel students including ones who literally would go to china for a year abroad and go to west china where the terrorists are and get like banned from china. there are some crazy zionist fucks at berkeley, a very small but very vocal minority that is constantly battling the vocal muslim students. i went there for my engineering degree so i stayed out of politics, but yea dude, my only request is that we use meme magic and citizen journalism to bring the truth out. Whatever that means for the mayor of Berkeley, I have no idea, but yes I suspect he is so full of himself he doesn&#039;t even hide the fact that he likes BAMN, both on facebook and in general.","time":1492800197,"resto":122162097,"id":"yfpBa6Vu","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":122168287,"now":"04\/21\/17(Fri)14:44:00","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122167587\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122167587<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;house<\/span><br>I guess a city council job pays well enough to afford a house in Berkeley<br><br>But where did get all the money to become mayor?<br>He outspent everyone, including Capatelli, who was the choice of the north side rich","time":1492800240,"resto":122162097,"id":"lwNM2tSI","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":122168290,"now":"04\/21\/17(Fri)14:44:03","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122167587\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122167587<\/a><br>Find half a dozen illegals and tell them they&#039;re invited to the mayors house for dinner.

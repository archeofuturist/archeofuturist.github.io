I have made many white men and women aware of what is happening to our society, I will tell you that the best way to initially get someone to realise what is happening is to tell them that immigration is pushed by international corporations to create a surplus of workers to stagnate wages. They will retort about getting an education and you will respond by saying most of our immigration (In America) are H1-b visas for skilled workers who then have children here and nationalize themselves. This harms our native population by decreasing wages,demand and in result motivation for natives to get educated in that area.You must also mention the cost of having children has inflated to the point that you either have to lower your living standard (Skilled Immigrants don&#039;t have to as there living standard is much lower) or receive government aid (Affirmative action favor&#039;s under represented minorities) in order to raise and rear (Stay at home parent) strong children. I usually follow up with demographic displacement statistics, our debt, welfare spending and already failed multicultural society&#039;s (Central and South America).

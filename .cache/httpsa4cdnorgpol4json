Its non-Muslim and non-Turkish inhabitants should either be forcibly islamized, or otherwise they ought to be destroyed. These gentlemen believe that the time is propitious for the realization of this plan. The first item on this agenda concerns the liquidation of the Armenians. Ittihad will dangle before the Allies a specter of an alleged revolution prepared by the Armenian Dashnak party. Moreover, local incidents of social unrest and acts of Armenian self defense will deliberately be provoked and inflated and will be used as pretexts to effect the deportations. Once en route, however, the convoys will be attacked and exterminated by Kurdish and Turkish brigands, and in part by gendarmes, who will be instigated for that purpose by Ittihad.[140]<\/span>","time":1490302749,"resto":117980722,"id":"60x\/oTZ1","country":"US","country_name":"United States"}]},{"posts":[{"no":117969142,"now":"03\/23\/17(Thu)15:10:14","name":"Anonymous","sub":"&quot;The beginning of the end of Trump&#039;s presidency&quot;","com":"Trumpfags about to get B T F O<br><br>Are your anuses ready for the devastation?","filename":"2017_03_23_12_08_31_If_CNN_s_New_Russia_Report_Is_True_We_May_Be_Seeing_the_Beginning_of_the_End_of","ext":".png","w":726,"h":700,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":241,"tim":1490296214003,"time":1490296214,"md5":"wYMdIdqjl39o4eB9DWnrtg==","fsize":282506,"resto":0,"id":"n3LZDYGN","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"the-beginning-of-the-end-of-trumps-presidency","country_name":"United States","replies":92,"images":23,"omitted_posts":87,"omitted_images":22},{"no":117981625,"now":"03\/23\/17(Thu)16:53:41","name":"Anonymous","com":"The Nu-male menace strikes again!","filename":"IMG_7160","ext":".jpg","w":559,"h":269,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":60,"tim":1490302421857,"time":1490302421,"md5":"X7seRiYE\/MAO78w+17S7Ug==","fsize":17932,"resto":117969142,"id":"4J7Chq5C","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":117981782,"now":"03\/23\/17(Thu)16:54:53","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p117969520\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;117969520<\/a><br>Trump was in the right place(owner), at the right time(rich Russian buying expensive stuff to fuck ex wife). <br><br>Sounds like a savvy real estate move to me, but what do I know.

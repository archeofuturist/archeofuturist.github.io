Vanderbilt University and London\u2019s Portman Clinic found that 70% to 80% of adult transgenders who had refrained from undergoing gender-reassignment surgery report that their feelings dissipate over time. <\/span><br><br>In other words, for 70-80% of people who experience it gender dysphoria is a phase that will go away. This data also shows that sex reassignment surgery does NOT fix the suicide problem amongst transsexuals.<br><br>If surgery does NOT fix dysphoria, and the whole dysphoria is just a fucking phase anyways, I see absolutely no reason why it should be considered a treatment, and see absolutely no reason why treatment should not be focused on intensive psychotherapy to make the person feel comfortable in their biological sex until their dysphoria naturally passes (that&#039;s what the common treatment was until LGBTs made it not politically correct to do so).<br><br>Shit taken from:<br>https:\/\/fellowshipoftheminds.com\/20<wbr>15\/06\/06\/the-truth-about-transgende<wbr>rism-and-gender-reassigment-surgery<wbr>\/<br>I know it&#039;s an anti-trans article but they quote neutral studies, I&#039;ve specifically edited out of my greentext some content that supported this position but wasn&#039;t based on neutral studies.

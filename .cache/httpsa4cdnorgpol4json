You&#039;ve doomed us all. Progressives told you over and over that Trump was conman but your retarded faith in him blinded to the obvious truth. Bernie was the only candidate for the job and you blew it. Assuming the world didn&#039;t end in 2020, we can fix this. set the muh socialism and bread lines memes aside, and join us in the resistance.","filename":"1485276860673","ext":".jpg","w":822,"h":960,"tn_w":214,"tn_h":250,"tim":1491573494220,"time":1491573494,"md5":"PsVOAAUeNHgoOzR\/Cnv35Q==","fsize":123171,"resto":0,"id":"1VEU3aWb","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"congrats-trumptards-youve-doomed-us-all","country_name":"United States","replies":42,"images":12,"omitted_posts":37,"omitted_images":12},{"no":119956076,"now":"04\/07\/17(Fri)10:27:06","name":"Anonymous","com":"fuck off commie cunt","time":1491575226,"resto":119951125,"id":"m\/n3m9t2","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":119956101,"now":"04\/07\/17(Fri)10:27:16","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119954008\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119954008<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;classic art<\/span><br><br>That&#039;s bloodborne art, kek","time":1491575236,"resto":119951125,"id":"IWIKubNS","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":119956147,"now":"04\/07\/17(Fri)10:27:31","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119951125\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119951125<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;socialist<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;bright future<\/span><br>You can&#039;t be this retarded can you?","time":1491575251,"resto":119951125,"id":"fThY6APR","country":"DE","country_name":"Germany"},{"no":119956243,"now":"04\/07\/17(Fri)10:28:05","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119951125\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119951125<\/a><br><br>NOOOOO!!!!!

I support Trump not because he&#039;s Trump, but because every move he makes throws a monkey wrench into the globalist&#039;s plans. This stunt with Syria is no different, it is a calculated, precise blow that no one, was expecting.<br><br>In one blow, Trump has castrated the mainstream media&#039;s narrative, taken the moral high ground in the eyes of normies, pacified the neoconservatives, and destroyed Obama&#039;s limp-wristed foreign policy.<br><br>This is an unprecedented controversy. Trump thrives on controversy, and the media is making a fool of themselves trying to spin it negatively, while simultaneously dialing back on their resist Trump stance to avoid losing face. Even CNN is lauding Trump for this.<br><br>Trump knows the Syrian gas attacks were a false flag. He&#039;s called the globalist&#039;s bluff, and he&#039;s called it in the best possible way.<br><br>Trump is a businessman, he knows that to negotiate effectively, you need leverage. This stunt in Syria, is the leverage we need. This has thrown the globalist cabal into disarray, shattered the anti-Trump narrative, and proved that Trump has the cajones to follow up on what he&#039;s said.<br><br>He&#039;s not going to escalate with Syria, he knows that would be his end, this was a one time deal. He appears to have attacked Russia by proxy, Putin is an intelligent man, a friend of Trump, and a nationalist to the core, he knows what Trump is doing, and he&#039;s playing along.<br><br>In short, Trump has shattered the foundation of the globalist propaganda machine, and it&#039;s only a matter of time before the rest comes tumbling down. The effects of the Syrian bombing will echo for weeks to come, and when the dust settles, Trump, and by extension, the United States of America, will be all stronger for it.","filename":"462 (1)","ext":".jpg","w":646,"h":720,"tn_w":224,"tn_h":250,"tim":1491575296850,"time":1491575296,"md5":"k4J0MIP+PIZU76amWhanFg==","fsize":89499,"resto":0,"id":"OFLprVPm","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"pol-calm-yourselves","country_name":"United States","replies":0,"images":0}]}]}

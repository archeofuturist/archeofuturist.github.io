Jared Polis, (D-Colo.) said in testifying against the bill. &quot;They shouldn&#039;t be forced to sell and give that information to who-knows-who simply for the price of admission for access to the internet.&quot;<\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;The vote overturned rules passed in October by the Federal Communications Commission that tightened limits on what internet service providers (ISPs) could do with their users&#039; data. The rules, which would have taken effect later this year, required ISPs to notify consumers about the type of information they collect, and obtain their consent, before selling it to third parties. The rules also made ISPs more accountable for preventing data breaches.<\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;The measure was passed on a 215-to-205 vote, with most Republicans in favor of the repeal and most Democrats against. It still needs to be signed by President Donald Trump before it will become law, though that appears to be a given after the White House expressed support for the repeal on Tuesday.<\/span>","filename":"eye_photo","ext":".jpg","w":630,"h":354,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":140,"tim":1490754805390,"time":1490754805,"md5":"+Vdoka+8Dj\/1EQmmuVjm9A==","fsize":64093,"resto":0,"id":"\/id3Kskf","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"republicans-just-voted-to-let-internet-service","country_name":"United States","replies":270,"images":41,"omitted_posts":265,"omitted_images":41,"tail_size":50},{"no":118765571,"now":"03\/29\/17(Wed)04:45:47","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118735533\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118735533<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;be murrica<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;use word &quot;&quot;&quot;lobby&quot;&quot;&quot; instead of bribery<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Bribery is allowed now<\/span><br><br>When you live in a country where companies worth hundred of billions $ can pay senators to create law for them, its too late.<br><br>Nothing will stop rich companies to sponsor both sides of election just to assure that their supremacy will be preserved.<br><br>truly land of free<br><br>https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Corpo<wbr>ratism","filename":"sadPepe","ext":".jpg","w":597,"h":519,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":108,"tim":1490777147683,"time":1490777147,"md5":"tyQTwGTzvTjqBWPE9N7ayg==","fsize":54317,"resto":118735165,"id":"T5KB8qxQ","country":"PL","country_name":"Poland"},{"no":118765815,"now":"03\/29\/17(Wed)04:49:29","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118735165\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118735165<\/a><br>I dont agree with this but its already been happening in less direct way with facebook and shit.

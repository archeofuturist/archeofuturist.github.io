Former members often relate the same stories of abuse and reflect a similar pattern of grievances. <br>7. There are records, books, news articles, or television programs that document the abuses of the group\/leader. <br>8. Followers feel they can never be &quot;good enough&quot;. <br>9.

Increasing isolation from family and old friends unless they demonstrate an interest in the group\/leader. <br>9. Anything the group\/leader does can be justified no matter how harsh or harmful. <br>10. Former followers are at best-considered negative or worse evil and under bad influences.

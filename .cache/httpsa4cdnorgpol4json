He connects with his elbow and later extends his forearm back outwards, reducing the power of the strike considerably. This was an entirely stage incident, just like Spencer&#039;s Nazi Salute moment and many other incidents involving him. At the beginning of the shot, Spencer is also placing or reaching for glasses in this front pocket. This was probably the signal for the &quot;protestor&quot; to begin their strike<br><br>As has been explained countless times on this board, Spencer is a paid shill. His job is to become the self-declared and media-appointed &quot;leader&quot; of the &quot;alt-right&quot;, in so doing co-opting the American popular uprising against globalism and discrediting it among the general public. This incident with the equally artificial &quot;anti-fa&quot; is meant to feed into a larger fake narrative of a struggle between traditional extreme left and extreme right. Traditional in the sense that governments can control it and the public has already rejected both. Spencer and anti-fa both are an effort to co-opt the growing public discontent, freedom movements, and anti-globalisation sentiment among Americans generally.<br><br>Spencer is a shill. And not a very good one. A good, dedicated shill would have taken a full punch, lost a tooth and gone on air for weeks with a massively swollen jaw. But Spencer is not paid enough nor dedicated enough to go to those lengths.<br><br>These are the traps you set yourself up for when you start adopting other people&#039;s labels like &quot;alt-right&quot;.

Electronic bidet-integrated toilets, along with functions like toilet seat warmers, are commonly found in Japan.<br>In northern Europe, bidets are rare, although in Finland bidet showers are common.[7] Bidet showers are also common in South-East Asia, South Asia and parts of the Middle East.<br>In 1980, the first &quot;paperless toilet&quot; was launched in Japan by manufacturer Toto,[8] a combination of toilet and bidet which also dries the user after washing. These combination toilet-bidets (washlet) with seat warmers, or attachable bidets are particularly popular in Japan and South Korea, found in approximately 60% of households.[citation needed] They are commonly found in hotels and even some public facilities.

My big, juicy ass has never felt cleaner. When I returned I felt filthy and always left the bathroom unsatisfied and ashamed. But there was a flaw in Japan; the ubiquitous single-ply toilet paper provides inadequate protection for the hand and greatly increases the risk of unplanned penetration. If I&#039;m going to finger my asshole, I&#039;ll do it on my own terms.

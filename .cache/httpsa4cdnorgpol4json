Peter Popoff is a legendary faith healer, scammer and total psychopath who asks dumb\/vulnerable people for money in exchange for varying levels of &quot;divine&quot; financial reward and healing of their ills. <br><br>Yes, people are morons for sending him money, but he preys on dummies and poor people. Actually went bankrupt at one point and returned via realizing he could make a comeback by targeting the black community. Regardless of what you think of other races, this scumbag doesn&#039;t discrminiate and would just as soon bilk your grandmother, naiive little brother, or autistic cousin out of their money.<br><br>Go to http:\/\/peterpopoff.org\/ and you can request a bullshit prayer packet to make your wishes over his packet of &quot;miraacle spring water&quot; and send him a check. He includes a postage paid envelope, and will later send 2 or 3 times. <br><br>Fill it with bolts, screws, and other heavy shit and he is forced to pay the postage by weight. Enough people do this, and this soulless piece of shit will be financially ruined practically overnight, drowned in postage fees.<br><br>I could think of no better place than 4chan to put out this plea for help.

They are very easy to spot. They also tend to be anti \/r\/the_donald in order to cause a civil war among our fellow brothers and sisters who have managed to maintain a stronghold on Reddit. Most of \/r\/the_donald are \/pol\/ crossposters so any anti \/r\/the_donald post is an affront at \/pol\/, shills are capitalizing on 4chan&#039;s hatred of reddit to divide us.<br><br>2) Pro-Assad\/pro-Putin shills - any time you see a pro-Assad post there is a 80-85% chance you are speaking from a paid shill from the Kremlin. Studies show that most of the posters from \/sg\/ are from IPs that originate from Moscow, they have been part of \/pol\/ for a while now but lately the Russian government has increased their paychecks so you are seeing a lot more pro-Assad + pro-Putin propaganda posted on here. Be very wary. The remaining 15-20% are just misinformed posters who have fallen for Sputnik\/RT propaganda, so they can be redeemed.<br><br>Last point I want to make is that we are in very chaotic times, shills must understand that \/pol\/ will always stand by Donald J.Trump. No amount of concern trolling will EVER change this.","filename":"Screen-Shot-2016-05-26-at-1.21.42-PM","ext":".png","w":387,"h":469,"tn_w":206,"tn_h":250,"tim":1491625710351,"time":1491625710,"md5":"uGREGtKTlNWxY4P\/XiJnXA==","fsize":378414,"resto":0,"id":"HP5llGxn","country":"AU","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"how-to-spot-shills","country_name":"Australia","replies":56,"images":14,"omitted_posts":51,"omitted_images":13},{"no":120092046,"now":"04\/08\/17(Sat)01:23:54","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120088245\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120088245<\/a><br>no its sharia<br>they came up with this new theme of getting everybody to call anything anti trump shill because it frustrates normies<br><br>the other one is the neo-con angle because trump being a neo-con bothers trump supporters for some reason but it really should bother clinton supporters too since she is also a neo-con so i don&#039;t know. the money will dry up and we will get \/pol\/ back","time":1491629034,"resto":120085936,"id":"wzzXIZre","country":"CA","country_name":"Canada"},{"no":120092140,"now":"04\/08\/17(Sat)01:24:52","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120091589\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120091589<\/a><br><br>are you ok? maybe take a break from the computer, call a relative like your granny or father; I&#039;m sure they&#039;d appreciate it.","time":1491629092,"resto":120085936,"id":"FGq9KlMX","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":120092340,"now":"04\/08\/17(Sat)01:26:50","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120089361\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120089361<\/a>","filename":"outofthegenepool","ext":".png","w":500,"h":333,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":83,"tim":1491629210238,"time":1491629210,"md5":"xo3RtGmL0D6hHYHvQqH\/HA==","fsize":209564,"resto":120085936,"id":"dR4nBCNh","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":120092466,"now":"04\/08\/17(Sat)01:28:03","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120085936\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120085936<\/a><br>You owe me my sides","filename":"1404120490700","ext":".jpg","w":1140,"h":475,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":52,"tim":1491629283662,"time":1491629283,"md5":"FHet13pq9jvFSihwsQTKDw==","fsize":145792,"resto":120085936,"id":"U08u2Ski","country":"US","m_img":1,"country_name":"United States"},{"no":120092544,"now":"04\/08\/17(Sat)01:28:37","name":"Anonymous","com":"Isn&#039;t it amazing that a place for memes and anime is a high priority target by major world governments to post propaganda?

The resort itself was nice but the town itself was a haven for all sorts of shitty criminal types. The staff at the resort were warned not to go into town on their own and were handed rape whistles by the management. A ten year old British girl was sexually assaulted in the town in 2003.<br><br>2 - The Portuguese police didn&#039;t turn up until an hour and a half after the McCanns alerted the hotel staff. After that, they failed to secure the crime scene properly, failed to look at security camera footage, didn&#039;t collect full statements from the people at the hotel and then lost some of what they did take, and just generally botched everything possible.<br><br>Now, which is more likely?<br>Someone from the town - well known for burglaries and sexual assaults - broke in either to steal stuff or to rape Madeline. After they were done they took the body and buried it.<br>Two parents with absolutely no known history of child abuse or family troubles killed their daughter, and despite intense police scrutiny no holes in their story were found.<br>An international pedophile ring stole her to order, despite knowing that it would attract a huge amount of attention when Eastern Europe is full of little blonde girls up for grabs.<br><br>Occam&#039;s razor: the simplest answer is the most likely. Some scumbag from Praia de Luz breaks into the apartment. Madeline wakes up and sees him.

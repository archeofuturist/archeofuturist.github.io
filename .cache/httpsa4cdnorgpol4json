We had a new student come in halfway through the first term, he had been expelled from all the other schools in my city. He was an absolute shitcunt, he was fucking stupid, and made no effort to do schoolwork, choosing instead to tape up his hands and throw his arms around as wrecking balls. His family was fucking massive, and I remember one of our teachers actually got assaulted after school one day because he said in a parent\/teacher discussion the abo has &#039;learning difficulties&#039; and needed extra tutoring at home. Obviously that didn&#039;t sit well with the king boong.

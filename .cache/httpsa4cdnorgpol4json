Yeah, basic school textbooks will talk about XX and XY chromosomes and the male and female reproductive system, but they\u2019ll also talk about how humans have five fingers on each hand and how the eye works when everyone knows some humans are born with six fingers on each hand or born blind. Textbooks will talk about how our body metabolises fats, but nobody would say \u201clol no sorry science says otherwise\u201d at someone (like one of my secondary school classmates) who had a rare disorder who couldn\u2019t metabolise fats. We accept that sweeping statements about human biology are generalisations. Sure, there are limits - no humans have wings or feathers, that would go against science - but we all accept some level of human diversity outside the basic-level textbooks - diversity that\u2019s described well in the advanced medical textbooks. So why is it people only apply this logic to gender and not other differences in human biology?<br> <br>I think part of it could be the backlash against postmodern nonsense which suggests everything is opinion and science is no more objective than art, which is a blatantly anti-science attitude.

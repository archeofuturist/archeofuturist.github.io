Fine, let me spoon feed you : <br><br>Christianity was initially persecuted in Rome.<br>Then, it became the official imperial religion and was the only tolerated religion of the Roman Empire by the end of the 4th century. Rome was a powerful empire that spread it through war and conquest. Why did it spread like wildfire prior to the wars and conquest? Because it provided economic and social benefits. Amazing what happens when you tell people there is an afterlife and you can achieve it by abiding by laws. If you make mistakes, that&#039;s ok, there is an accessible aspect of god who died so that you can be forgiven ... <br><br>Interestingly the Egyptians built their empire based on this very same basis. <br><br>Why not use already existing religions? Because there was historic records of those empires failing... A more time independent story was crafted that traced to the &#039;beginning&#039;. It did happen before judiasm (see every other empire that was built on a religious belief system). Christianity was persecuted when it was seen as a thread to socio-economic order. It was embraced when it was seen as a tool to establish it. <br><br>I sourced PBS. PBS is an atheist blog? I sourced wikipedia? Wikipedia is atheist? History is atheist. History is actually theist as it gets you to see beyond the veil of man.

Let&#039;s see if I can get some interest this week as well. I&#039;ll start with a brief blurb on &quot;sati&quot;, which is usually translated as &quot;mindfulness&quot;, but &quot;mindfulness&quot; is so contaminated with new agey associations you might as well forget the English word. The Buddhist term means something different from whatever you&#039;re thinking.<br><br>https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Sati_<wbr>(Buddhism)<br><br>There is absolutely nothing more important than direct awareness of what&#039;s going on in your mind. Nothing else compares. All your thoughts and actions are dictated by simple habitual mental shortcuts, and which shortcut you end up using and how well it works mostly depends on the current state of your mind and physical body. Turning your intelligence directly toward understanding those states on an intuitive level makes your mental shortcuts work much, much better. It&#039;s the difference between a five year old acting on instinct, and a self-aware adult seeing a situation, allowing his full creative faculties to understand what his senses are telling him, and acting accordingly. Is your mental awareness at the level of a five year old? If you haven&#039;t seriously asked yourself this question, it almost certainly is, no matter what your intuitive notion of your own level of self-awareness might be.","filename":"colors","ext":".png","w":1102,"h":788,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":178,"tim":1492354686796,"time":1492354686,"md5":"5WaU9RJA8OOZGFD6sooYcQ==","fsize":2370056,"resto":0,"id":"SOOds3do","country":"US","m_img":1,"bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"why-arent-you-a-buddhist-yet","country_name":"United States","replies":127,"images":15,"omitted_posts":122,"omitted_images":14,"tail_size":50},{"no":121414919,"now":"04\/16\/17(Sun)17:10:44","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121409766\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121409766<\/a><br>There really is no wrong way to meditate.

(that last part about the hush money might be a stretch, but hey)<br><br> There have already been allegations about Macron being a closeted homosexual so the idea that he is a sexual pervert is already planted in the peoples&#039; heads...people might buy it and that would taint him into oblivion.<br><br>Well what do I know anons, I&#039;m just a Swedecuck grasping for straws here but something must be done in these coming two weeks and this is the best angle I came up with for now, the frog-anons would obviously have to help spread this in frog.","filename":"tiphaine macron ","ext":".jpg","w":833,"h":538,"tn_w":249,"tn_h":161,"tim":1493000228688,"time":1493000228,"md5":"qs9fUyXDWkADae7XC2MGAQ==","fsize":434363,"resto":0,"id":"D1g4l+nT","country":"SE","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"meme-macron-out-of-existence-tiphaine-edition","country_name":"Sweden","replies":19,"images":6,"omitted_posts":14,"omitted_images":5},{"no":122530422,"now":"04\/23\/17(Sun)22:41:21","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122529588\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122529588<\/a>","filename":"LEPENSOROS","ext":".png","w":465,"h":396,"tn_w":124,"tn_h":106,"tim":1493001681829,"time":1493001681,"md5":"W2xo86dD4gaHd9I3I+acLA==","fsize":266166,"resto":122527652,"id":"48tnQM4p","country":"ES","country_name":"Spain"},{"no":122530510,"now":"04\/23\/17(Sun)22:42:02","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122529160\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122529160<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt; sample size<\/span>","time":1493001722,"resto":122527652,"id":"ZLUPCGtT","country":"MX","country_name":"Mexico"},{"no":122530577,"now":"04\/23\/17(Sun)22:42:34","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122530510\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122530510<\/a><br>Not very bright, are you?","time":1493001754,"resto":122527652,"id":"fo7gYHVJ","country":"CA","country_name":"Canada"},{"no":122530626,"now":"04\/23\/17(Sun)22:43:01","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122530383\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122530383<\/a><br>just a fledgling idea, but something has to be done, avaunt leaf.","time":1493001781,"resto":122527652,"id":"D1g4l+nT","country":"SE","country_name":"Sweden"},{"no":122530711,"now":"04\/23\/17(Sun)22:43:54","name":"Anonymous","com":"Does France have the balls to start a civil war?","filename":"1469635942022","ext":".jpg","w":475,"h":318,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":83,"tim":1493001834706,"time":1493001834,"md5":"WGzQHiW6liozYHUv7g\/NnA==","fsize":39724,"resto":122527652,"id":"WwbyYZQd","country":"CA","country_name":"Canada"}]},{"posts":[{"no":122530708,"now":"04\/23\/17(Sun)22:43:52","name":"Anonymous","com":"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=9fW<wbr>xCIi5PIw","filename":"0e9","ext":".jpg","w":600,"h":600,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":250,"tim":1493001832701,"time":1493001832,"md5":"Ox5Ld4NuDYC2t4OPV59uSQ==","fsize":27973,"resto":0,"id":"8R7fBpXZ","country":"CA","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"","country_name":"Canada","replies":1,"images":0},{"no":122530810,"now":"04\/23\/17(Sun)22:44:37","name":"Anonymous","com":"may 7th does she win?","time":1493001877,"resto":122530708,"id":"8R7fBpXZ","country":"CA","country_name":"Canada"}]},{"posts":[{"no":122504694,"now":"04\/23\/17(Sun)19:07:18","name":"Anonymous","sub":"Free will","com":"Where did this rumor that we have free will come from?<br><br>Things like sex drive, need to sleep, need for food and water preclude the possibility that we are each ultimately in control of our lives.<br><br>Or am I wrong?","filename":"1491048924395","ext":".jpg","w":1032,"h":827,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":200,"tim":1492988838265,"time":1492988838,"md5":"6zwL5ZDI\/\/76HKrMyp8mBg==","fsize":69096,"resto":0,"id":"wRD5UoqA","country":"US","m_img":1,"bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"free-will","country_name":"United States","replies":240,"images":25,"omitted_posts":235,"omitted_images":24,"tail_size":50},{"no":122529614,"now":"04\/23\/17(Sun)22:34:07","name":"Anonymous","com":"What would it take to prove free will??

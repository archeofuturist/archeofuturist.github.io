Genetic factors, hormonal factors, immunological factors, and more have been posited as possible biological causes. However, many experts argue that it\u2019s most likely a confluence of factors, as Barbara L. Frankowski and Committee on Adolescence did in a 2004 article in Pediatrics: \u201cSexual orientation probably is not determined by any one factor but by a combination of genetic, hormonal, and environmental influences.\u201d<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Regardless of how wide-ranging these studies are, they tend to have one thing in common: they treat gay men as a monolithic group. But now a research team out of the University of Toronto Mississauga (Ashlyn Swift-Gallant, Lindsay A. Coome, D. Ashley Monks, and Doug P. VanderLaan) has investigated variation within the population of gay men based on their anal-sex roles (that is bottom, or receptive, top, or penetrative, and versatile, or both receptive and penetrative depending on circumstance). The results of two of their studies suggest there very well could be biological subgroups of gay men, which is to say that one\u2019s biological makeup could possibly (and most likely, indirectly) influence whether or not he likes to fuck or get fucked (or both).<\/span><br>http:\/\/jezebel.com\/born-to-bottom-r<wbr>esearchers-report-biological-correl<wbr>ati-1794233584","filename":"1493662662001","ext":".jpg","w":1200,"h":740,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":154,"tim":1493718353583,"time":1493718353,"md5":"6aZy31WgHB3W6g0MJaURdw==","fsize":80007,"resto":0,"id":"OnT4Vn45","country":"IL","m_img":1,"bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"born-to-bottom-researchers-report-biological","country_name":"Israel","replies":15,"images":3,"omitted_posts":10,"omitted_images":2},{"no":123755144,"now":"05\/02\/17(Tue)06:49:05","name":"Anonymous","com":"Mazel tov","time":1493722145,"resto":123750846,"id":"GhgGpONj","country":"DE","country_name":"Germany"},{"no":123755145,"now":"05\/02\/17(Tue)06:49:06","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123754759\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123754759<\/a><br><a href=\"#p123754423\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123754423<\/a><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;not having a Submissive gf and being submissive yourself<\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;not getting a dominant Bull to Dom you both<\/span><br><br>I have been kept in chastity for weeks and also clean up the cum out of my gf after our bull cums inside her.<br><br>Me and my gf are wearing a Choker when our bull is around and he does with us as he pleases.<br><br>One of the most memorable experiences is when our bull bred me in front of my gf and filled my boywomb with his virile cum.

The classic stereotypical view of orphans is that they are emotionally scarred, depressed and misunderstood. This girl however is off the fucking handle.<br><br>She hates her adopted parents and still loves her biological parents even though they abandoned her. She argues that by abandoning her, she was given a worse sentence by living and having to deal with this void of not knowing them and forever living with the shame of being an orphan and being perceived differently. She argues death is a more suitable option.<br><br>Let me paint a scenario. Someone says &quot;wow! Aren&#039;t you so lucky yo have generous foster parents and live in a first world country? (she&#039;s Chinese by the way). Then she will proceed to get mad at that perception that since she is an orphan she is expected to feel grateful and thankful for what is perceived a good life.<br><br>The part that strikes me the most is she does not feel depressed, more angry. Angry that her real parents left even though she&#039;s never seen them. Angry that she&#039;s automatically supposed to feel grateful for living and the perceptions with it. Angry that she is a woman as in Chinese culture, a woman is still seen as a disadvantage. In her mind, having to deal with these constant factors is worse than death. Everyday she is on a non stop rage.<br><br>&quot;Why don&#039;t you kill yourself then?&quot; I say if all this enraging you. She gives me a very somber answer that simply being human gives her the drive to survive. Well \/pol\/? Are some things worse than death? If you&#039;re a Christian, you goddamn well know dying godless is the end of the world to you. You fear death without god. But for others, to them it&#039;s a break.","filename":"1484821130210 (2017_01_22 01_23_32 UTC)","ext":".jpg","w":400,"h":267,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":166,"tim":1493306934149,"time":1493306934,"md5":"QyGlFT31ODCbKO2j2hzgMg==","fsize":74090,"resto":0,"id":"CVkdlWkp","country":"NZ","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"is-there-a-worse-experience-than-death","country_name":"New Zealand","replies":0,"images":0}]},{"posts":[{"no":123033535,"now":"04\/27\/17(Thu)08:59:13","name":"Anonymous","com":"Is he our guy?<br><br>https:\/\/youtu.be\/M5IqH7oJ9h4","filename":"ben_shapiro_jews_leftist","ext":".png","w":400,"h":400,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":250,"tim":1493297953463,"time":1493297953,"md5":"v4hGiY+lc3sCKS129QzQpQ==","fsize":146327,"resto":0,"id":"6dj1SUv5","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"is-he-our-guy","country_name":"United States","replies":132,"images":34,"omitted_posts":127,"omitted_images":33,"tail_size":50},{"no":123046216,"now":"04\/27\/17(Thu)11:16:17","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123041411\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123041411<\/a><br><br>not pro-intervention..just calling spade a spade","time":1493306177,"resto":123033535,"id":"cxmszi9F","country":"CY","country_name":"Cyprus"},{"no":123046573,"now":"04\/27\/17(Thu)11:19:55","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123034038\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123034038<\/a><br>Israelis are really just a grand mix of Slavic and Jewish genes, which means natural born Kebab Terminators, which means they will support any political side that actively supports Kebab removal no matter what cause.","time":1493306395,"resto":123033535,"id":"g4r3fpil","country":"KR","country_name":"South Korea"},{"no":123046924,"now":"04\/27\/17(Thu)11:23:26","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123033535\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123033535<\/a><br>Someone post Ben and his commentary on Jew cartoons.","time":1493306606,"resto":123033535,"id":"TsenNJ7U","country":"LT","country_name":"Lithuania"},{"no":123047182,"now":"04\/27\/17(Thu)11:25:59","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123033535\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123033535<\/a><br>jewish people are nether liberals or neocons","time":1493306759,"resto":123033535,"id":"GvMZ6Wkk","country":"AR","country_name":"Argentina"},{"no":123047469,"now":"04\/27\/17(Thu)11:28:43","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123045421\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123045421<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Hence, we have a Christian society, a society defined by Christian values.<\/span><br>Where do you think you got your values?

I believe most left wing Jews who are involved with (((progressive))) causes probably do not understand the gravity of what they are pushing. It&#039;s in Jewish culture to see themselves as intrinsically<br>different to every homogeneous ethnic group they live beside. That&#039;s why Jews are a nation within a nation no matter where they live. They never fully assimilate, as long as they self identify as Jewish. <br>This logically, gives them both feelings of inferiority and superiority depending on the Jew in question. The inferior ones gravitate to the left and social justice whilst the superiour (psychopaths) gravitate to the banking industry and other amoral or immoral sectors of society, where power and money are easily obtainable as long as you have no ethics.<br>The problem is either left or right, most Jews have unlimited determination. They will keep pursuing a goal as much as the autistics of \/pol\/ who I&#039;d wager are disproportionately Jewish, due to the shilling and the autism.<br>And this message is really for the Jews here. Ones who feel they need to protect their culture due to rampant (((anti semitism))). <br>Nobody hates you based on your ethnicity. As far as 99.9999 % of people are concerned your white assholes. Not Jewish assholes. <br>Of corse you know this, because you have to identify yourselves to other Jews more often than not..it&#039;s not like when two black people meet is it. So your special snowflake ethicicty of &quot;Semites&quot; as we all know, is utter bullshit and just an excuse to smear anyone who calls you out on your bullshit as (((literally Hitler)))). <br>Weather you see it or not, the neocon Jews and the leftist Jews work in conjunction with each other..mostly this is done unconsciously as left wing Jews really do hate the right wing ones.<br>But the left need to realise, when neocons kikes destabilise the Middle East on greater Israels behalf..cause the refugee crisis. The left wing encourages with open arms.

Our ancestors left Europe for a reason. It was too cucked. They left Europe because they no longer wanted to be part of that culture. Being a white American does not make you a European. White Americans formed their own culture once they got here. Besides, &quot;European&quot; isn&#039;t even a race, it&#039;s a culture. One of the biggest flaws in the current WN scene is the lack of a clear definition of what &quot;white&quot; is. Most will just say that being European is white. If that&#039;s the case, Turks are white. Race is genetic, not cultural. Race IS genetic. Most leaders like Richard Spencer won&#039;t outright say that since it would put most people, and even some of his support, off of his bandwagon. If he says that race is genetic, which it is, his movement won&#039;t be as popular. But if he doesn&#039;t say it, the WN movement becomes this confusing broad movement that still doesn&#039;t specify what being white is.","time":1492620223,"resto":121852534,"id":"\/tKrcv1v","country":"US","country_name":"United States"}]},{"posts":[{"no":121863803,"now":"04\/19\/17(Wed)12:43:37","name":"Anonymous","com":"<span class=\"quote\">&gt;You can&#039;t unvote<\/span>","filename":"trumponsyria","ext":".jpg","w":800,"h":600,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":187,"tim":1492620217524,"time":1492620217,"md5":"slyyAUXurRuVKWISmr2C1A==","fsize":86470,"resto":0,"id":"W1VbYRRI","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"you-cant-unvote","country_name":"United States","replies":0,"images":0}]},{"posts":[{"no":121856039,"now":"04\/19\/17(Wed)11:31:45","name":"Anonymous","com":"<span class=\"quote\">&gt;nigger Muslim slaughters 8 Christian whites for being white<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;story gets completely swept under the rug in under 12 hours<\/span><br>This just reminds me why I&#039;m a white nationalist.","filename":"ap-fresno-shooter-kori-ali-muhammad-jc-170418_4x3_992","ext":".jpg","w":992,"h":743,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":187,"tim":1492615905891,"time":1492615905,"md5":"6j3E\/xxpNtSjC8IF5Nr5sA==","fsize":64877,"resto":0,"id":"gMQ8n3jp","country":"CA","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"nigger-muslim-slaughters-8-christian-whites-for","country_name":"Canada","replies":71,"images":14,"omitted_posts":66,"omitted_images":14},{"no":121863365,"now":"04\/19\/17(Wed)12:39:54","name":"Anonymous","filename":"fresno_2017-04-19_18-38-51","ext":".png","w":1901,"h":937,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":61,"tim":1492619994352,"time":1492619994,"md5":"BEq5wKgENggJSLdWIz5pxA==","fsize":536702,"resto":121856039,"id":"T0v6rIA6","country":"NO","m_img":1,"country_name":"Norway"},{"no":121863556,"now":"04\/19\/17(Wed)12:41:27","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121862460\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121862460<\/a><br><br>And we really to be force to separated.

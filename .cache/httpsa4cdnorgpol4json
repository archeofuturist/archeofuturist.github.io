I&#039;m not from here, I left my country years ago. Back in the 70s there were large groups of people who traveled around the country. Probably a hippie throwback from the 60s. You could disappear as an adult in these groups. And anything went. Drugs, sex, anything and everything. They were concentrated in more liberal areas where police and other authorities let us be. Or got favors from us. Literally tens of thousands of people lived like this. And us kids where treated as a commodity and used as currency. For instance a guy with mechanic skills could go into a commune for a few weeks. Fix everyones vehicles, and get paid in everything from peyote, food and nightly blowjobs from various kids. Then move on and disappear to another group. I&#039;m certain the world knew this was going on and accepted it as part of that world. The 70s was a pedo paradise. I remember when I was about 8 or 9 a woman joined our group for the night she was a smoking hot Comanche or some shit. She paid a lot of interest in me and was real sweet, and I has excited AF because I thought &#039;great, I&#039;m gonna get to screw her.&#039; That night all the adults are smoking up and my parents ended up kicking me out of the room so they could fuck her. I was so pissed, apart from a feel of her boobs I never saw any action. What part of all that isn&#039;t totally fucked up. That couldn&#039;t happen today, or at least not to the extent it took place back then.<br><br>So, in conclusion, there was a huge section of the 70s that was massively bluepilled.","time":1491730068,"resto":120257446,"id":"4sH1NrwR","country":"NZ","country_name":"New Zealand"}]},{"posts":[{"no":120255225,"now":"04\/09\/17(Sun)03:32:29","name":"Anonymous","com":"Really makes your neurons buzz","filename":"IMG_0266","ext":".jpg","w":600,"h":800,"tn_w":187,"tn_h":250,"tim":1491723149455,"time":1491723149,"md5":"ozMhoJwfC+RGO1+8UFl\/vw==","fsize":121744,"resto":0,"id":"LX5UdXcP","country":"PL","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"really-makes-your-neurons-buzz","country_name":"Poland","replies":47,"images":9,"omitted_posts":42,"omitted_images":9},{"no":120262817,"now":"04\/09\/17(Sun)05:17:13","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120255225\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120255225<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;cloth maker in africa cant make money cause nigger get free cloths from charities<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;cloth maker is broke<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;economy in africa is shit <\/span><br>JUST","time":1491729433,"resto":120255225,"id":"R6Od\/zrk","country":"IL","country_name":"Israel"},{"no":120262923,"now":"04\/09\/17(Sun)05:18:44","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120255225\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120255225<\/a><br><br>Saving endangered species is just another arrogant attempt by humans to control nature.","time":1491729524,"resto":120255225,"id":"OMZJyAwp","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":120262939,"now":"04\/09\/17(Sun)05:19:00","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120255225\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120255225<\/a><br>i think the answer why is obvious.<br>https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=4ob<wbr>N4N1Hw-g","time":1491729540,"resto":120255225,"id":"rjSN8pNz","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":120263496,"now":"04\/09\/17(Sun)05:26:16","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120255225\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120255225<\/a><br>quit using our money dammit.

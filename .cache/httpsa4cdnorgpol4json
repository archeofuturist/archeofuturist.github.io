The Brazilian government refused to allow French fishing vessels to catch spiny lobsters 100 miles off the Brazilian northeast coast, arguing that lobsters &quot;crawl along the continental shelf&quot;, while the French sustained that &quot;lobsters swim&quot; and that therefore, they might be caught by any fishing vessel from any country. The dispute was resolved unilaterally by Brazil, which extended its territorial waters to a 200-mile zone, taking in the disputed lobsters&#039; bed.","time":1492295285,"resto":121262274,"id":"sW0AVzXV","country":"BR","country_name":"Brazil"},{"no":121271763,"now":"04\/15\/17(Sat)18:28:45","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121270661\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121270661<\/a><br>Suriname? fuck those black welfare faggots. they all went to Netherlands to get welfare and fuck everybody.

I was listening to a debate of Richard Spencer with a black neocon and it struck me odd that they arent able to make a convincing argument because of focusing so much on white people.<br>Richard spencer basicly says that the reason diversity in the workplace, diversity councils etc are not progress is because they &quot;destroy the culture of the founding peoples of this country&quot; (meaning whites)<br>Im a white nationalist myself and this argument while being true, is not the full picture. A much more convincing way of saying the same thing is simply stating that a multicultural, diversity worshipping enviroment destroys the cultures of all those who end up in such a place. Blacks loose their culture. Whites loose their culture. Arabs loose their culture. It simply shows that while you are a white nationalist you have a degree of empathy and understanding that allows you to see that other ethnicities should also value their own culture.<br>Imho blacks, arabs, and the rest who are put in the multiculti vomit soup that is america right now all loose, and should all go back to their own countries and inspire nationalism in their own peoples.

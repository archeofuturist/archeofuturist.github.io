He assumed that because of their quick victories over Poland and France that his tactical genius would lead to a clean death to the soviets, and you can see that in his quote about the USSR, stating that it was a rotten house that only needed a good kick to knock it all down. Ironically, he was quite right in that regard but for the wrong reasons. He thought if they just overwhelmed them psychologically and did their blitzkrieg into the russian homeland that they would&#039;ve surrendered, but instead if they had focused entirely on moscow the russian&#039;s strategic command would&#039;ve completely fallen to bits as literally everything ran through moscow. All the trains merged in moscow, all the roads converged onto moscow, all the telegrams ran through moscow. It was literally the single hub of power in Russia. If the germans had focused on Moscow and then moved onto other targets, the russians would&#039;ve not only been disorientated, but without leadership leading to splintered army fragments acting without orders which would&#039;ve been easy pickings for the trained Wehrmacht.<br><br><br>tl;dr Hitler was an idiot and should&#039;ve trusted his generals.","time":1492892801,"resto":122319575,"id":"p4LblP0Y","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":122322714,"now":"04\/22\/17(Sat)16:26:50","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122322241\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122322241<\/a><br>he probably saw what was going on and thought he would be next.

Obviously, when it comes to things like theft or drug possession\/drug distribution or what have you, you shouldn&#039;t collaborate with the pigs. But what about a hypothetical situation where it might benefit innocent people more than it would benefit the cops? For example, there is a serial killer on the loose, and for whatever reason, you have evidence and\/or knowledge that can be very helpful to catching the killer.

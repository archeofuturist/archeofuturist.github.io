I&#039;ve been thinking about &quot;Het vrije woord aan de macht&quot; a lot, since it emphasizes the belief in a principle and not just in the people.

It could be effective at endearing baudet to some, assuming we can break the &quot;wat een bal&quot; stereotype (although those people probs can&#039;t be reached easily). The problem I see with it is that it does not have anything to do with politics or what Baudet stands for. We&#039;re trying to shoehorn that in after the fact. So we should be honest about this just being fan merchandise with a clever meme, but it is in fact more politically inert than the partijkartel business for example. My problem with the latter is that it is explicitly _against_ something, the kartel, which is great as a rallying cry but is not constructive otherwise.","time":1490889526,"resto":118920707,"id":"fYorSY+6","country":"NL","country_name":"Netherlands"}]},{"posts":[{"no":118934072,"now":"03\/30\/17(Thu)11:58:46","name":"Anonymous","sub":"Senate committee hearing on Russian interference","com":"Why is there no thread for this?<br><br>Video:<br>http:\/\/www.usatoday.com\/story\/news\/<wbr>nation\/2017\/03\/29\/watch-update-russ<wbr>ia-investigation-senate-intelligenc<wbr>e-committee-leaders\/99784248\/<br><br>C-SPAN Radio:<br>http:\/\/tunein.com\/radio\/C-SPAN-Radi<wbr>o-901-s28047\/","filename":"warnerburr","ext":".png","w":609,"h":343,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":140,"tim":1490889526378,"time":1490889526,"md5":"XXSAarBlLkf\/PqR1Hq6OqQ==","fsize":239052,"resto":0,"id":"CjrpgMc3","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"senate-committee-hearing-on-russian-interference","country_name":"United States","replies":0,"images":0}]},{"posts":[{"no":118932057,"now":"03\/30\/17(Thu)11:37:44","name":"Anonymous","sub":"honest thoughts on pjw?","filename":"1488711270033","ext":".jpg","w":1200,"h":675,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":140,"tim":1490888264496,"time":1490888264,"md5":"JQtsVt9LEek0FkL4p\/nuag==","fsize":98165,"resto":0,"id":"YvCApw7m","country":"GB","m_img":1,"bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"honest-thoughts-on-pjw","country_name":"United Kingdom","replies":23,"images":4,"omitted_posts":18,"omitted_images":1},{"no":118933677,"now":"03\/30\/17(Thu)11:54:14","name":"Anonymous","com":"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=g72<wbr>BBoL_O2Q&amp;ab_channel=StevenVenus<br><br>PJW and Alex Jones are gay lovers. 0:29","time":1490889254,"resto":118932057,"id":"Xs+0eUWU","country":"NL","country_name":"Netherlands"},{"no":118933714,"now":"03\/30\/17(Thu)11:54:35","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118932057\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118932057<\/a><br>He&#039;s okay but Alex Jones is his boss and I fucking hate Alex Jones.

The day was chosen because it represents how far into 2017 women must work in order to make the same amount that men made in 2016. Their website states that \u201cbecause women earn less, on average, than men, they must work longer for the same amount of pay.\u201d This statement implies some sort of systematic discrimination against female workers, when in fact there are many factors \u2014 conveniently omitted from almost all feminist narratives \u2014 that contribute to the so-called \u201cwage gap.\u201d<br><br>Primarily, women are more likely to take time off work for childcare, leading to less experience and fewer opportunities for career growth later in life. Some blame oppressive societal gender roles for urging women to be the caretakers of the home, but the reality is that women are less likely to devote the majority of their lives to their careers \u2014 leading to fewer overall wage earnings. Additionally, women are far more likely to take lower-stress, lower-risk jobs than men \u2014 such as secretaries, nursing aides, and primary education teachers\u2014which tend to be lower-paying. <br>Data from the Bureau of Labor Services show that men make up 93 percent of high-risk jobs \u2014 such as mining, flight engineering, and law enforcement. Consequently, they are far more likely than women to incur serious injuries or be killed on the job, and compensation for these risks helps to account for the existence of a wage gap. In fact, a BLS report on fatal occupational injuries found that of approximately 4,800 people killed as a result of a work-related injury in 2015, almost 4,500 of them were men \u2014 a stunning number that receives little attention when comparing the wages of men and women.","filename":"Screenshot from War Dogs 2016 1080p BluRay x264 DTS-JYK.mkv - 1","ext":".png","w":1920,"h":800,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":104,"tim":1491649941358,"time":1491649941,"md5":"p5j8E25tvo8UPRKZv\/3xJw==","fsize":1707858,"resto":0,"id":"vRwqbENv","country":"IL","m_img":1,"bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"gender-pay-gap-doesnt-exist","country_name":"Israel","replies":0,"images":0}]}]}

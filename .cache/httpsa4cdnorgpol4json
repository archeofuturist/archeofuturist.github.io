Daily reminder that sea levels around the world were about 400 feet lower just before the end of the last Ice Age.<br><br>Near the end of the last Ice Age about 12,800 years ago, a giant comet that had entered the Solar System from deep space thousands of years earlier, broke into multiple fragments. Some of these fragments struck Earth, causing a global cataclysm unseen since the extinction of the dinosaurs. At least eight of the fragments hit the North American ice cap, while further fragments hit the Northern European ice cap. The impacts, from comet fragments a mile wide approaching at more than 60,000 miles an hour, generated huge amounts of heat which instantly liquidised millions of square kilometres of ice, destabilising Earth&#039;s crust and causing the global flood that is remembered in myths all around the world.<br><br>A second series of impacts, equally devastasting, causing further cataclysmic flooding, occurred about 11,600 years ago, the exact date that Plato gives for the destruction and submergence of Atlantis. The evidence for all of this shows beyond reasonable doubt that a civilisation at least as technologically advanced as 19th-century England at the onset of the Industrial Revolution (if not more technologically advanced) that flourished during the last Ice Age was destroyed in the global cataclysms between about 12,800 years ago and about 11,600 years ago.<br><br>A distant memory and a warning to the future - for the comet that wrought such destruction in remote antiquity may not be done with us yet.","filename":"iceagemap","ext":".png","w":853,"h":440,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":128,"tim":1493127842998,"time":1493127842,"md5":"cs0+u5uti9vK6vqtSQSaoQ==","fsize":557051,"resto":0,"id":"MT5xsBCS","country":"AU","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"the-red-parts-of-this-map-used-to-be-land-daily","country_name":"Australia","replies":20,"images":4,"omitted_posts":15,"omitted_images":2},{"no":122736863,"now":"04\/25\/17(Tue)10:04:43","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122736696\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122736696<\/a><br><br>When you make absolutely absurd, baseless statements without a single shred of evidence to back up your claim there is no reason anyone should even attempt logic as a response, since you&#039;ve clearly thrown it out the window.<br><br>Take your retarded shit back to \/x\/.","time":1493129083,"resto":122734952,"id":"XJf5sQfT","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":122736879,"now":"04\/25\/17(Tue)10:04:58","name":"Anonymous","com":"first of, we are still in an ice age. its as long an ice age as one or both poles are frozen the whole year (depending on which definition you use). only when one pole stops being completely frozen you can say we are not in an ice age anymore, and then you will have people argue the other definition is right so you have to wait till this goes for both poles.<br><br>either way if you are interested in ancient civilizations before the sumerians <br>https:\/\/archive.4plebs.org\/pol\/thre<wbr>ad\/122271758","time":1493129098,"resto":122734952,"id":"7MpVC1Zx","country":"DE","country_name":"Germany"},{"no":122736970,"now":"04\/25\/17(Tue)10:05:56","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122736863\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122736863<\/a><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Take your retarded shit back to \/x\/.<\/span><br><br>No. :)","time":1493129156,"resto":122734952,"id":"MT5xsBCS","country":"AU","country_name":"Australia"},{"no":122737308,"now":"04\/25\/17(Tue)10:09:41","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122736806\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122736806<\/a><br>This makes a huge amount of sense.","time":1493129381,"resto":122734952,"id":"eT4AUwGc","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":122737700,"now":"04\/25\/17(Tue)10:13:42","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122734952\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122734952<\/a><br>We wuz kimi no na wa n sheit","time":1493129622,"resto":122734952,"id":"Jkii5JiU","country":"CA","country_name":"Canada"}]},{"posts":[{"no":122721922,"now":"04\/25\/17(Tue)06:56:53","name":"Anonymous","com":"Daily reminder that libertarians and national socialists have to start playing nice because we are in this fight against antifa together.","filename":"de59a22584a9aae34595f41d9d48bdb67fed5a926715eb3ec96d1f9b685ff8a5","ext":".png","w":500,"h":237,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":118,"tim":1493117813146,"time":1493117813,"md5":"56+k1GqJXoRky0or\/OESKQ==","fsize":68359,"resto":0,"id":"+v8GrKDY","country":"EE","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"daily-reminder-that-libertarians-and-national","country_name":"Estonia","replies":66,"images":22,"omitted_posts":61,"omitted_images":20},{"no":122736778,"now":"04\/25\/17(Tue)10:03:44","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122731313\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122731313<\/a><br>Got a version that can actually be read?","time":1493129024,"resto":122721922,"id":"bvuKwua1","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":122736820,"now":"04\/25\/17(Tue)10:04:15","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122731313\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122731313<\/a><br>unironically this, pic saved, gas turned on","time":1493129055,"resto":122721922,"id":"69D66jBE","country":"DE","country_name":"Germany"},{"no":122736900,"now":"04\/25\/17(Tue)10:05:07","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122735788\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122735788<\/a><br>Oh fugg :DDDDDD","time":1493129107,"resto":122721922,"id":"bvuKwua1","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":122736905,"now":"04\/25\/17(Tue)10:05:11","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122726371\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122726371<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;we could easily afford a welfare state<\/span><br>It should also be known that, in national socialism, the taxes that are collected, are mainly used by the government to invest in infrastructure, transportation, public health, national security,..., which creates jobs to help the working class, instead of just &quot;redistributing wealth&quot;

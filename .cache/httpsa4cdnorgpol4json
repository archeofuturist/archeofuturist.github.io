I was in a relationship with a girl who was a hardcore smoker. it was good, made her nicer, but it was hard to not use when its always around you. like, by age 21 I was having more and more anxiety every time I smoked. so I tried to stop, but I&#039;m the kind of person who takes advantage of whats in front of me. after we broke up, I stopped for a year. turned 24 got another job and smoked a good amount. my feelings and such while high where still the same. still feeling incredible anxiety. now am 25 and only smoke when I have money. which is never cause i dont work. i honestly think it just comes from depression. I&#039;ve wanted out of life since I was 14, but I cant into suicide. so I think weed just gives me the pressure to do it, but not really the means to. so it bugs me that I can&#039;t end it. dont know, ill still keep smoking though,. the immersion I get in video games is too good to just stop using because. like I said, love hate relationship.

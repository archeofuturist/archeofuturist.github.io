A being that demands you mutilate your genitals, offer blood sacrifices and burnt sigils, kill your son as a test, destroys entire cities for being icky sodomites, attempted to kill Moses for not mutilating his son until his wife did it with a rock, intentionally brings horrific plagues on a country so everyone will know how much of a sadistic asshole God is in the future, kills every firstborn son including children while passing over houses marked with blood sigils, commands that people be killed over stupid arbitrary shit, among countless more violent acts and stupid arbitrary commands sounds more like a malevolent, demonic entity than a loving father to me. There is no wisdom to be found in religions that humans haven&#039;t already known for thousands of years prior to it being introduced. Even primitive humans, in the northern hemisphere at least, realized working and banding together was much more beneficial than killing each other if to a lesser extent than today. Don&#039;t kill\/steal\/rape etc comes naturally to anyone that isn&#039;t mentally defect.","time":1493450249,"resto":123287117,"id":"2NtPhYRM","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":123308993,"now":"04\/29\/17(Sat)03:18:14","name":"Anonymous","filename":"17522815_411143839263881_7587445753855707742_n","ext":".jpg","w":856,"h":912,"tn_w":117,"tn_h":125,"tim":1493450294272,"time":1493450294,"md5":"E8tFWjIOlpaaLAxAu9vdtQ==","fsize":119079,"resto":123287117,"id":"mhteBnx5","country":"AU","country_name":"Australia"},{"no":123309065,"now":"04\/29\/17(Sat)03:19:39","name":"Anonymous","com":"Was proof of God&#039;s existence ever found?

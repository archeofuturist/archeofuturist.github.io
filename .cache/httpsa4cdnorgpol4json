And it&#039;s always a little awkward when they want to cosplay, because, well, they don&#039;t have much.

Thing is, in Overwatch the black characters they do have are just black, with no real other traits. Lucio, for instance, is just a guy. A guy who&#039;s black.<br><br>And while that&#039;s fine and all, it doesn&#039;t make for an interesting character.

The black cigar-chomping Sergeant Johnson. As a kid, I looked up to this character because he had a hellava personality, and was just damn cool.<br><br> I haven&#039;t seen a black character in any one of these &quot;diverse&quot; games fitting that role yet. <br><br>Right now we&#039;ve just got characters who are black because they&#039;re black. Fuck that, give them an awesome personality, maybe a few character flaws, and maybe then people will want to dress up as them. The goal isn&#039;t to make a character who only black people will want to cosplay, but one who whites will too. If you have a character who&#039;s so fucking awesome he\/she appeals to both races, then you&#039;ve got a proper character.<br><br><a href=\"#p123231381\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123231381<\/a><br>This guy is the perfect example of everything that&#039;s wrong with black characters today.

This could not happen without the resurrection. Doesn&#039;t this mean Judas kind of got screwed hard and unrightfully sent to hell? <br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Walked with Christ yet still didn&#039;t see him as the Son of God. <\/span><br>Wouldn&#039;t just being near Christ make a nonbeliever turn? Wouldn&#039;t he just be that immaculate? <br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Christ knew of his Crucifixion through both the scripture and the fact his is Omniscient. And knew of the betrayal beforehand.<\/span><br>Why would he not save a person he needed to betray him it? Why wouldn&#039;t he try harder to save Judas, I mean they spent so much time together but just let him fall? He even went as far as to say the world would have been better without him.<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Scripture said Satan jumped into him. <\/span><br>Why wouldn&#039;t Christ stop this? Why would he then blame Judas for getting taken over when he needed him to anyway. <br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Judas did good things in life and saw Jesus do some crazy shit. <\/span><br>Judas saved a ton of people and healed people, he wasn&#039;t a bad guy I don&#039;t think.

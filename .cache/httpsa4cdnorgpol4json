As long as they&#039;re a minority, I&#039;m prepared to welcome Asians (the good ones, Koreans, Japanese, etc.) into the White ethnostate. Their personality traits mostly check out - there&#039;s a bit of a lack of creativity and entrepreneurship, but they make up for it in pure productivity. They&#039;re hardworking, technically intelligent, and have light skin. Even more importantly, they have very white noses - at worst Grecian, at best English and snubby. The slanty eyes aren&#039;t ideal, but honestly they breed out in one or two generations. To boot, many of them are already Christians.<br><br>I think East Asians would make a solid ally for Whites and could play a great role in the coming war, and I definitely want them on our side.

It was the dominant empire of the West, even the snow niggers were irrelevant despite beating them back. <br><br>Meanwhile, the Mongolian Empire, Chinese, Islamic, Persian, etc etc all changed capitals and governments multiple times, hardly ever being consistent with territory. Rome only changed once, to Constantinople, but Rome was so significant its culture and social norms around Europe quickly fell. <br><br>Rome is still second to the greatest Empire of all time, and that&#039;s the United States, which has had the greatest impact on the entire world than any Empire before it. The United States has uplifted billions out of poverty, advanced the rest of the world a thousand years, and changed culture forever, and will be most likely to be the first to colonize the stars. Yes, we stand on the shoulders of Rome, but this is the next step in humanity&#039;s rising.","time":1492320492,"resto":121301032,"id":"Cb2JZgN6","country":"US","country_name":"United States"}]},{"posts":[{"no":121310777,"now":"04\/15\/17(Sat)23:36:20","name":"Anonymous","com":"I know alot of yall are gonna be fucking pissed in this thread.

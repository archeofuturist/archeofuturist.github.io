He hated everyone for either hurting him or not helping him. This actually didn\u2019t have a lot to do with racism but with developing a strong feeling of hatred and blaming others for his miserable existence. The expressions of racism came together with his preaching of Natural Selection and his longing for Godliness - being officially higher than everyone else. This can generally be seen as defense mechanisms, as Eric created an image of him being superior because he felt incredibly inferior. He wanted to demonstrate power because he felt powerless, as mentioned in the documentary Columbine: Understanding Why. The hatred can be connected to this as well: he wasn\u2019t full of hate but maybe full of fear, sadness and loneliness, which he turned into hatred because it was easier for him to cope with. He also needed the hatred and the anger to go through with the massacre, so that was what he felt - or what he was trying to feel and what he expressed to others.","time":1491511300,"resto":119788933,"id":"6GYmllp1","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":119791627,"now":"04\/06\/17(Thu)16:42:34","name":"Farewelll Sydo","com":"<a href=\"#p119791521\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119791521<\/a><br>What can be generally stated from this is that Eric\u2019s racism could be more of a dislike towards the whole human race, which came along with his increasing mental health issues and the toll of the bullying and other problems he faced in his lifetime.

They have the nerve to think that they can tell us what is right and wrong. <br>7) Rip up the charter of rights and freedoms which enabled the courts to take absolute control. The courts should not have the power to ignore the will of the people when that will is clearly well thought out and not a momentary panic. <br>8) DIscard environmental regulations which are responsible for rising prices. For example, a highway 6 bypass in ontario has been delayed for decades because of an osprey nest. Instead every day gas and time was wasted in traffic jams on a two lane road which should have been four or six lanes. Environmental reviews take decades of &quot;professionals&quot; jerking off in the woods collecting hundreds of thousands of dollars before finally saying its okay to kill a few frogs. Its a fraud and money grab, a way for the liberal government to buy votes.<br>9) Privatize everything as long as the service\/product can be competed over. The privitisation of Hydro One was idiotic since the rules set in place hinder competition. Additionally, it is unrealistic to have multiple companies feeding the same neighbourhood with seperate electrical infrastructure. Perhaps the hydro grid could be split into sections and each section is auctioned off each year. The contractor would be responsible for maintaining the hydro infrastructure in that area and for sections of the power source.

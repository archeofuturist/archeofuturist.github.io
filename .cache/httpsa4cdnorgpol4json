Been here since i was a 12 year old faggot on \/b\/, 2 or 3 years later went to \/pol\/, when i went to college i was here almost every day, 24 now.<br>There&#039;s so many problems in this world, some seem almost unfixable, such as islam, the black community, the spread of socialistic thinking, the destruction of higher education, university was supposed to help us connect more dots in our minds so we can grow into a generation of problem solvers, instead college fags are growing to be problem makers. Many things we used to enjoy now seem like they have to be abandoned for us to become wiser and untainted. I&#039;ve discarded every single one of my friends because i don&#039;t want to catch their stupid. Is there a simple solution to all of this? How do we approach such trivial times where truth is harder to find than dinosaur remains? Is it really as simple as eliminating the jews? Do we only listen to ourselves and our own feelings? Do we only follow white cultutre and white thinking? The white race really has created the most beautiful of civilization when compared to others, do we simply abandon blacks and the cultures they&#039;ve created? I like to think that we all prosper when we help eachother, i think the issue is what we define as &quot;helping&quot; While democrats want to help blacks by giving them welfare, us republicans view that as harming them because they give them fish instead of teach them how to catch them. <br>Sometimes i feel like everything is a lost cause, but then i think of how we&#039;ve evolved over the however many millions of years, from a single bang that created the universe, to the first form of bacteria, to a fully functional human being, to a world of cars, buildings, religion, space travel, government. Will there ever come a time where everything will be okay, we just exist in peace and worry about nothing because we understand it all.","filename":"stilldontgetit","ext":".jpg","w":600,"h":400,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":166,"tim":1491360232408,"time":1491360232,"md5":"ehEkvo+oMvloxdK73oRFkw==","fsize":197924,"resto":0,"id":"L0GDa0+y","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"been-lurking-on-here-for-many-years-i-usually","country_name":"United States","replies":0,"images":0}]},{"posts":[{"no":119551670,"now":"04\/04\/17(Tue)22:09:30","name":"Anonymous","sub":"What if Islam is the only answer?","com":"<span class=\"quote\">&gt;tfw you finally take the snackbar pill<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;tfw you realize that Islam is the only way to rid the world of women&#039;s rights and save western civilization<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;tfw its the easiest way to get liberals to vote against their interests<\/span>","filename":"tmp_31216-14903408043941239008862","ext":".jpg","w":709,"h":408,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":143,"tim":1491358170194,"time":1491358170,"md5":"V\/Nsu8zzTP8QsiafO1lSXA==","fsize":54739,"resto":0,"id":"q8fwUe4s","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"what-if-islam-is-the-only-answer","country_name":"United States","replies":39,"images":10,"omitted_posts":34,"omitted_images":8},{"no":119555083,"now":"04\/04\/17(Tue)22:39:27","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119554697\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119554697<\/a><br>I don&#039;t know what else to do.

discrimination,&quot; Judge Diane Wood wrote for the 7th Circuit Court of Appeals.<br>The ruling is a victory for Kimberly Hively, who sued Ivy Tech Community College, arguing that the school violated Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 when it denied her employment.<br><br>&quot;Any discomfort, disapproval, or job decision based on the fact that the complainant -- woman or man -- dresses differently, speaks differently, or dates or marries a same-sex partner, is a reaction purely and simply based on sex,&quot; Wood wrote.<br><br>&quot;That means that it falls within Title VII&#039;s prohibition against sex discrimination, if it affects employment in one of the specified ways,&quot; Wood added.<br><br>&quot;This decision is (a) game-changer for lesbian and gay employees facing discrimination in the workplace and sends a clear message to employers: it is against the law to discriminate on the basis of sexual orientation,&quot; said Greg Nevin of Lambda Legal, the group that

case.","filename":"rainbowcake","ext":".jpg","w":300,"h":216,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":180,"tim":1491358048858,"time":1491358048,"md5":"C2B8hMY0tzk56rN7x2CIqw==","fsize":16277,"resto":0,"id":"SsKaDZV6","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"federal-court-lgbt-employees-protected-from","country_name":"United

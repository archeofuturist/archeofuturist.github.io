How is that going to treat each individual symptoms that Marijuana advocates claim that MJ heals? Hint: It doesnt.<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Yeah OK but it&#039;s NOT ADDICTING!!!<\/span><br><br>False. The 2012 National survey on Drug Use and Health estimates that 2.7 million people 12 years of age and older meet the DSM-IV criteria for dependence on Marijuana. More so, an adolescent brain is much more suspectable to addiction than an adult. This has received support from studies where animals have shown that parental exposure to THC can recalibrate the sensitivity of the reward system to other drugs. That same exposure affects interferes with cytoskeletal dynamics which are critical for the establishment of axonal connections between neurons.","filename":"SayNoToWeed","ext":".jpg","w":484,"h":502,"tn_w":241,"tn_h":250,"tim":1493694317866,"time":1493694317,"md5":"AIhG4rnqwAz5w9CRL2puww==","fsize":60291,"resto":0,"id":"ypSMYy9H","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"you-are-a-degenerate-if-you-smoke-marijuana","country_name":"United States","replies":153,"images":29,"omitted_posts":148,"omitted_images":28,"tail_size":50},{"no":123727442,"now":"05\/02\/17(Tue)00:39:15","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123727384\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123727384<\/a><br>No such thing as nigger plants, nigger.","time":1493699955,"resto":123717036,"id":"VcElGh0R","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":123727641,"now":"05\/02\/17(Tue)00:41:13","name":"Anonymous","com":"This <a href=\"#p123723854\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123723854<\/a><br>Take the redpill.","time":1493700073,"resto":123717036,"id":"zKT4U8kf","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":123727644,"now":"05\/02\/17(Tue)00:41:15","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123726407\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123726407<\/a><br><br><br>Funny, I googled racist and didnt see my name. <br><br>Google isn&#039;t very credible.","time":1493700075,"resto":123717036,"id":"wtQM5NvA","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":123727698,"now":"05\/02\/17(Tue)00:41:42","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123727429\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123727429<\/a><br><br>Quick breakdown<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;You (quoted below)<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;google degenerate ... broad word and definitely would be applied to purposely inhaling the smoke of anything<\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Me (below (replying))<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;You are calling people who put &quot;smoke in their lungs&quot; degenerates<\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;You<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt; you think that anyone who opposes things like this are fundamentalist christian stereotypes.<\/span><br><br>What does this even mean?

Traits like albinoism or gigantism show up in the genepool 99% of them are retards with low chances of survival much less breeding but the 1% actually grows a trait that makes them better suited to their environment so they have more kids on average than the regular member of the species. Repeat this over thousands of years with new traits popping up now and again while new physical stresses of the environment happening like volcanoes erupting or forests burning down causing migrations and population segmentation and you get many different potentially new genes getting worked into the population at the same time. Now stretch that over millions of years and eventually those gene patterns will become so divergent from each other that animals with the same common ancestor will be unable to breed, but since you have survival of the fittest constantly weeding out the 99% of useless gene malformations, the new populations that emerge are stable and suited to their environments.<br><br>Its sound. It has no social implications.

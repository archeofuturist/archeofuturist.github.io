Most radical Muslim&#039;s are only radicalised because they went to one of these Saudi salafi funded mosques and they got cucked by a foreign culture who only want to turn them into soldiers for the Wahabhi cause so that inbred Saudis can lead the Sunni world. They&#039;re literally replacing their culture with a foreign culture from Saudi Arabia. The niqab is a Saudi creation. When the ottomans ruled the middle east, premarital relations was common enough in even Saudi Arabia, that when Mohammed ibn wahab tried to get the local tribesmen to stop having premarital sex,they banished him from the area. The ottomans made him drink alcohol and listen to music as punishment, when his forces rebelled, and the ottomans defeated the rebellion and captured wahab.

Bernie Sanders is not where they should be fixing their gaze. Sanders is clear that he is not a Democrat \u2014 except when he needs to be one in order to run for president. Yet he is demanding that the Democratic Party head for what Rebecca Traister last week called \u201cthird-way centrist bullshit.\u201d<br><br>Economic populism and what are commonly erroneously and dismissively referred to as \u201csocial issues\u201d \u2014 such as reproductive rights, immigration reform and civil rights for people of color, those who have disabilities, people of all faiths, LGBT people and women \u2014 are indivisible. Sanders routinely demonstrates his own lack of progressive values by dividing them.<br><br>There is no economic populism without abortion rights and civil rights. No one can have economic justice if he or she doesn\u2019t have fundamental rights. Yet Sanders has made it plain that abortion rights are negotiable and brushes off \u201cidentity politics.\u201d He consistently argues that his values \u2014 and his alone \u2014 should define what it is to be progressive. (Which can\u2019t help but remind one of Donald Trump\u2019s unilateral defining of terms.)<br><br>Further, Sanders routinely divides matters of race and gender and class \u2014 which, again, cannot be untwined \u2014 by discussing the \u201cpain\u201d and needs of working-class voters and perpetuating the dangerous myth that the Democrats have ignored them. Sanders has insisted that Democrats have failed to reach these voters, while dismissing the fact that 75 percent of working-class voters of color voted for Clinton, not Trump, last year.","filename":"a-fucking-white-male","ext":".jpg","w":620,"h":412,"tn_w":249,"tn_h":166,"tim":1493091389407,"time":1493091389,"md5":"e6fZftyzSrhaQ0w302geoA==","fsize":229028,"resto":0,"id":"Oq4T0hJQ","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"the-left-is-eating-itself-alive-yet-again","country_name":"United States","replies":10,"images":1,"omitted_posts":5,"omitted_images":1},{"no":122687101,"now":"04\/24\/17(Mon)23:39:25","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122687078\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122687078<\/a><br>As Eric Sasson said in The New Republic, blaming Trump\u2019s win on a failure of the Democrats to engage working-class voters \u201clets off the hook an entire class of voters who are at least as responsible for Trump\u2019s victory: middle-class and wealthy suburban whites, who also came out in droves for Trump and who make up a larger part of his coalition.\u201d<br><br>We persist though we are blamed for her loss, while a historic voter gender gap showed that a majority of women, not men, as supporting Clinton over Trump.

We persist though we are told that Sanders and his followers are deciding how much of a litmus test to hold Democrats to before deciding on what level they are going to participate in the 2018 midterm elections.<br><br>It\u2019s ridiculous.

And the reason political elites are choosing careers for people, is because of the division of labor at work. They understand the economy better than everyone else because they&#039;re specialized in it. If you let everyone choose whatever they wanted to do with their lives, it may not be in the best interests of the economy as a whole, while a person in charge with actual technical knowledge of the economy could assign jobs not based on that persons wants and desires, but for the health of the economy as a whole. <br><br><a href=\"#p122683963\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122683963<\/a><br>You&#039;ve just stated an observation, not your reasoning behind making that observation.

There was stuff in the Bible that was later confirmed by archeology(places, people, chariots on the sea floor of the Red Sea (Moses parting the red sea), snakes used to have legs, etc.)<br>3. There are even non-believers&#039; accounts of some stuff Jesus did, just from them you can know a lot about Jesus if you piece it all together.<br>4. The differences between gospels aren&#039;t a bad sign, because witnesses rarely agree on stuff. If every eyewitness would say the same thing, it would be very fishy and would mean they probably talked to each other at one point.<br>5. The apostles died without getting rich, getting a girlfriend or getting power, they all died horribly. There was no point in spreading Christianity if they didn&#039;t believe in it. Why would they risk their life if it wasn&#039;t true? Why would they risk their life if it was all forged? Why would Paul try to join this new small church?<br>Also the only accounts of Romans getting Christians to change their faith was after the 1st century.

This general is for the discussion of communism, the next stage of human development.<br><br>Communism is the next stage of humanity following the capitalist stage.<br><br>What exactly is communism according to Marxist-Leninists:<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Communism is a stage of society in which the productive infrastructure is socially owned, and goods are produced not in order to sell for profit, but in order to meet a social need.<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Communism in it&#039;s full form is a stateless, classless society that follows the maxim &quot;From each according to their ability, to each according to their need.&quot;<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;To achieve such a society Marxism-Leninism teaches us that we must replace the capitalist state, which is controlled by the capitalist class, by a socialist state, which is controlled by the working class. Then, a period of class struggle follows in which the capitalist class is liquidated by the working class. When the capitalist class has been completely vanquished, there will be only one class, the working class, and eventually the functions of the state will become indistinguishable from the functions of the society as a whole, and the state as such will &#039;wither away&#039; as Marx said.<\/span><br>https:\/\/www.marxists.org\/archive\/ma<wbr>rx\/works\/1848\/communist-manifesto\/<br><br>Anarchists argue for the abolishment of hierarchy and an immediate establishment of a classless society with personal property, but without private property.<br>https:\/\/theanarchistlibrary.org\/lib<wbr>rary\/petr-kropotkin-the-conquest-of<wbr>-bread<br><br>Socialism or barbarism!","filename":"9655efc96a17b714a16144d9f877e52681f63c17e013856ed303365f3f137dda","ext":".png","w":669,"h":1065,"tn_w":157,"tn_h":250,"tim":1490583243225,"time":1490583243,"md5":"7coRjZBKSf3ndoGbRF94xA==","fsize":833245,"resto":0,"id":"Pibj9e6a","country":"US","m_img":1,"bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"hello-comrades-this-general-is-for-the-discussion","country_name":"United States","replies":75,"images":48,"omitted_posts":70,"omitted_images":43},{"no":118472452,"now":"03\/27\/17(Mon)00:42:52","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118471443\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118471443<\/a><br>this is b8<br>the soviets won ww2 on both fronts","time":1490589772,"resto":118461292,"id":"cZv3RKmo","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":118472505,"now":"03\/27\/17(Mon)00:43:25","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118471262\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118471262<\/a><br><a href=\"#p118471522\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118471522<\/a><br><a href=\"#p118471937\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118471937<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;sometimes you have to realize where your political opponent is coming from and their personal mindset on the issue<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;hehe teh leaf BTFO lel<\/span>","filename":"logo-large","ext":".png","w":284,"h":115,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":50,"tim":1490589805465,"time":1490589805,"md5":"33sRxoWLOewkEeDOps5hoQ==","fsize":2749,"resto":118461292,"id":"Rb94N7we","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":118472751,"now":"03\/27\/17(Mon)00:45:52","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118472452\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118472452<\/a><br>Hitler&#039;s loss was the loss of every White man on the face of the earth","time":1490589952,"resto":118461292,"id":"kf7motK4","country":"DE","country_name":"Germany"},{"no":118473399,"now":"03\/27\/17(Mon)00:52:32","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118472505\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118472505<\/a><br>t. leaf in burger proxy<br>Day of the rake when?","time":1490590352,"resto":118461292,"id":"UGRTo9v\/","country":"MX","country_name":"Mexico"},{"no":118473929,"now":"03\/27\/17(Mon)00:57:52","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118473399\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118473399<\/a><br>dont worry i dont need a proxy to protect my feefees lol","filename":"9fe3ec371fad8d76b2c331412e13af49f2c8075ff6cece3809c8f69d8485e3b8","ext":".png","w":657,"h":527,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":100,"tim":1490590672240,"time":1490590672,"md5":"lYNo2gPTx\/hFpWQPXNoHCg==","fsize":44203,"resto":118461292,"id":"z5gDC\/IW","country":"CA","country_name":"Canada"}]},{"posts":[{"no":118472008,"now":"03\/27\/17(Mon)00:38:18","name":"Anonymous","sub":"Did the nazis escape to the south pole?","com":"When will Hitler rise up out of Antarctica \/pol\/ ?","filename":"&#039;v&#039;","ext":".jpg","w":632,"h":532,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":210,"tim":1490589498256,"time":1490589498,"md5":"86MU1IUGFELOJo+QKyxyXQ==","fsize":76622,"resto":0,"id":"rElUxnxI","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"did-the-nazis-escape-to-the-south-pole","country_name":"United States","replies":10,"images":2,"omitted_posts":5,"omitted_images":2},{"no":118472930,"now":"03\/27\/17(Mon)00:47:40","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118472731\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118472731<\/a><br>holy shit no way","filename":"Yeah","ext":".jpg","w":400,"h":400,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":125,"tim":1490590060941,"time":1490590060,"md5":"74I9g38nD41qIGJPJx+zWg==","fsize":19164,"resto":118472008,"id":"rElUxnxI","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":118473369,"now":"03\/27\/17(Mon)00:52:12","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118472654\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118472654<\/a><br>Alright, I lied.","time":1490590332,"resto":118472008,"id":"\/pimKqUT","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":118473662,"now":"03\/27\/17(Mon)00:55:14","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118472731\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118472731<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;mfw remnants of third reich wont contact me to work with them to save the white race and cleanse the jew<\/span><br><br>Ok suppose by some wild crazy chance they do actually exist.

The left and state are more eager to attack and crack down on right-wingers, because they fear more violent reactions from the islamists for example. Especially journalists are trying to pander to muslims, just to save their asses. According to Petry&#039;s media advisor, who worked for 20 years as a journalist himself, there is no ideology, or coherent thought behind that pandering, but mere cowardice. I don&#039;t know if that is true in all case, but it does play a major role, too. And that goes for the state aswell: fear a major violent reaction from Erdogan&#039;s Turks, so you crack down on smaller, less violent right-wing counter-demonstrations.

It&#039;d be much easier and enticing to recede back into one&#039;s echo chamber.<br><br>Another contributing factor is that these beliefs aren&#039;t coming exclusively from MSM and each other, but also very crucially from their humanities professors, who they&#039;ve been conditioned to regard as possibly the most trustworthy intellectual authorities in their lives.<br><br>So what do you guys think?

Who&#039;s going to kill the king if all his buddies profit from 99% other people&#039;s misery? You going to replace the king with some other asshole that worked under king? This is exactly why revolution happened. When did any king have any national pride? They conquered land, they injected those niggers, arabs..etc. all into your army. Nobody was bigger race-mixed than monarchies. Russia was racially pure Russian before Tsars, before Tsars injected Mongols and Muslims into Russia and called it Russian Tsar Empire, ever since they have mongolic features. Europe was racially pure in each country before Christian kings. They fucked up racial mixing big time during Austrian-Hungary, which is why Hitler and such were born. British Empire had slaves, they had slave trade with Ottoman Empire, all race mixers, nothing to do with nationalism. Monarchy only cares about ruling class power, not who they subjects are.","time":1493072808,"resto":122592120,"id":"HPGwT0iC","country":"SI","country_name":"Slovenia"},{"no":122648499,"now":"04\/24\/17(Mon)18:27:01","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122647575\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122647575<\/a><br>Been all over as far as where, I am currently in SLO but I lived in SJ for a while and Sacramento before that. <br><a href=\"#p122647544\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122647544<\/a><br>Elective monarchy is where its at hopefully the electors will be benevolent oligarchs who have no intention of selling out their nation so they will continously elect the best or their favorite of the bunch.

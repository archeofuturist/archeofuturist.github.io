We\u2019re being told that \u2018democracy\u2019 means \u2018what a slim majority of ill-informed voters felt on one afternoon in 2016\u2019. Preposterously, we\u2019re asked to believe that this is permanent and irreversible, regardless of the vast costs and non-existent benefits, and that the non-believers should somehow just accept that and stop questioning it. Get behind it, even. <br><br>It\u2019s not hard to understand why Paul Dacre and Nigel Farage want that. Like all fanatics, they have no rational arguments so they prefer to create an atmosphere where rational argument is forbidden - treasonous or unpatriotic.<br><br>Those of us who still have our cognitive capacities need to accept nothing. The Brexit vote was a con trick played on gullible people, who had been groomed for decades into believing that \u2018Brussels\u2019 was the cause of all their woes. There will never be a moment to \u2018get behind\u2019 something like that.<br><br>What we need to do is challenge it, every step of the way. Brexit is full of open goals, because it can\u2019t deliver anything it promised. It could break up the UK. It could destroy jobs and communities. It will bring no extra funds to the NHS. It will do nothing to reduce immigration numbers, except maybe replace the incoming French and Spanish with Muslims and Africans.<br><br>The question was on the EU, not the EEA (or other entities like EMA, ESA, Euratom, Erasmus which we are now being forced to leave without a mandate.)<br><br>Was that the \u2018will of the people\u2019? No. Far from it. Of course, some will try to save face by pretending they knew that all along, that everything\u2019s going according to plan, that up is down and black is white, but they\u2019ll have to do that against not only the demonstrable realities, but in the face of constant, relentless, unceasing, undermining, criticism.<br><br>That\u2019s the job \u2013 the patriotic, democratic duty - of the 48% and sane 52% , for the next two years and beyond.","filename":"divEU3","ext":".png","w":1315,"h":2239,"tn_w":73,"tn_h":125,"tim":1491017106091,"time":1491017106,"md5":"7p2WTqxCKehVPpA46DBWBg==","fsize":241464,"resto":119123117,"id":"jH0tz8pR","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":119138098,"now":"03\/31\/17(Fri)23:26:40","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119137947\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119137947<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;UKIP<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;3% remain<\/span>","filename":"Brexit voters","ext":".jpg","w":1162,"h":794,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":85,"tim":1491017200298,"time":1491017200,"md5":"5dVJSTboMP5mJw8T61l2qA==","fsize":78507,"resto":119123117,"id":"peN0XXRb","country":"US","m_img":1,"country_name":"United States"},{"no":119138158,"now":"03\/31\/17(Fri)23:27:20","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119136876\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119136876<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Anything he has to say regarding &#039;increased funding&#039; is out of the question as the money just doesn&#039;t exist, what do you think all the cuts are for?<\/span><br><br>What are you 12?<br>You do know that after WW2 we were bankrupt and still:<br>https:\/\/youtu.be\/k0eEa5ZOUtc<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Built Houses (Sold off by Neo_Liberals)<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Built Schools (Sold off and Privatised)<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Built Infrastructure (Sold off and Privatised)<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Increased wages (Reduced due to Monetarist policy requiring a pool of Unemployed labour (Later EU Labour) to keep wages very low)<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Increased Investment in future assets (which were sold off)<\/span><br>We currently had 2 bouts of QE these past 10 years; <br>That&#039;s the Government printing money.<br><br>The first batch went straight to prop up a failed Finance system following 2008 (started under Thatcher and her Monetarist policy of de-regulating big finance and destroying our manufacturing industries to be replaced a by a shit Service Sector economy.)<br><br>The second batch of QE went to Over-everaged buy-to-let landlords.<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Gov Prints QE round 2 in Coalition Gov.<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Given to Banks.<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Who lend to Buy-To-Let landlords.<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Who raise profits for Banks and raise House Prices.<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;BTL Landlords syphon off money to pay for housing benefit and get you to blame Jimmy Bucktooth when that Money could be used to create jobs and real Social houses.<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;BTL Landlords raise rents for the rest of us.<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Much our income goes on servicing other peoples debts via rising rents and insane house prices.<\/span><br><br><br>System of Cunts.<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;I live in fucking newcastle and went to a shit school, almost everyone I used to know 10 years ago is making 20k+ at age 21.<\/span><br><br>And I&#039;m from Manchester, grew up on an estate and got a Scholarship so i know exactly the type of people who are currently being trained to run the country<br>Trust me; They will happily fuck you and your Geordie mates over for a few rides on a Billionaire&#039;s Yacht.","filename":"Tony Benn genius","ext":".jpg","w":852,"h":1202,"tn_w":88,"tn_h":125,"tim":1491017240591,"time":1491017240,"md5":"fwS8u0\/9zXtnbgwApe2coQ==","fsize":270814,"resto":119123117,"id":"DcPn8dX4","country":"GB","m_img":1,"country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":119138248,"now":"03\/31\/17(Fri)23:28:30","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119137516\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119137516<\/a><br>Well he did name him Hilary, so I know why he betrayed his Father.<br><br>I think Hilary was just pissed he could never match his father.

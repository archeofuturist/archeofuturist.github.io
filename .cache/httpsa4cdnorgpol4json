And that decision should be made only when he is an adult.<\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;&quot;To be circumcised should be an informed, personal choice,&quot; Lise Moller, chair of the Doctors&#039; Association Ethics Board, said in a press release on Monday. &quot;It is most consistent with the individual\u2019s right to self-determination that parents not be allowed to make this decision, but that it is left up to the individual when he has come of age.&quot;<\/span><br>-Advertisement-<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Why didn&#039;t they call for the ban?<\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;&quot;We have discussed it thoroughly, also in our ethics committee,&quot; Moller said. &quot;We came to the conclusion that it is difficult to predict the consequences of a ban \u2013 both for the involved boys, who could for example face bullying or unauthorized procedures with complications \u2013 and for the cultural and religious groups they belong to.&quot;<\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Instead, the organization made the recommendation that circumcision should only be performed on under-age children when medically necessary.<\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;This opinion seems to align with the general public.

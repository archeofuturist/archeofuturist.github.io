The numbers:<br><br>Le Pen - 25%<br>Melenchon - 21.7%<br>Macron - 21.0%<br>Fillon - 20.2%<br>Hamon - 5.2%<br><br>Shut up an trust me on that. I will be right. Le Pen historically always overperforms her polls unless there is another credible right wing candidate for her votes to go to. There isn&#039;t. I have used a variety of other methods to calculate the other numbers; to be very brief, always remember that Macron&#039;s base is FRAGILE (1\/3 of voters could change minds) and is attracted to Melenchon&#039;s base, where as Fillon has stalled because of Penelopegate, and there is no reason to vote for Hamon as Melenchon becomes the candidate for the Left. <br><br>2nd Round will be 51.43% for Le Pen and 48.51% for Melenchon. Polls after the first round will show roughly a 54\/46 race, favouring Melenchon. <br><br>The crucial moment will come when Fillon ENDORSES Le Pen (or several prominent members of his party). Why would he\/they do that, you ask? Because they support Le Pen AGAINST the commie Melenchon (he wants 100% tax on rich). ALSO, they will have a parliamentary majority, and want to get shit done. THEY CAN GET SHIT DONE WITH LE PEN, BUT NOT WITH MELENCHON. This is crucial to remember.<br><br>This will be the FINAL BLOW. Currently (((polls))) predict the abstention rates of Fillon supporters in a 2nd round Le Pen\/Melenchon to be approximately 50%. (i.e. 50% do not vote at all). Fillon\/his party&#039;s endorsement of Le Pen will reduce this rate to approximately 30%, which results in the 51.43% victory I described above. So, add all these factors in and Le Pen will Make France Great Again. I&#039;m waiting, \/pol\/. Shortly, you will see that I was right.","filename":"Capture","ext":".png","w":401,"h":407,"tn_w":246,"tn_h":250,"tim":1492606689153,"time":1492606689,"md5":"bQ0kHM1zqVkIR2UL9YXz1Q==","fsize":216583,"resto":0,"id":"3SzxQ8AO","country":"AU","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"le-pen-will-win-guaranteed-2","country_name":"Australia","replies":100,"images":23,"omitted_posts":95,"omitted_images":21,"tail_size":50},{"no":121853922,"now":"04\/19\/17(Wed)11:11:38","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121853305\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121853305<\/a><br>exact","time":1492614698,"resto":121840937,"id":"WU8w5muY","country":"FR","country_name":"France"},{"no":121854036,"now":"04\/19\/17(Wed)11:12:33","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121853764\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121853764<\/a><br>How new can you be?

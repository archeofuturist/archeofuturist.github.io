In 2009, the UN and IFRC reported that over 800,000 Syrians had lost their entire livelihood as a result of the droughts. By 2011, the aforementioned GAR report estimated that the number of Syrians who were left extremely \u201cfood insecure\u201d by the droughts sat at about one million. The number of people driven into extreme poverty is even worse, with a UN report from last year estimating two to three million people affected.<\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;This has led to a massive exodus of farmers, herders and agriculturally-dependent rural families from the countryside to the cities. Last January, it was reported that crop failures (particularly the Halaby pepper) just in the farming villages around the city of Aleppo, had led \u201c200,000 rural villagers to leave for the cities.\u201d In October 2010, the New York Times highlighted a UN estimate that 50,000 families migrated from rural areas just that year, \u201con top of the hundreds of thousands of people who fled in earlier years.\u201d In context of Syrian cities coping with influxes of Iraqi refugees since the U.S. invasion in 2003, this has placed additional strains and tensions on an already stressed and disenfranchised population.<\/span><br><br><br>http:\/\/journals.ametsoc.org\/doi\/ful<wbr>l\/10.1175\/WCAS-D-13-00059.1","time":1493840451,"resto":123929907,"id":"vLBpg+a0","country":"FI","country_name":"Finland"},{"no":123952134,"now":"05\/03\/17(Wed)15:43:19","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123951254\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123951254<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Even though the model mean moved that movement is not outside the margin of error for the model so from a scientific perspective there was no warming trend.<\/span><br><br>And now I&#039;m going to challenge YOU to provide evidence for that statement.","time":1493840599,"resto":123929907,"id":"7dKYjF3v","country":"CZ","country_name":"Czech Republic"}]}]}

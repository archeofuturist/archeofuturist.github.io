Let&#039;s see if I can get some interest this week as well. I&#039;ll start with a brief blurb on &quot;sati&quot;, which is usually translated as &quot;mindfulness&quot;, but &quot;mindfulness&quot; is so contaminated with new agey associations you might as well forget the English word. The Buddhist term means something different from whatever you&#039;re thinking.<br><br>https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Sati_<wbr>(Buddhism)<br><br>There is absolutely nothing more important than direct awareness of what&#039;s going on in your mind. Nothing else compares. All your thoughts and actions are dictated by simple habitual mental shortcuts, and which shortcut you end up using and how well it works mostly depends on the current state of your mind and physical body. Turning your intelligence directly toward understanding those states on an intuitive level makes your mental shortcuts work much, much better. It&#039;s the difference between a five year old acting on instinct, and a self-aware adult seeing a situation, allowing his full creative faculties to understand what his senses are telling him, and acting accordingly. Is your mental awareness at the level of a five year old?

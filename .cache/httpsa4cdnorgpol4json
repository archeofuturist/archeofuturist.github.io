If white men were not allowed to vote, it is unlikely that the United Kingdom would be leaving the European Union, it is unlikely that Donald Trump would now be the President of the United States, and it is unlikely that the Democratic Alliance would now be governing four of South Africa&#039;s biggest cities.<\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;If white men no longer had the vote, the progressive cause would be strengthened. It would not be necessary to deny white men indefinitely \u2013 the denial of the vote to white men for 20 years (just less than a generation) would go some way to seeing a decline in the influence of reactionary and neo-liberal ideology in the world. The influence of reckless white males were one of the primary reasons that led to the Great Recession which began in 2008. This would also strike a blow against toxic white masculinity, one that is long needed.<\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;At the same time, a denial of the franchise to white men, could see a redistribution of global assets to their rightful owners. After all, white men have used the imposition of Western legal systems around the world to reinforce modern capitalism. A period of twenty years without white men in the world&#039;s parliaments and voting booths will allow legislation to be passed which could see the world&#039;s wealth far more equitably shared. The violence of white male wealth and income inequality will be a thing of the past.<\/span><br><br>-continued-","filename":"shelley_garland","ext":".jpg","w":230,"h":359,"tn_w":160,"tn_h":250,"tim":1492116368793,"time":1492116368,"md5":"5gRBiaelSJD9nUhlNnfghw==","fsize":18881,"resto":0,"id":"8oTQzuTJ","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"could-it-be-time-to-deny-white-men-the-franchise","country_name":"United States","replies":17,"images":3,"omitted_posts":12,"omitted_images":3},{"no":120964171,"now":"04\/13\/17(Thu)17:11:56","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120960863\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120960863<\/a><br>This creature should be thrown from the Tarpeian rock.","filename":"3e2","ext":".jpg","w":480,"h":712,"tn_w":84,"tn_h":125,"tim":1492117916878,"time":1492117916,"md5":"gX2DlqgPZr6V8ilIersKAw==","fsize":15704,"resto":120960863,"id":"6VYwOMSO","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":120964256,"now":"04\/13\/17(Thu)17:12:32","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120960863\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120960863<\/a><br>is this fucking satire?<br>i cant believe that this shit is allowed into the mainstream","time":1492117952,"resto":120960863,"id":"pVzUS5Eo","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":120964264,"now":"04\/13\/17(Thu)17:12:35","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120962084\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120962084<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;her<\/span>","time":1492117955,"resto":120960863,"id":"K6\/MdJgb","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":120964332,"now":"04\/13\/17(Thu)17:13:17","name":"Anonymous","com":"That fat guy is mentally ill.<br><br>I will disregard his article as the rantings of a madman.","time":1492117997,"resto":120960863,"id":"Xnc5PXzl","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":120964350,"now":"04\/13\/17(Thu)17:13:25","name":"Anonymous","com":"Why doesent someone legit tell these people they will pay them to live in Africa?<br><br>Like literally, if someone is shitting on the values of the free world, publicly ask them if they want to be given a free trip to live and make a new life in all these diverse places they venerate so much.<br><br>Its also always troglodyte-looking &quot;women&quot; that do this shit.","filename":"1454421584487","ext":".gif","w":240,"h":180,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":93,"tim":1492118005044,"time":1492118005,"md5":"0JxJAm8Mn7JAZexlmvCxWQ==","fsize":1953544,"resto":120960863,"id":"kMmG5eBr","country":"RS","country_name":"Serbia"}]},{"posts":[{"no":120951694,"now":"04\/13\/17(Thu)15:37:01","name":"Anonymous","sub":"Refugee children in Sweden are falling into coma-like states","com":"<span class=\"quote\">&gt; Resignation syndrome, or uppgivenhetssyndrom, has been diagnosed in 60 children this year<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt; It is believed to only exist among the refugee population of Sweden, where it has been prevalent since the early part of this century.<\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt; The children go into these comalike states when their families are notified that they will be deported.<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt; The only known cure is for their families to receive residency permits allowing them to stay in Sweden.<\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt; Rachel Aviv, a staff writer at The New Yorker, described these children in the article &quot;The Trauma of Facing Deportation.&quot;<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt; A similar phenomenon was observed in Nazi concentration camps, the New Yorker reported, in prisoners who had effectively lost all hope and given up. <\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt; There was a government report that posed a theory that the children, many of them Roma, came from holistic cultures, without a clear boundary between the individual self and the family.<\/span><br><br>http:\/\/archive.is\/1pEI5<br><br>Sweden needs its own Pinochet and a whole fleet of Helicopters.","filename":"Uppgivenhetssyndrom","ext":".jpg","w":900,"h":585,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":162,"tim":1492112221152,"time":1492112221,"md5":"8sGm+TV0l4Kc0JieA3JnyA==","fsize":81239,"resto":0,"id":"iF5i596m","country":"FR","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"refugee-children-in-sweden-are-falling-into","country_name":"France","replies":23,"images":15,"omitted_posts":18,"omitted_images":13},{"no":120962046,"now":"04\/13\/17(Thu)16:55:03","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120961378\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120961378<\/a><br>kek","time":1492116903,"resto":120951694,"id":"+QInnCVm","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":120962081,"now":"04\/13\/17(Thu)16:55:20","name":"Anonymous","com":"Why are the social democratic politicians so enamored over multiculturalism and foreigners to pull off ridiculous last-ditch effort propaganda like this?

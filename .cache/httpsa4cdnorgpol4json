I&#039;m very disillusioned at the moment. For all that right-wingers kick up a fuss about leftist bullshit, there&#039;s no actual way to stop their values from sinking in. The female vote was once an outrageous concept, and conservatives 100+ years ago resisted and complained about it. In spite of this, it is considered as normal now as a man&#039;s right to vote was in the early 1900s. The same thing is happening again with the acceptance of transfags. People aren&#039;t fully convinced yet, but the idea that gender can be decided by the individual will be as normal in the year 2120 as our conception of biologically determined gender is now. The point I&#039;m trying to make isn&#039;t about transgenderism in particular, though. I&#039;m just using it as an example to illustrate the inevitability of left-wing ideas rooting themselves into society.<br><br>The conservative mindset operates under the false assumption that the two sides have an equal chance of winning \u2013 that, by resisting lefty bollocks, you can keep tradition intact. But, in reality, it amounts to nothing more than a delaying tactic. Once a libshit idea enters mainstream consciousness, the battle is already lost. The best conservatives can do is slow down the rate at which it is accepted by the populace, but its eventual acceptance is inevitable at that point.<br><br>If you look back on history, our overall movement has been towards the left rather than the right.","filename":"8fjd52bf","ext":".jpg","w":745,"h":1119,"tn_w":166,"tn_h":250,"tim":1490185111120,"time":1490185111,"md5":"XgroyT4VetXH9kz8t1hwOw==","fsize":117914,"resto":0,"id":"A6ARSFPJ","country":"GB","m_img":1,"bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"how-do-you-deal-with-the-fact-that-youre","country_name":"United Kingdom","replies":64,"images":17,"omitted_posts":59,"omitted_images":15},{"no":117777211,"now":"03\/22\/17(Wed)11:49:46","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p117774934\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;117774934<\/a><br>Hey Sonic the Edgehog, you missed a step. <br><br>Power - &gt; technology &gt; society &gt; culture","time":1490197786,"resto":117752508,"id":"Fc\/78FqM","country":"CA","country_name":"Canada"},{"no":117777486,"now":"03\/22\/17(Wed)11:51:13","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p117774784\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;117774784<\/a><br>Not an argument","time":1490197873,"resto":117752508,"id":"5iqx7MSV","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":117778809,"now":"03\/22\/17(Wed)11:56:35","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p117755849\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;117755849<\/a><br>Nice Nordic flag.<br><br>Now go hide in a white state bragging about fucking Leonidas with open borders, bitch.","time":1490198195,"resto":117752508,"id":"m1sFC5Ed","country":"FR","country_name":"France"},{"no":117778865,"now":"03\/22\/17(Wed)11:56:57","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p117777486\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;117777486<\/a><br>---&gt; <a href=\"#p117774395\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;117774395<\/a>","time":1490198217,"resto":117752508,"id":"avt12sL1","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":117779231,"now":"03\/22\/17(Wed)11:59:00","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p117752508\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;117752508<\/a><br>trying not to think about it too much","filename":"1455082674207","ext":".jpg","w":633,"h":758,"tn_w":104,"tn_h":125,"tim":1490198340691,"time":1490198340,"md5":"wSzi0c8SuIhZ3C7pqwgJfg==","fsize":150830,"resto":117752508,"id":"9LajcXdZ","country":"SE","country_name":"Sweden"}]},{"posts":[{"no":117779227,"now":"03\/22\/17(Wed)11:58:58","name":"Anonymous","com":"You what now ?","filename":"1490163960989","ext":".jpg","w":1536,"h":2048,"tn_w":187,"tn_h":250,"tim":1490198338791,"time":1490198338,"md5":"0J1vn5QWK70QFG0bRste0g==","fsize":1067373,"resto":0,"id":"6vxRhfT9","country":"TN","m_img":1,"bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"you-what-now","country_name":"Tunisia","replies":0,"images":0}]},{"posts":[{"no":117761486,"now":"03\/22\/17(Wed)10:07:37","name":"Anonymous","com":"Reminder that these are the people who created the term &quot;redpill&quot;.","filename":"XLjjuWC","ext":".png","w":975,"h":650,"tn_w":249,"tn_h":166,"tim":1490191657473,"time":1490191657,"md5":"AZyQ96GwTludWAmO3uD9Zg==","fsize":861890,"resto":0,"id":"Kgrug6sv","country":"BR","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"reminder-that-these-are-the-people-who-created","country_name":"Brazil","replies":54,"images":13,"omitted_posts":49,"omitted_images":12},{"no":117773784,"now":"03\/22\/17(Wed)11:31:42","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p117770898\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;117770898<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Keanu Reeves has been dating a tranny for almost 2 years<\/span><br><br>there goes an idol","time":1490196702,"resto":117761486,"id":"x37YvGGj","country":"AR","country_name":"Argentina"},{"no":117774193,"now":"03\/22\/17(Wed)11:33:40","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p117773784\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;117773784<\/a><br><a href=\"#p117770898\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;117770898<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;unaware of your idol smooching all over a tranny on video<\/span><br><br>https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=rZA<wbr>1A28CkTQ","time":1490196820,"resto":117761486,"id":"yK+lFMGA","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":117774545,"now":"03\/22\/17(Wed)11:35:23","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p117761486\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;117761486<\/a><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt; the people who created the term &quot;redpill&quot;<\/span><br><br>bullshit.

I obviously didn&#039;t make the thread then, because I didn&#039;t want to be lumped in with CTR; however, I think the smoke has cleared enough to have a somewhat nuanced discussion on the subject.<br><br>Basically, is it a positive change, long-run, that SJWs hold no cultural power and the Right is on the rise?<br><br>Sure Trump&#039;s good in a number of ways, he&#039;s the best Republican candidate to run since Pat Buchanan. SJWs are awful people with awful ideas, and any power they wield ultimately harms society. These things are objectively true, but look at the response from the general public.<br><br>Most people really don&#039;t care about SJWs outside of the internet. The problem with the new progressives is that they left the incubator of academia early and met the public far before they had proper academic grounding. That resulted in most people ignoring them, and others taking the piss out of them. Most people can honestly say that they&#039;ve never met an SJW, and many of those that have interacted with them in some form or another haven&#039;t really been pushed to the right at all. Instead we get cultural libertarians and the like (Sargon of Akkad, Paul Joseph Watson, etc.) forming a good chunk of the resistance.<br><br>These people have also been huge proponents of the Trump phenomenon. Don&#039;t get me wrong, part of me is enthused that he won; however, I feel like we&#039;re seeing a repeat of the 80s all over again.<br><br>1\/2","filename":"1459001992240","ext":".jpg","w":600,"h":600,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":250,"tim":1490195655905,"time":1490195655,"md5":"bubgNUYHnbwzjrcfobANsA==","fsize":124974,"resto":0,"id":"C2P77MOX","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"is-anyone-else-sad-to-see-that-sjws-are-a","country_name":"United States","replies":31,"images":7,"omitted_posts":26,"omitted_images":4},{"no":117778695,"now":"03\/22\/17(Wed)11:55:58","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p117778082\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;117778082<\/a><br>Yes, but the alt-right generally tends to be more on the nose with it&#039;s method of attacking people.","time":1490198158,"resto":117770457,"id":"sXacwaNR","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":117779021,"now":"03\/22\/17(Wed)11:57:47","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p117778695\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;117778695<\/a><br><br>Substantiate your claims or fuck off.<br><br>Literally every group has people that are terrible human beings and unless you can prove in any sort of way that the &quot;alt-right&quot; is worse than any other group then all you&#039;re doing is spouting bullshit based on your misguided beliefs.","time":1490198267,"resto":117770457,"id":"+wzyC1Y+","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":117779037,"now":"03\/22\/17(Wed)11:57:53","name":"Anonymous","com":"OP is same paid shills as always<br><br>earlier threads were about &#039;now ethnonationalism will lose its bite&#039;<br><br>sage goes in options field to prevent bumps","time":1490198273,"resto":117770457,"id":"W8fLLzaW","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":117779146,"now":"03\/22\/17(Wed)11:58:30","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p117770457\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;117770457<\/a><br>I posted before Trump won, that it would be bad for the Right if he does badly as President, and the left will get more powerful.

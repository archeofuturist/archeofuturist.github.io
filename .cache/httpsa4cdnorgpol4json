I have some advice that should help you. <br><br>1.) To kick the Carbonated Jew:<br>Switch from regular soda to diet soda, and then from diet soda to sparkling water, and finally drink only water. Stop drinking regular soda immediately. You will see your weight begin to drop after you switch to diet soda since it has 0 calories. Switch to sparkling water to get away from diet soda&#039;s artificial sweeteners and finally pure water for the most efficient and healthiest way to stay hydrated. <br><br>2.) To defeat your inner Hungry Jew<br><br>This one is tough. You really need to want it.<br><br>DRINK MORE WATER! Often when you feel that you are hungry you are actually dehydrated. I drink about a gallon of water every day but this is not necessary. basically if you are craving food between meals drink a massive cup of water to blunt your hunger.<br><br>You should be discriminating about the foods you eat. Seek out meat, vegetables, nuts, and fruit. You should be eating this almost exclusively. These foods are filling and relatively low in calories so it will be difficult to binge and less damaging if you manage to binge.<br><br>You could try setting an eating window for yourself if you are the type who raids the fridge late at night. Limit your eating from 8:00AM to 8:00 PM and stick to it. Late night snacking can fuck up your diet and lead to significant fat gain in the long run. <br><br>It takes months to begin to see the benefits from these habits but I promise you that they will pay off. It comes down to your discipline.","time":1490143619,"resto":117671212,"id":"VaRmDUeX","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":117696977,"now":"03\/21\/17(Tue)20:58:53","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p117695607\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;117695607<\/a><br>Best post ITT.","filename":"wow such moves","ext":".gif","w":450,"h":296,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":82,"tim":1490144333315,"time":1490144333,"md5":"RHOmhQacRbPgF2aFwZaq2g==","fsize":511241,"resto":117671212,"id":"kEDdNoMZ","country":"PT","country_name":"Portugal"}]},{"posts":[{"no":117678634,"now":"03\/21\/17(Tue)18:15:50","name":"Anonymous","sub":"\/lrg\/ LIBERTARIAN RIGHT GENERAL OUTTA FUCKING NOWHERE","com":"This thread is for Discussion of Libertarianism, Capitalism, AnarchoCapitalism, and the physical removal of communist fags from our board of peace.<br> <br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Post sneks<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Bump for Life, Liberty, and Private Death Squads<\/span><br> <br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Vanilla \/lrg\/ pastebin- CREATE IF YOU DONT SEE ONE IN THE CATALOG<\/span><br>http:\/\/pastebin.com\/7K1EJYb8<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Thread theme:<\/span><br>https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=u-w<wbr>MmYSG9JQ&amp;t=177s<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Safespace and Archive:<\/span><br>(((https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/Ansneki<wbr>stan\/)))","filename":"Flag","ext":".png","w":1000,"h":1000,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":250,"tim":1490134550614,"time":1490134550,"md5":"PA3WeOIMrjW+UQNaIVkveA==","fsize":112287,"resto":0,"id":"QbmBUenL","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"lrg-libertarian-right-general-outta-fucking","country_name":"United States","replies":105,"images":57,"omitted_posts":100,"omitted_images":55,"tail_size":50},{"no":117695315,"now":"03\/21\/17(Tue)20:44:22","name":"Anonymous","com":"<span class=\"quote\">&gt;tfw you will never be american and vote for Ron Paul<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;tfw you will never be american and vote for Rand Paul<\/span>","filename":"1489074487898","ext":".gif","w":500,"h":375,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":93,"tim":1490143462621,"time":1490143462,"md5":"e5LCtwL2p1QfWu3arGVSvw==","fsize":254708,"resto":117678634,"id":"ZkzFAFrO","country":"DE","country_name":"Germany"},{"no":117695655,"now":"03\/21\/17(Tue)20:47:21","name":"Anonymous","filename":"1488132977622","ext":".png","w":812,"h":726,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":111,"tim":1490143641072,"time":1490143641,"md5":"zPhkGzKPDLEA6j1ymW\/VzA==","fsize":58316,"resto":117678634,"id":"QbmBUenL","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":117696442,"now":"03\/21\/17(Tue)20:54:14","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p117695203\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;117695203<\/a><br>oh, so you guys are just ancaps.. thats disappointing","filename":"1466099608964","ext":".jpg","w":1098,"h":913,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":103,"tim":1490144054223,"time":1490144054,"md5":"fWagq06YEZpah6AZbvNqRg==","fsize":201944,"resto":117678634,"id":"9igrCZIQ","country":"CZ","m_img":1,"country_name":"Czech Republic"},{"no":117696795,"now":"03\/21\/17(Tue)20:57:25","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p117696442\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;117696442<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;are you saying you advocate me being shot?<\/span>","time":1490144245,"resto":117678634,"id":"QbmBUenL","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":117696975,"now":"03\/21\/17(Tue)20:58:52","name":"Anonymous","com":"Anybody torn on being a pure Ancap in favor of putting transhumanism in the mix?

And our Danish railways was pretty cool, clean, on time, polite conductors, a special carriage where you could purchace a sussage in a bun. All those little things. And once I even got to go to this far away place called Germany. OK, not so much more distant than Sweden or Norway where I had been often. But in order to get into Germany, you had to show a passport and a big-wee-boy got to hand over the whole family&#039;s passports to the stern uniformed German man at the border. And once in Germany, the joy! Getting to ride on the DB. Like our DSB, only one up! Even cleaner, even more punctual and even better susages. Now our railways have gone to shit. Mostly because some EU regulations means the technical parts are mostly done by Italians, so reliability and punctuality is gone.<br>Haven&#039;t been on the DB for a long time, but if they use their budget to make &quot;more time for tolerance&quot; propaganda instead on using them on rails, trains and skilled personel. Then I guess DB is going to shit as well.

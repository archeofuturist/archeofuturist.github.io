I&#039;ve never paid any attention to politics, but 9\/11 changed that. So Michael Moore was interesting object to investigate. So i downloaded form p2p and watched all his movies and tv shows that he ever produced. They were quite refreshing in comparison to all this hysteria and foxnews. Even Bill O&#039;Reilly sounded to me like a voice of reason. So one evening after he was exiting the bathroom and walking by the pantry station i told him that i&#039;m his big fan and i&#039;ve watched all his material. You know what was his responce - where did you get it as if i did something wrong. That was strange to me, not because he didn&#039;t care about fans. He sounded concerned as if I didn&#039;t pay for it or something like that.

She predicted Donald Trump would become President and would use her Twitter account to relay what she claimed were messages from God that only enlightened human beings would be able to understand, one of them being that the past present and future are not sequences of events one after another but are actually all happening at the same time. Another was that there is an infinite number of universes in which every detail can be infinitely different. Also, she tried to kill herself in 2012 and claimed that she succeeded but that successfully killing yourself will only result in your consciousness being shifted into another universe in which you become another &quot;you&quot; who survived your own suicide attempt, but are still in the same life situation that you experienced before your attempt. Since then Tila claims to have developed a special relationship with God by which she can receive messages to share with the public. Interestingly, she does not claim to be God himself, but tells her fans to follow Jesus so as to dissuade a personality cult. She consistently criticizes (((Them))) in her videos and also claims that she has the power to alter our universe with her mind. Most importantly, she is now claiming the return of Jesus is imminent with the coming of a third world war.<br><br>Two videos for the intrigued:<br><br>&quot;A Recap on World War 3!

The survivability of airbases in the event of a mass surface-to-surface missile attack is also open to question. One possibility is that no large-scale air battles would materialize.<br><br>The two key limitations are logistical: lack of internal fuel to operate without support, and insufficient missiles to tackle superior numbers. For the time being, there is no obvious fix to the fuel problem: the latest U.S. fighters, the F-22 and F-35, are simply going to depend on tankers. Some suggest that the Navy should deploy light-weight low-observable drones from carriers that could potentially operate further afield.<br><br>What about increasing missile capacity?<br><br>The U.S. military is a big proponent of networked warfare. In theory, if one airplane detects an enemy, it could pass on that data to friendly ships and aircraft\u2014and through Cooperative Engagement Ability, even potentially allow those friendlies to shoot at that target from far away. One potential tactic is to use a vanguard of stealthy fighters to identify incoming enemy aircraft and send targeting data to ships or non-stealth fighters, which can carry heavier weapons loads. The F-35\u2019s excellent sensors and datalinks could make it effective in this role.<br><br>There is even an idea being kicked around to mount large numbers of missiles on a B-1 or B-52, which would be fired off hundreds of kilometers away from the battle. Of course, such an \u201carsenal plane\u201d would be vulnerable if enemy fighters broke through the accompanying line of F-22s and F-35s. The tactic would likely require even longer-range missiles than the U.S. currently employs.","filename":"Screen Shot 2017-04-13 at 1.07.39 PM","ext":".png","w":1480,"h":1166,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":196,"tim":1492082181369,"time":1492082181,"md5":"Z6Q6nlRqVo1WyBY1IrfkIg==","fsize":1604325,"resto":0,"id":"\/jFzrKaA","country":"DE","m_img":1,"bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"were-the-f22-and-f35-a-mistake","country_name":"Germany","replies":249,"images":53,"omitted_posts":244,"omitted_images":51,"tail_size":50},{"no":120917874,"now":"04\/13\/17(Thu)10:53:35","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120917692\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120917692<\/a><br>So it didn&#039;t outclass?<br><br>Considering F-22 line ended because of its price I&#039;d say it was a good decision.","time":1492095215,"resto":120898294,"id":"JJy6xkhB","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":120917918,"now":"04\/13\/17(Thu)10:53:59","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120900962\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120900962<\/a><br>oy vey","time":1492095239,"resto":120898294,"id":"9+f7iCPd","country":"AU","country_name":"Australia"},{"no":120918105,"now":"04\/13\/17(Thu)10:55:43","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120917692\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120917692<\/a><br>It probably had more to do with the proposal for how to construct the f-35.

This server has been mentioned in connection to investigations.<br><br>* Nobody knew who TeaLeaves was. Some speculated it was L Jean Camp herself which is the closest guess. It turned out to be a colleague of hers. See the info above for the damning proof. <br><br>* Tealeaves has a years-old wordpress account coincidentally named in leetspeak teakettle (t34k3ttl3). That&#039;s him. BTW I don&#039;t believe that FeelTheEmailMistake guy found it the way he says. I think he had to present it in a more eh &quot;public safe&quot; manner if you get my drift. Based on some other posts of his i think this guy is into some seriously heavy shit...and think about the timing of all this.<br><br>* The DNS logs contain + signs -- meaning recursive nameserver-nameserver queries which just doesnt happen. Even if we say the Russian nameservers have some weird setup -- well, the American medical nameservers have the same weird setup. Every damn nameserver has the same weird setup. Terribly unlikely...<br><br>* The guy mentions 6 indicators of forgery... says hes only &#039;reasonably confident&#039; based on the indicator above... but it&#039;s pretty fucking damning all by itself. My suspicion is that another indicator is based on meticulous analysis of TTLS and cache behavior.","filename":"WorldBurn","ext":".jpg","w":640,"h":640,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":250,"tim":1490468909251,"time":1490468909,"md5":"kdOYl3238N7GDEwZejU\/yQ==","fsize":44242,"resto":0,"id":"wyUytZpn","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"clinton-crony-forged-dns-logs-for-russia","country_name":"United States","replies":246,"images":59,"omitted_posts":241,"omitted_images":58,"tail_size":50},{"no":118309033,"now":"03\/25\/17(Sat)22:37:39","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118258574\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118258574<\/a><br>someone reup when hits limit","time":1490495859,"resto":118258574,"id":"cyrxxwd8","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":118309124,"now":"03\/25\/17(Sat)22:38:31","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118258574\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118258574<\/a><br>This explains the shill slide threads.

Pizzagate: BAMN is Selling Teens on the Black Market to Fund Their Organization","com":"<span class=\"quote\">&gt;Beneath the surface of the political organization, BAMN (By Any Means Necessary) is an organization of human traffickers, who groom and eventually coerce young teens to run away from their parents. <\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;BAMN has convinced children as young as fourteen to run away from home (secretsurvivorsofbamn.wordpress.co<wbr>m), and are often provided transportation out of state to a BAMN safehouse. <\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Children at the safehouse are either sold on the black market or used as political fodder when the child reaches the age of sixteen or seventeen (depending on state). <\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;The proceeds from the sale of underage children on the black market goes towards partially towards funding the organization and the rest goes into the BAMN house leader&#039;s pockets. <\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;If the child has not been trafficked by the age of emancipation, the organization will have the child legally emancipated from their parents if they have not already sold them.<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;The children who are not sold are transported again, placed into the home of a BAMN leader, who will use them as political fodder at left wing rallies.<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;According to BAMN survivors, they are not allowed to contact their friends, family, or go back home. <\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;BAMN may be related to many human trafficking cases, as well as emotional, sexual, and physical abuse of teens throughout the country. <\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Their main network of kidnapping teens is primarily set up in Detroit, MI; however, they have begun to develop networks in other major cities including. <\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Do not let these people continue to conduct their human trafficking of teens under the guise of a political movement; urge the FBI to investigate

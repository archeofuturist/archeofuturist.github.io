And Eris called the morality \u201cConservatism\u201d, and the degeneracy he called \u201cLiberalism\u201d. And Eris said, Let there be a firmament between the ideologies, and let it divide the ideologies of the Earth from the ideologies of Space. And Eris made the firmament, and divided the ideologies which were under the firmament from the ideologies which were above the firmament: and it was so. And Eris called the firmament The Free Market. And the evening and the morning were the second day. And Eris said, Let the conservatives under the heaven be gathered together unto one place, and let the degenerates be segregated: and it was so. And Eris called the segregated peoples the \u201cDemocrats\u201d; and the gathering together of the conservatives called the \u201cRepublicans\u201d: and Eris saw that it was good. And Eris said, Let the Republicans bring forth morals , the morals yielding Christianity, and Christianity yielding devoutness after his kind: and it was so. And the Democrats brought forth communism, and communism yielding atheism after his kind, and the atheism yielding degeneracy: and Eris saw that it was bad.

The Russians briefed the United States on the proposed target. This is a process that started more than two months ago. There is a dedicated phone line that is being used to coordinate and deconflict (i.e., prevent US and Russian air assets from shooting at each other) the upcoming operation.<br><br>2. The United States was fully briefed on the fact that there was a target in Idlib that the Russians believes was a weapons\/explosives depot for Islamic rebels.<br><br>3. The Syrian Air Force hit the target with conventional weapons. All involved expected to see a massive secondary explosion. That did not happen. Instead, smoke, chemical smoke, began billowing from the site. It turns out that the Islamic rebels used that site to store chemicals, not sarin, that were deadly. The chemicals included organic phosphates and chlorine and they followed the wind and killed civilians.<br><br>4. There was a strong wind blowing that day and the cloud was driven to a nearby village and caused casualties.<br><br>5. We know it was not sarin. How? Very simple. The so-called \u201cfirst responders\u201d handled the victims without gloves. If this had been sarin they would have died. Sarin on the skin will kill you. How do I know?

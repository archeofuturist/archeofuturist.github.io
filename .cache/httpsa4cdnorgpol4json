Much of the ethnic tensions that still exist in Europe can be sourced from very old and very bitter rivalries. In some sense it could be argued America gets used but it absolutely must stop *acting* like it has the inside track on the complexities that riddle European ethnic cultures and divides. When America stops regarding the old country as quaint and old fashioned, and begins to recognise that minutiae matter, America will have begun to mature as a nation state and it will see that the lessons learned in Europe could prevent Balkanization in America. Let&#039;s be clear, I believe America to hold the key to humanities future but it&#039;s like watching a smart kid in school whose brains have gone to his head.<br><br>I fully see how if it wasn&#039;t America being the active ingredient in appearing to destablise the world it would be another actor but it is America so all discussion about what *could* be is moot. America needs to start behaving with integrity and honour, Putin has been playing you for a fool and it&#039;s causing people to turn their backs on you. You&#039;re simply not winning and what&#039;s worse you seem to be just trying random shit in the hope it will work somehow. The chemistry that made America work can&#039;t apply to centuries and millennia old cultures, the hope and optimism that you used to personify, the hoaky jovial enthusiasm that carried you through doesn&#039;t apply where reality has been shaped and cultivated to BE, over thousands of years.

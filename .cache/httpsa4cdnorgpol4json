Some went there as much as 100 times or more. Some of the women\u2019s conduct was limited to performing a topless or nude massage while Mr. Epstein masturbated himself. For other women, the conduct escalated to full sexual intercourse.\u201d<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;In the 2011 letter explaining his decision in the Epstein case, Acosta said he backed off from pressing charges after \u201ca year-long assault on the prosecution and the prosecutors\u201d by \u201can army of legal superstars\u201d who represented Epstein, including Harvard Law professor Alan Dershowitz; Kenneth Starr, who as independent counsel led the investigation that brought about President Bill Clinton\u2019s impeachment; and some of the nation\u2019s most prominent defense attorneys, such as Roy Black, Gerald Lefcourt and Jay Lefkowitz.<\/span>","filename":"pizzagate ramsay","ext":".png","w":1764,"h":1440,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":204,"tim":1490146878270,"time":1490146878,"md5":"vDYdGfr27McHwaqN33FoVA==","fsize":2552507,"resto":0,"id":"IzeoanzV","country":"US","m_img":1,"bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"pzzagate-is-back-in-the-news","country_name":"United States","replies":70,"images":31,"omitted_posts":65,"omitted_images":29},{"no":117709314,"now":"03\/21\/17(Tue)22:49:11","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p117708642\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;117708642<\/a><br>Yeah, I think the one in black is just an aide though.<br>Here&#039;s the cult leader Choi Soon-SiL","filename":"2243","ext":".jpg","w":620,"h":372,"tn_w":124,"tn_h":75,"tim":1490150951242,"time":1490150951,"md5":"wHg6ur\/H4jA1mSxncwhynw==","fsize":49629,"resto":117701692,"id":"Valc3H7w","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":117709367,"now":"03\/21\/17(Tue)22:49:44","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p117704232\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;117704232<\/a><br>Is this how the swamp gets drained?

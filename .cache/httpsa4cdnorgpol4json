Multiple interracial relationships in 18th century France.<br>2.Lefou breaks from the original gaston song to announce that he is illiterate. <br>2. Librarian is black, makes confused face when the illiterate and uneducated whites go off to kill the beast. <br>3. Scene where a man tells belle to stop teaching a little girl to learn how to read. <br>4. Lefou has a homosexual crush on Gaston<br>5. Castle attacker forcibly dressed 3 men in women&#039;s clothes. One attacker smiles flirtatiously seeming enjoying cross-dressing.<br><br>I know why, but I still have to ask, why does Hollywood want to ruin great movies by adding garbage to them in the name of diversity, current political ideologies, etc?<br><br>The original Beauty and the Beast is a great movie, and actually the first movie I ever saw in theaters as a kid.

Mulattoes are almost never accepted as white, so they instead identify entirely as black rather than mixed race. Mixed race Asians are a fairly recent phenomenon, but hapa children of Europeans and Asians have historically never been accepted in Asian countries: for example, Indo-Dutch children were persecuted after the end of Dutch occupation, and many Viet-American babies of US soldiers had to be brought to America because they would be ostracized in Vietnam.<br><br>Because neither whites nor asians are welcoming of the racially impure, hapas are left without any racial identity at all. This is why Hapa males are rightfully stereotyped as being &quot;beta&quot;: never fully accepted by either group, they never truly &quot;belong&quot; anywhere. It is commonly thought that female hapas escape this complex, but I suspect this is simply because most hapa women are so attractive that they never experience any kind of discrimination. <br><br>Hapa males are not genetically inferior; they are only conditioned to believe that they are inferior because of their inability to feel racial pride.","filename":"1478054779442","ext":".png","w":537,"h":525,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":244,"tim":1490069143529,"time":1490069143,"md5":"8k+FW6w1F7Zlc07nhHFlQg==","fsize":106478,"resto":0,"id":"6Y7fTx1I","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"the-reason-why-hapa-males-are-beta","country_name":"United States","replies":15,"images":2,"omitted_posts":10,"omitted_images":1},{"no":117586066,"now":"03\/21\/17(Tue)00:21:55","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p117585029\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;117585029<\/a><br>criminally underrated post","time":1490070115,"resto":117584389,"id":"IryI+QM7","country":"CA","country_name":"Canada"},{"no":117586176,"now":"03\/21\/17(Tue)00:22:53","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p117585812\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;117585812<\/a><br>He was definitely on the handsome end of hapas, but hapas still look &#039;&#039;weird&#039;&#039;, different, from either whites and asians.

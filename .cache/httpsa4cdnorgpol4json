I see a lot of people claiming their firewall or traffic analyzer can detect a compromise, this is not true. Way too high up the protocol stack, these exploits are going on at the hardware level and stolen data can easily be held, wrapped in legitimate traffic and sent at a later date. You could be staring at the raw packet data and still not recognize the exploit. The only real way is comparison testing with known good hardware so it&#039;s a catch 22. Even then should you detect a difference it takes much work to figure out what is compromised and what is good. You can try and dump the raw code out of a piece of hardware but there may be mechanisms in place to foil that method. Also, all ROM&#039;s are EEPROMS and have been for years, the code is dynamic and there could be mechanisms in place to detect a pentest, malware scan - whatever and have the exploit disappear - self delete - and simply be reloaded remotely at a later date.","time":1490248597,"resto":117886401,"id":"RFUqzepM","country":"CA","country_name":"Canada"},{"no":117896125,"now":"03\/23\/17(Thu)01:57:13","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p117889131\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;117889131<\/a><br>why is that fake news?","time":1490248633,"resto":117886401,"id":"AGGyRqvx","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":117896236,"now":"03\/23\/17(Thu)01:58:12","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p117893325\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;117893325<\/a><br>a) Does DAL still allow test\/dev certs in production?<br>b) Does the flash on the ARC still support the fixed table huffman encoding?","time":1490248692,"resto":117886401,"id":"Ch8zLS46","country":"US","country_name":"United States"}]},{"posts":[{"no":117896234,"now":"03\/23\/17(Thu)01:58:12","name":"Anonymous","sub":"Big black bully attacks Asian kid, gets its leg broken","com":"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=n8X<wbr>cGYkCg8w<br> <br>Nigger taunts Asian guy, Asian guy told him &quot;leave me alone&quot;, Nigger briefly pins Asian using size advantage, Asian kid flips him over and groid&#039;s leg is broken!<br><br>The hilariously stupid thing is, in the lead up to the attack, groid kept taunting the Asian as &quot;You think you&#039;re Jackie Chan?!

Hans listened to his grandfather and was terrified of the Russians. One day, my bicycle was gone. I later learned that he&#039;d stolen it and went west to surrender to the Americans. Lucas thought that the Russians couldn&#039;t be as monstrous as Hitler said, and didn&#039;t run. He was shot in the streets along with his mother.&quot;<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;&quot;When the Russians arrived, they were merciless. Evil and cruel.

I played there as a little girl, but after 1945 we called it the Rape Field. The Russians would take any woman or girl they wanted, dragged her there, and did whatever they wanted. I saw little girls and old ladies get raped. Mrs. Weber, she was as old then as I am now, was literally raped to death. Then when they were done, the Russians would release you back into the city, sometimes.&quot;<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;&quot;One day, some Americans heard about the field. I don&#039;t know how. They arrived in a truck and started screaming at the Russians. I don&#039;t speak English, but I could tell they wanted us released. I thought &#039;at last! We&#039;re saved! Thank God for America! They aren&#039;t savage like these Russians!&#039; Then the Russians screamed back in their dog tongue and fired into the air, and the Americans got scared and drove away.

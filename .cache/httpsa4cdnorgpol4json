Women where never ever ever stay at home mothers in pols retarded way of thinking of it. women had work in textiles and other industries like agriculture and certain trade goods and even writing. Industrialization made these skills uncompetitive for the most part and they where forced to work along side men in factories until the labor started to be so automated that the middle class truly opened up, this lead directly into the kind of house wife every retarded moron in this board thinks of when the word is brought up and that house wife was born to die becuase feminism is the natural reaction to a bunch of women surrounded by a boring life and cultural hatred of them for being inferior born of men having to actually work for a living to support both of them. Both the men and women hated this<br><br>These days thanks to feminism making it possible for us to find careers and the development in the internet and other buisness platforms, there has never been a better time in the last 300 years to be a house wife. You can make small luxuries at home, telecommute, blog, produce entertainment content, and a million other avenues.

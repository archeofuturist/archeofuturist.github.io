I grew up never wanting any, and I&#039;m still not thrilled of the idea, but I know the importance of having stable, white families and communities in the future. I&#039;m 25 now, I&#039;m with the person who I&#039;ll probably marry, yet not financially stable nor mentally ready to have kids. Anyone here a parent? Anyone going through the same dilemma as me?

Be proud that you are stepping up to the plate. It&#039;s a real tough area to be in. But you really have to help those who help you until you can secure an apartment for yourself. As a father of 3 kids, 1 premature, 1 normal, and 1 fatty big when born, I can say that having kids is both wonderful and burdensome. But you don&#039;t truly become alive and become a human until your kids start to develop memories of you. Only until then are your actions actually inscribed in memory. I ask my kids what they remembered about their childhood, and they say things that they remember and did and it&#039;s always planned things or events we did.

After work today, I went out and bought it. After playing for a few hours I am deeply disturbed by how this game portrays Christians, especially Christians living in America.<br><br>You basically play the role of a guy who was in an accident with your wife close to this Christian community. But you soon find out that these Christians are insane, violent zealots who have taken all violence in the Bible and focused their interpretation of Christianity around the violence.<br><br>I find this scenario hilarious for several reasons.<br><br>1. The creators of the game obviously have a negative view of Christianity since the whole point of the game is to make Christians seem like violent psychopaths.<br><br>2. If they were to create the very same game, but based around insane, violent zealots of Islam, there would be massive public backlash for &#039;islamaphobia&#039;. Yet, in real life , the Muslims are the actual ones who have twisted their ideology into a violent, zealot cult. <br><br>So what the game is trying to portray Christians as, is what Muslims truly are. Yet if the game was about Islam and not Christianity, every fucking liberal media outlet would be bashing this game.<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt; Well who cares? Why is it a big deal?<\/span><br><br>It&#039;s a big deal because not only is Christianity assaulted on almost every front, such as in Hollywood and their movies, and the attacks on Christmas and Christian holidays, but they are now using videos games to indoctrinate people into the idea that Christianity is for crazy people, buy Islam is a progressive, liberal religion .<br><br>Just some food for thought.","filename":"Outlast_2_adiado_2017","ext":".jpg","w":960,"h":540,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":140,"tim":1493693978640,"time":1493693978,"md5":"qFOGYhqbzxU+tzmtm3aTXQ==","fsize":77984,"resto":0,"id":"KqsenIJm","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"outlast-an-assault-on-christianity","country_name":"United States","replies":12,"images":2,"omitted_posts":7,"omitted_images":1},{"no":123721069,"now":"05\/01\/17(Mon)23:40:44","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123717007\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123717007<\/a><br><a href=\"#p123718115\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123718115<\/a><br><br>But the point is that this is based on an agenda to hurt the already damaged image of Christianity.

In Libya a home is considered a natural human right<\/span><br>In Gaddafi\u2019s Green Book it states: \u201dThe house is a basic need of both the individual and the family, therefore it should not be owned by others\u201d. Gaddafi\u2019s Green Book is the formal leader\u2019s political philosophy, it was first published in 1975 and was intended reading for all Libyans even being included in the national curriculum.<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;2. Education and medical treatment were all free<\/span><br>Under Gaddafi, Libya could boast one of the best healthcare services in the Middle East and Africa. Also if a Libyan citizen could not access the desired educational course or correct medical treatment in Libya they were funded to go abroad.<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;3. Gaddafi carried out the world\u2019s largest irrigation project<\/span><br>The largest irrigation system in the world also known as the great manmade river was designed to make water readily available to all Libyan\u2019s across the entire country. It was funded by the Gaddafi government and it said that Gaddafi himself called it \u201dthe eighth wonder of the world\u201d.<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;4. It was free to start a farming business<\/span><br>If any Libyan wanted to start a farm they were given a house, farm land and live stock and seeds all free of charge.<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;5. A bursary was given to mothers with newborn babies<\/span><br>When a Libyan woman gave birth she was given 5000 (US dollars) for herself and the child.<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;6. Electricity was free<\/span><br>Electricity was free in Libya meaning absolutely no electric bills!<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;7. Cheap petrol<\/span><br>During Gaddafi\u2019s reign the price of petrol in Libya was as low as 0.14 (US dollars) per litre.<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;8. Gaddafi raised the level of education<\/span><br>Before Gaddafi only 25% of Libyans were literate. This figure was brought up to 87% with 25% earning university degrees.<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;9. Libya had It\u2019s own state bank<\/span><br>Libya had its own State bank, which provided loans to citizens at zero percent interest by law and they had no external debt.","time":1493355467,"resto":123148871,"id":"KwZ4t3bw","country":"CL","country_name":"Chile"},{"no":123150102,"now":"04\/28\/17(Fri)00:58:27","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123148871\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123148871<\/a><br><br>Jews deleted this video.

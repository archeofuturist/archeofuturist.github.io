So last week, Mr. Jarlstrom filed a civil rights lawsuit in federal court against the Oregon State Board of Examiners for Engineering and Land Surveying, charging the state\u2019s licensing panel with violating his First Amendment rights.<br><br>\u201cI was working with simple mathematics and applying it to the motion of a vehicle and explaining my research,\u201d said Mr. Jarlstrom, 56. \u201cBy doing so, they declared I was illegal.\u201d<br><br>The lawsuit is the latest and perhaps most novel shot in the continuing campaign against the proliferation of state licensing laws that can require costly training and fees before people can work. Mr. Jarlstrom is being represented by the Institute for Justice, a libertarian organization partly funded by the billionaire brothers and activists Charles G. and David H. Koch.<br><br>Mr. Jarlstrom does not have an engineering license issued by the state board. He is a self-employed consultant who tests audio products and repairs, upgrades and calibrates test instruments. But he did earn a bachelor\u2019s degree in electronics engineering in Sweden, where he was born. He has also spent a couple of years researching traffic light timing intervals, which included consulting with one of authors of the original 1959 mathematical formula used as a basis for programming traffic light signals.<br><br>Nonetheless, the Oregon board, after a nearly two-year investigation, assessed a $500 civil penalty because Mr. Jarlstrom called himself \u201can excellent engineer\u201d in one of several emails to the board and informed the Washington County sheriff that he \u201cinvented and publicly released a new extended solution\u201d to the problem of yellow lights in traffic flow.","filename":"trafficlight","ext":".jpg","w":484,"h":348,"tn_w":249,"tn_h":179,"tim":1493636853675,"time":1493636853,"md5":"3BC8o\/iGty57K88039XwsA==","fsize":20896,"resto":0,"id":"e6Ed0erY","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"oregon-man-fined-for-complaining-about-traffic","country_name":"United States","replies":5,"images":0},{"no":123608367,"now":"05\/01\/17(Mon)07:16:00","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123607724\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123607724<\/a><br>bump","time":1493637360,"resto":123607724,"id":"e6Ed0erY","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":123608392,"now":"05\/01\/17(Mon)07:16:22","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123607724\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123607724<\/a><br>bump","time":1493637382,"resto":123607724,"id":"oiTnRpk0","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":123608540,"now":"05\/01\/17(Mon)07:18:19","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123607724\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123607724<\/a><br>There&#039;s some background to this -- for those of you who didn&#039;t know.<br><br>The US and Canada(only 2 I know of) have strictly defined what an engineer is.

The fossil records doesn&#039;t prove it. Most transitional fossils and intermediate forms were shown to be forgeries (and some are still in present evolution books) others are massive extrapolations (determining the entire body of animal based off a small piece of jaw bone). Most evolutionists disagree on certain features of evolution (see the Altenberg 16). Academia is unreliable and peer-review is all about enforcing group think. Evolution is the foundation for atheism and as Dawkins said if it evolution made it possible to be an intellectually fulfilled atheist. It is thus inherently socialistic, in that socialists\/Marxists believe in shaping man through statism and big government (much like fascists) since we are determined by our environment we can be changed by our environment. <br><br>There is also the fact that all evidence of evolution is bacteria where certain mutations turn off certain bodily functions. There isn&#039;t any evidence that mutations add genetic information. This is what underpins evolution.

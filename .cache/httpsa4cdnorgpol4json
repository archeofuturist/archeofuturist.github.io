Gen Y started with the phenomenon of commonplace technology in universities and jobs (ex: Compuserve in the 1980\u2019s up till mid 1990\u2019s) however it didn\u2019t become a household norm until the 2000\u2019s (every fag having a phone\/computer). To put in perspective, someone born in 1980 is still a borderline millennial. Being born in 1980 means you are only 13 years of age by 1993, in time for the election of Bill Clinton. Regular 13 year olds cannot vote, don\u2019t have a wide range of political knowledge and most certainly don\u2019t have global knowledge outside basic schooling simply due to the amount of years they\u2019ve been alive. In terms of \u201cchildhood\u201d, it is divided into baby, toddler (walking), early childhood, middle childhood and adolescence childhood (puberty-post puberty). Now most of you fuckers barely remember anything before age 8 so anything before toddler is eliminated. When people refer to their childhood, they usually mean school age aka early-middle childhood (kids aged 8-13) because in high school they become edgy faggots that call everything older than a year their \u201cchildhood\u201d. That\u2019s where \u201cchildhood is composed\u201d. Just because you watched a couple 90&#039;s cartoons and played with some colorful springs as a 10 year old doesn&#039;t mean you aren\u2019t a millennial.

Common sense tells us that they reject the accusation of being Ochlocratic, but not what arguments they deploy, if they even think it necessary to reply to the charge. The charge was originally described as a &#039;popular misconception&#039; (or some similar expression), but that seems unlikely, partly because Ochlocratic (as distinct from &#039;mob rule&#039;) is not a word in most people&#039;s vocabulary, and Anarchism is not a subject that greatly occupies most people&#039;s minds, and partly because the term &#039;anarchy&#039; conjures up in most people&#039;s minds many problems far worse than mere mob rule, such as tyranny by local bandits or warlords, economic collapse followed by starvation, and so on. So anarchists may not necessarily feel any great need to answer that particular charge. And if they do answer it, they would quite likely avoid incomprehensible waffle about &#039;theories of structure and mutual support rooted in democracy and free association&#039; in favour of something much simpler such as &#039;we anarchists object to being ruled, so what makes you think we are trying to get ourselves ruled by mobs?&#039;.

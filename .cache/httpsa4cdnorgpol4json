And legislation not passing while holding Congress and the Presidency hurts everyone. <br><br>I disagree on the notion that Trump needs to cater his policy to them. His ascent in the election was indicative of where many Republicans want the party to go. Therefore Republicans in office should cater to this voice lest they lose the interest of Trump&#039;s base.","time":1490916523,"resto":118958826,"id":"Q\/K0V6Pd","country":"US","country_name":"United States"}]},{"posts":[{"no":118979160,"now":"03\/30\/17(Thu)18:33:06","name":"Anonymous","sub":"The Factions of the Right","com":"Which do you usually see eye to eye with?","filename":"factions of the right","ext":".png","w":1250,"h":840,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":168,"tim":1490913186318,"time":1490913186,"md5":"+sxys3lBBLaLEkxkdh0w6A==","fsize":1566919,"resto":0,"id":"ucwspCQd","country":"GB","m_img":1,"bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"the-factions-of-the-right","country_name":"United Kingdom","replies":34,"images":6,"omitted_posts":29,"omitted_images":5},{"no":118985607,"now":"03\/30\/17(Thu)19:21:10","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118979160\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118979160<\/a><br><br>where all the black lines are","time":1490916070,"resto":118979160,"id":"P2hE\/U5T","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":118986328,"now":"03\/30\/17(Thu)19:26:59","name":"Anonymous","com":"Well I&#039;m alt-right\/fascist so whatever. <br><br>x get gassed","filename":"wwww","ext":".png","w":1250,"h":840,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":84,"tim":1490916419250,"time":1490916419,"md5":"yPLpYV9qVGXCtf8Xc8ctpg==","fsize":1482379,"resto":118979160,"id":"FrEDA+Tv","country":"US","m_img":1,"country_name":"United States"},{"no":118986428,"now":"03\/30\/17(Thu)19:27:49","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"\/pol\/thread\/118981149#p118981149\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118981149<\/a> \u2192<br><a href=\"\/pol\/thread\/118981149#p118981149\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118981149<\/a> \u2192<br><a href=\"\/pol\/thread\/118981149#p118981149\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118981149<\/a> \u2192<br>EVERYBODY GET IN HERE NOW<br><br>LEFTIST ORGANIZATION RUN BY TWO JEWS TO ASTROTURF TRUMP RESISTANCE<br><br>https:\/\/www.indivisibleguide.com\/<br>http:\/\/dailysignal.com\/2017\/02\/10\/i<wbr>ndivisible-with-ties-to-george-soro<wbr>s-sows-division-against-trump-gop-l<wbr>awmakers\/","time":1490916469,"resto":118979160,"id":"lh510gC9","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":118986440,"now":"03\/30\/17(Thu)19:27:56","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118979160\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118979160<\/a><br>Alt-right, but with libertarian views on economics","time":1490916476,"resto":118979160,"id":"\/CsbzFjB","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":118986538,"now":"03\/30\/17(Thu)19:28:33","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118982547\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118982547<\/a><br>you know nothing about russian politics","time":1490916513,"resto":118979160,"id":"CPUm4oao","country":"LV","country_name":"Latvia"}]},{"posts":[{"no":118980550,"now":"03\/30\/17(Thu)18:42:28","name":"Anonymous","com":"<span class=\"quote\">&gt;Bernie Sanders says it&#039;s clear Russia interfered in the election<\/span><br>Tick tock Trumpfags<br>Scared yet?","filename":"Capture","ext":".png","w":616,"h":709,"tn_w":217,"tn_h":250,"tim":1490913748323,"time":1490913748,"md5":"bdYm0MG1NWiXN33Sx+I66w==","fsize":435783,"resto":0,"id":"UEa7wUBG","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"bernie-sanders-says-its-clear-russia-interfered","country_name":"United States","replies":64,"images":13,"omitted_posts":59,"omitted_images":12},{"no":118985995,"now":"03\/30\/17(Thu)19:24:18","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118980550\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118980550<\/a><br><br>*yawns*<br><br>not really","time":1490916258,"resto":118980550,"id":"Ju27zBPF","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":118986025,"now":"03\/30\/17(Thu)19:24:37","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118980550\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118980550<\/a><br>Literally shaking. <br><br>This brave communist has us running scared.","time":1490916277,"resto":118980550,"id":"iJtN9yrh","country":"HK","country_name":"Hong Kong"},{"no":118986307,"now":"03\/30\/17(Thu)19:26:50","name":"Anonymous","com":"Someone fill me in on why this matters if they didn&#039;t manipulate the votes?

People look at you like a freak when they find out and you misinterpret their reaction 3 out of 4 times.

Society only gives you value when you inslave yourself for mathematics\/computer science. your faggoty little jamal problem is nothing to the mental abusement people with autism experiecend. We are loners because we don&#039;t know how to interact and keep a social life. We are lonely and forgotten. No one gives a shit about us and everyone expects us to just keep up with their stupid bullshit like religion. I&#039;m white myself but i&#039;m glad the white race is dying. You never cared for each other. Only for yourself. You think you are naturally smarter than others eventhough competition forced us to keep track on progress. We harm each other like no other race. For personal gain. I hate my life but i&#039;m too scared to commit suicide. I don&#039;t want to be in the bunny number anymore but i will watch you losers support the russians meme team to weaken the west and i will laugh at you. At single one of you.

Yes, lowered population will tend to result in lower GDP, just as higher population will lead to higher GDP. The mistake is using GDP as a measure of the public good, when you should be using Per Capita GDP - that is, the total GDP divided by the total population. This essentially gives you a rough average of how wealthy each individual citizen is. It isn&#039;t a perfect measure of a society&#039;s happiness, but it&#039;s much more accurate than raw GDP.<br><br>As long as the population is decreasing faster than the GDP, the per capita GDP is actually increasing. This is consistent with what&#039;s happening in Japan, where standard of living has continued to increase even as GDP has stagnated. Because population growth is ultimately limited on a finite planet, all nations will eventually face this transition from growth economies to steady-state economies where real GDP and population remain roughly constant.

You have to deal with it, whether you&#039;re more on the tribalist or globalist side.

At the same time, however, don&#039;t let that fact stop you from moving to a whiter, richer, less problematic street\/city\/country.

The exception would seem to be rich &quot;socialist&quot; countries, like Norway, but those are only viable because of the existance of a global superpower (USA), from which most technological innovation and economic progress stems. They ride on the backs of the most economically free societies and their achievements. The key is the degree of socioeconomic stratification that a society as a whole will deem acceptable. In other words, to maintain the sustainibility of a developed society, some concessions to the lower classes have to and will always be made (i.e., mo money fo dem programs).

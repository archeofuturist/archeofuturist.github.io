Hundreds injured, 86 died. Symptons point to use of nerve agent, probably Sarin based mix. US decision to strike airbase is testimony to gravity of threat, sent mssg that regime would have known already. France proposed draft resolution which is simple and balanced text that condemns attack, reaffirms UN support, and seeks verification of act. What is at stake is bring council around at key objective with is to stop CW. Beyond CW tragedy, all of Syria is landscape of devastation, cessation of hostilities by Astana process no longer exists. Regime never respected ceasefire. Regime is tightening by refusing humanitarian convoys. This is deliberate policy of prevarication, causing people to flee, in contravention of UNSC resolutions and HR law. Guarantoors of syria are responsible for all this. RU must walk its talk. Respect the Astana ceasefire and allow humanitarian assistance. We need more inclusive observation mechanism, since swept last year Fra called for this. Some may deny evidence, we cannot continue as Apr4 attack did not take place. We cannot pretend this chaos and devastation is not Assads fault. Pol solution is more urgent than ever. As long as this regime is in power bc of complicity of those propping it up, there will never be peace in Sryia. Refugges have no hope of returning home and we will never have oppo to tackle terrorists. Pressure to bear on stakeholders so they can engage in good faith in negotiations.

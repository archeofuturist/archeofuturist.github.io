His most famous experiment, the mouse universe, was created in July 1968. Four pairs of mice were introduced into the habitat. The habitat was a 9-footsquare metal pen. There was no shortage of food or water or nesting material. There were no predators. The only adversity was the limit on space.<br><br>Initially, the population grew rapidly, doubling every 55 days. The period between day 315 and day 600 saw a breakdown in social structure and in normal social behavior. Among the aberrations in behavior were the following: expulsion of young before weaning was complete, wounding of young, increase in homosexual behavior, inability of dominant males to maintain the defense of their territory, aggressive behavior of females, and extreme passivity of non-dominant males.<br><br>After day 600, the social breakdown continued and the population declined toward extinction. During this period females ceased to reproduce. Their male counterparts withdrew completely, never engaging in courtship or fighting. They ate, drank, slept, and groomed themselves \u2013 all solitary pursuits. Sleek, healthy coats and an absence of scars characterized these males. They were dubbed &quot;the beautiful ones.&quot; Breeding never resumed and behavior patterns were permanently changed and the mouse population slowly died out.<br><br>https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/John_<wbr>B._Calhoun<br><br>g-g-guys...

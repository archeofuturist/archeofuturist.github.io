They also tend to make decisions based on emotion, rather than on rational thinking, way more than Asians.In the course of history there have been various cases where whites dealt with their problems in a way that was \u201cdecent\u201d instead of in the way that was the most effective.<br>Examples of this are:<br>\u2022 In Australia, they wanted to get rid of the aborigines. They could have easily exterminated them, instead they chose to separate abbo children from their people and let them breed with whites over and over until their genes were \u201cerased\u201d.<br>\u2022 In America, they abolished slavery and then instead of sending the slaves back to Africa or exterminating them, the simply freed them.<br>\u2022 Americans gave the Indians reservations, instead of just chasing them away or exterminating them.<br>\u2022 Hitler (arguably) let the English escape at Dunkirk. He also (allegedly) expelled the Jews first instead of just exterminating them from the beginning. <br>This \u201cempathy\u201d might have come from the fact that Europeans used to hunt using animals like wolfs\/dogs and developed agriculture (using animals) earlier than most other races. Therefore the tribes that were more empathetic towards their animals, kept them in better condition and would consequently have more food. So empathy became an instinct for Europeans.<br>I believe \u201cempathy\u201d is a fundamental flaw of the white race and will cause its ultimate demise. White people are a living example of the saying &quot;No good deed goes unpunished&quot;.<br><br>Source: <br>https:\/\/heartiste.wordpress.com\/201<wbr>5\/07\/01\/dangerous-science-clues-tha<wbr>t-empathic-ability-varies-by-race\/<br><br>Previous thread: <a href=\"\/pol\/thread\/117509306#p117509306\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;117509306<\/a>","filename":"2008_Jared_Taylor","ext":".jpg","w":220,"h":254,"tn_w":216,"tn_h":250,"tim":1490293120161,"time":1490293120,"md5":"lLKTgSqfZ483mWr9x8BB2A==","fsize":15394,"resto":0,"id":"zU1zGN5L","country":"BE","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"the-white-mans-empathy","country_name":"Belgium","replies":40,"images":10,"omitted_posts":35,"omitted_images":10},{"no":117972397,"now":"03\/23\/17(Thu)15:38:00","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p117968850\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;117968850<\/a><br><br>there have never been more than 3000 belgians in the free state. negroes were more than happy to abuse their tribesmen on the white man&#039;s behalf.<br><br>and you ignore the widespread &quot;white&quot; protests against the atrocities in the congo.","filename":"quote-i-do-not-want-to-miss-a-good-chance-of-getting-us-a-slice-of-this-magnificent-african-cake-leopold-ii-of-belgium-246842","ext":".jpg","w":850,"h":400,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":58,"tim":1490297880041,"time":1490297880,"md5":"cCNg+LZijo6SmhmNlS11sg==","fsize":60794,"resto":117962688,"id":"hdoN\/kDZ","country":"BE","country_name":"Belgium"},{"no":117972403,"now":"03\/23\/17(Thu)15:38:05","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p117971919\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;117971919<\/a><br><br>I&#039;d also like to add that as we see more anti-white rhetoric and whites start understanding that the rest of the world groups them together instead of judging individually, we will of course move back towards a new collectivist attitude. <br><br>You already see it with Trumpism and Gen Z.

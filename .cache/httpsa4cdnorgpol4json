This election is one of the most important elections of Europe as the Sweden Democrats (Sverigedemokraterna), a civic-nationalist party rather similar to French Front National, is expected to become either the largest, or at least the second largest, party. <br><br>Since the refugee crisis last fall and the consequent deterioration of both our government services and of the social order, the indigenous middle- and working class is getting increasingly fed up with the total failure of multiculturalism. Many are slowly beginning to realize that the only way forward is a complete and total shutdown of immigration (i.e. some kind of moratorium) and a successive repatriation-policy of an absolute majority of those who have come the last three decades or so. <br><br>Even a number of high-ranking social-democrats as well as communists have come to the conclusion that drastic measures such as these have to be taken to avoid a future scenario in which the extensive Swedish welfare state can no longer sustain itself and the subsequent social, economic and ethnic conflicts this would give rise to (although they do not dare say this publically yet). <br><br>Having witnessed the success of the Trump-campaign through memetic memes, many Swedish patriots would like to see this strategy tried in Sweden as a last resort to try and help our poor deluded people save it from its own self-harming delusions. <br><br>I would thus humbly ask you to help us prepare for the next meme war.<br><br><br>I would ask you to do this for the girl who no longer feels safe walking outdoors at night, for the retired worked whose care-home can no longer afford him coffee, for the ordinary guy who feels like a stranger in his own country and for the Swedish men and women who love their country and their people and do not wish to see their identity erased for ever.","filename":"Its deportation time","ext":".jpg","w":356,"h":438,"tn_w":203,"tn_h":250,"tim":1490146132165,"time":1490146132,"md5":"kx9O82EvTQeW5yy6PjV34g==","fsize":47402,"resto":0,"id":"IblU2QZS","country":"SE","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"help-us-meme-nationalists-into-power-in-the","country_name":"Sweden","replies":0,"images":0}]},{"posts":[{"no":117700046,"now":"03\/21\/17(Tue)21:25:50","name":"Anonymous","com":"Should \/pol\/ and the majority of other white people be forced to undergo mandatory magnet therapy?<br><br>http:\/\/www.independent.co.uk\/news\/s<wbr>cience\/archaeology\/news\/brain-magne<wbr>ts-decrease-faith-in-god-religion-i<wbr>mmigrants-a6695291.html#commentsDiv<wbr>","filename":"1489955286089","ext":".jpg","w":984,"h":960,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":243,"tim":1490145950760,"time":1490145950,"md5":"5tw2oHe0N+dYVi\/qmq+++w==","fsize":191210,"resto":0,"id":"ZXcKuf+O","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"should-pol-and-the-majority-of-other-white-people","country_name":"United States","replies":5,"images":0},{"no":117700126,"now":"03\/21\/17(Tue)21:26:32","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p117700046\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;117700046<\/a><br>Only a BBC could satisfy that ass","time":1490145992,"resto":117700046,"id":"A+IPqOrN","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":117700204,"now":"03\/21\/17(Tue)21:27:10","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p117700046\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;117700046<\/a><br>*BRAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAP*","time":1490146030,"resto":117700046,"id":"61SD+kzd","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":117700236,"now":"03\/21\/17(Tue)21:27:27","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p117700126\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;117700126<\/a><br>thanks for the input ahmed","time":1490146047,"resto":117700046,"id":"ZKGsSEjQ","country":"NZ","country_name":"New Zealand"},{"no":117700263,"now":"03\/21\/17(Tue)21:27:41","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p117700126\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;117700126<\/a><br>flag checks out","time":1490146061,"resto":117700046,"id":"Qz8PxNbx","country":"CL","country_name":"Chile"},{"no":117700374,"now":"03\/21\/17(Tue)21:28:50","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p117700046\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;117700046<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Should \/pol\/ and the majority of other white people be forced to undergo mandatory magnet therapy?<\/span><br>If you&#039;re a cuckold for authoritarian states then sure.

I understand inflation but something about the whole system doesn&#039;t add up. I can live in 1950s America, put in 1 hour of labor to make 1 dollar and buy 5 gallons of gasoline with that 1 dollar right away. But if I hold on to that dollar, wait until 2000s, I can barely buy 1\/3 of a gallon of gasoline.<br><br>Now, I understand that there are factors to attend here, namely that gasoline is a limited resource and there may be a much higher supply\/demand in the 1950s, but what if we take something that should cost less over time, say clothing? If I lived in the 1700s, before the invention of the cotton gin, grew my own cotton, made a sweater out of it, I make a nice little profit. I could buy back that sweater right away. I should, in theory, hold on to my money, wait until there are more efficient ways to make clothing (due to technology - cotton gins, farming equipment, etc), and then use that spending power to buy 100 sweaters. But I can&#039;t. The purchasing power is still LESS! I think about what money is... it&#039;s supposed to be a means of trading wealth and value. We use fiat currency instead of a bartering system so that we can (1) efficiently trade one labor for another (it&#039;s more efficient to leave the farmers do the farming and for me to do whatever it is I specialize in), and (2) so we can hold onto this spending power so we can cash in the fruits of our labor at a later time. But the system we have breaks (2). <br><br>Where does this spending power go? Help!<br><br>My theory is that money is being printed into the system that devalues the money I won. Naturally, if I have $100 in a system that has $1m in circulation, and the gov&#039;t prints $10m, then my spending power goes down to almost a tenth of what it once was.

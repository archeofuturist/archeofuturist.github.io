Choi\u2019s father, Choi Tae-min, had developed a close bond with the President after her mother\u2019s death. A Wikileaks diplomatic cable from 2007 referred to rumors among the South Korean public that Tae-min was a \u201cRasputin\u201d type figure with \u201ccomplete control over Park\u2019s body and soul during her formative years.\u201d The New York Times reported in 2016 that Mr. Choi was the founder of an obscure sect based on Buddhism, Christianity and Chondogyo called the Church of Eternal Life who befriended Ms. Park, 40 years his junior, soon after her mother was assassinated in 1974.

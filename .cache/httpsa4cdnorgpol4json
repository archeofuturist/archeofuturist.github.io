That\u2019s not what I\u2019m getting at. I only want to say that it is hard to believe Sledgehammer Games when they say they want to tell a \u201cdiverse\u201d and \u201cglobal\u201d story (and this is what they really said). Because they have once again put you into the combat boots of a United States private. Nothing invites tunnel vision like exploring a complicated, vicious and worldwide conflict via the iron sights of a US infantry man. We\u2019re told that there will be a playable moment with a woman in the French Resistance, along with others, but how brief, long, or significant those moments are, we do not know. It wasn\u2019t mentioned in the trailer, and the three actors brought on stage during Activision\u2019s presentation were all men playing the main roles of the US soldier boys. They then spoke about how the bonds made in the recording studio were reflective of the bonds between soldiers fighting in a deadly and chaotic environment.

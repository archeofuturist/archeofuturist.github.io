You experience the same cravings a fat person feels when they eat a salad. It&#039;s funny that you&#039;re trying to hand-wave the food addiction thing away when the same man who argues that porn addiction is real also believes that food addiction is real on exactly the same basis. But you&#039;d look like a fool on \/pol\/ if you sympathised with fat people, so you just pick and choose what you want to believe instead. Also, if you want to go down that road, lack of ejaculation and sexual activity may not kill you outright, but studies have shown time and time again that it has an impact on your health, and even decreases longevity. Like, say, low-grade sleep deprivation, or malnutrition.<br><br>Every time you mention the word &quot;dopamine&quot;, I sort of cringe inwardly, because it signals your lack of education. You keep mentioning it as if it&#039;s the be-all-and-end-all of addiction, when the neurochemistry behind addiction is much more complicated and dopamine only plays one small role. It&#039;s like you&#039;re trying to give your argument some sort of authority by name-dropping the only neurotransmitter you know about, without realising how simple it makes you look. You talk about degree and severity as if you&#039;ve a knowledge of all the different factors that might enter into addiction, but did you ever stop to consider that people with developmental disorders like ADHD, for example, are much more likely to tick the criteria for masturbation &quot;addiction&quot; than the average person? And that is just one of many things impacted by impairment to executive function, instead of an actual addiction? The point being that there are a myriad alternative explanations for what Gary Wilson dupes suckers into believing is addiction that you have never even thought about. But, by all means, keep memeing people into believing they have an addiction based on your own half-assed research into the subject.","time":1490526600,"resto":118336826,"id":"8QOXYkHD","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":118351147,"now":"03\/26\/17(Sun)07:12:56","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118348744\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118348744<\/a><br>get czechfu","filename":"1489657580487","ext":".gif","w":317,"h":549,"tn_w":72,"tn_h":125,"tim":1490526776002,"time":1490526776,"md5":"TBCvEZ0+YIl53R3p83XXvw==","fsize":2047890,"resto":118336826,"id":"iAXbsQZ\/","country":"NZ","country_name":"New Zealand"}]},{"posts":[{"no":118350051,"now":"03\/26\/17(Sun)06:58:27","name":"Anonymous","sub":"Holy shit \/pol\/ was right","filename":"woah","ext":".png","w":892,"h":725,"tn_w":249,"tn_h":203,"tim":1490525907641,"time":1490525907,"md5":"qXeaGs2yaAW0zIUlKAxQug==","fsize":183992,"resto":0,"id":"4cSfplHW","country":"GB","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"holy-shit-pol-was-right","country_name":"United Kingdom","replies":5,"images":0},{"no":118350287,"now":"03\/26\/17(Sun)07:01:44","name":"Anonymous","com":"What","time":1490526104,"resto":118350051,"id":"teRbxO\/4","country":"SI","country_name":"Slovenia"},{"no":118350358,"now":"03\/26\/17(Sun)07:02:42","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118350051\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118350051<\/a><br>I thought that this wasn&#039;t in English first","time":1490526162,"resto":118350051,"id":"Ta\/dUPbS","country":"HU","country_name":"Hungary"},{"no":118350513,"now":"03\/26\/17(Sun)07:04:41","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118350358\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118350358<\/a><br>It isn&#039;t in English.","time":1490526281,"resto":118350051,"id":"IFWck2nG","country":"BG","country_name":"Bulgaria"},{"no":118350564,"now":"03\/26\/17(Sun)07:05:17","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118350287\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118350287<\/a><br>The guy replying is a chosen one","time":1490526317,"resto":118350051,"id":"Zupzrx8E","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":118351146,"now":"03\/26\/17(Sun)07:12:55","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118350513\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118350513<\/a><br>Yeah it&#039;s kinda is<br>pree: look<br>oynbo: white<br>jollof: name of the food","time":1490526775,"resto":118350051,"id":"Ta\/dUPbS","country":"HU","country_name":"Hungary"}]},{"posts":[{"no":118344077,"now":"03\/26\/17(Sun)05:36:06","name":"Anonymous","com":"Why is it that only white guys turn into nu males?

You can&#039;t start a dialogue. You won&#039;t. But, apart from that, antifascism is an everyday-practice to avoid the same mistake Italy and Germany did some seventy years ago. I&#039;m not antifascist to have some physical fights, I don&#039;t even like it. I&#039;m antifascist to prevent the spreading of racism, sexism (I&#039;m not, and will never be a feminist, which is for me a form of sexism itself), supremacy, chauvinism, classism, close-minded thoughts on and nationalization and warfare.<br><br>Also, some confuse antifascists with anarchists.

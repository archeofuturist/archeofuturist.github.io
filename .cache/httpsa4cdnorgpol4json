It was not Gautama\u2019s intention to attempt to destroy all effort, desire, and affection in the escape from suffering; rather was his teaching designed to picture to mortal man the futility of pinning all hope and aspirations entirely on temporal goals and material objectives. It was not so much that love of one\u2019s fellows should be shunned as that the true believer should also look beyond the associations of this material world to the realities of the eternal future.","time":1490764058,"resto":118732380,"id":"GfKKBmky","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":118750431,"now":"03\/29\/17(Wed)01:09:34","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118750027\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118750027<\/a><br>pizza AND kids<br>kek","time":1490764174,"resto":118732380,"id":"piy+KUy4","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":118750486,"now":"03\/29\/17(Wed)01:10:15","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118750283\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118750283<\/a><br>Yeeeeeeeah, I&#039;m not really a big-B Buddhist kinda guy.

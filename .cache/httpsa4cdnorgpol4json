A survey conducted for the report determined 39.4 percent of girls in juvenile corrections facilities identify as LGB, with an additional 18.5 percent identifying as \u201cmostly straight,\u201d compared to just 3.2 percent of boys who identify as gay or bisexual, with an additional 3.9 percent who self-identify as \u201cmostly straight.\u201d Boys make up a much higher percentage of incarcerated youths. In total, the study found 6.5 percent of all youth in custody identify as LGB, and the number jumps to 11.8 percent when those who describe themselves as \u201cmostly straight\u201d get added to that group.<br><br>A recent study by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention suggests nearly 12 of high school girls are lesbian, gay or bisexual compared to 4.5 percent of boys.<br><br>And while in custody, LGB youth are more likely to be sexually victimized. \u201cReports of sexual victimization by staff were lower for girls than boys and varied from 2.2 percent for straight girls to 15.1 percent for gay\/bisexual boys. Youth-perpetrated sexual assaults and injury were the most commonly victimization experienced across all population subgroups.

Or they retire them entirely and increase output from the neighboring nuclear, hydro, natural gas, whatever. Hardly anyone rebuilds coal plants anymore.<br><br>So who&#039;s gonna buy the coal? How can you save something nobody wants? Natural gas is cheap, requires a smaller plant to produce power, and is easier to transport because you get more energy per square inch.<br><br>Coal is dead.

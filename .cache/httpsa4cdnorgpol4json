The (((US government))) uses them to sell a story for whatever it takes to get the public to mentally sign off on &quot;regime chance&quot; and in return defectors get asylum and treated like dignitaries. Defectors made statements claiming Saddam had stockpiles of ready-to-go WMDs. Some of you are too young to remember that but some of you will remember. Defectors aided Bush, Rumsfeld, Cheney, Powell, and the cabal who said confidently that Saddam had mobile weapons laboratories (WMDs in trucks) to evade detection. Flash forward. Years post war, Saddam was only discovered to have old legacy of lesser chemical weapons there were by no means a serious threat to the US by his regime. (((Ironically))), after his overthrow and ISIS capturing parts of Iraq, those weapons are now a serious threat in the hands of jihadists in Syria.<br><br>Later in 2003, the US kept claiming they found these mobile labs. That was a lie. They kept lying about it and right as the lies were starting to catch up to them they invaded Iraq.

They <br><br>Retarded motherfuckers who think the (((US government))) cared about chemical weapons and Saddam&#039;s &quot;brutality on his people&quot; are useful idiots who don&#039;t understand that the US propped up and sold Saddam many of those weapons.

The use of cannabis to induce trance and divination by soothsayers was a characteristic of the Scythian belief system..<br><br>The term Arya is used in ancient Persian texts, for example in the behistun inscription from the 5th century BCE, in which the Persian kings Darius the Great and Xerxes are described as &quot;Aryans of Aryan stock&quot; (arya arya chi\u00e7a). The inscription also refers to the deity Ahura Mazda as &quot;the god of the Aryans&quot;, and to the ancient Persian language as &quot;Aryan&quot;. In this sense the word seems to have referred to the elite culture of the ancient Iranians, including both linguistic, cultural and religious aspects.

Although my horror stories are nowhere near as bad as some of the shit I&#039;ve seen shared here, I have no problem believing any of it, being that I dealt with very similar problems.<br><br>I did a year at Bradley Tech, which is supposed to be like a prep school for MIT, and we had some very bright students, even a few black ones, but it was on the whole a containment facility for some of the vilest nigger animals I&#039;ve ever personally encountered. The last straw for me was a police raid where four (4) firearms were recovered from student lockers.<br><br>So I transferred to Town of Lake, which had just been renamed Ronald Reagan High, rather appropriately, taking into account how many illegal Mexicans were enrolled. Thought they do function somewhat better than negro students, it was bloody murder keeping their attention and maintaining order.<br><br>The little spic brat who drove me out of the school and the profession would come into my classes (he wasn&#039;t actually one of my students) to pester a young blonde girl into dating him. Every time I&#039;d tell him to leave and not return, he&#039;d get into my personal space, so close I could smell his Bud Light Lime shitbreath, and dare me to put my hands on him, then threaten me with his family members, whom he claimed, probably honestly, were high-ranking members of various spic street gangs, primarily the Latin Kings.<br><br>The administration wouldn&#039;t do anything about him, and he knew it, so to rub it in, he fucked up my car, a brand-new VW Passat. Not the greatest car, sure, but the first new one I&#039;d ever bought, and I liked it, and felt I&#039;d earned it, having kept up my end of the bargain with MPS to try to train their monkey-ass negroid animals to at least pretend they were learning.

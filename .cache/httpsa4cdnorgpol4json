Bush tax cuts, war on terrorism, and financial crisis caused by deregulating the banks caused the debt to skyrocket. Both Obama and Clinton increased tax revenue and decreased spending. Clinton left office with a budget surplus. You voted for a Russian-compromised narcissist whose platform is unambiguously going to increase the budget deficit and overall debt.

Today, we will be reading:<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Women\u2019s Studies as Virus: Institutional Feminism and the Projection of Danger<\/span><br><br>which is a FEMINIST (as in: written by feminists) paper whose purpose is to draw an analogy between the behavior of a virus and that of feminism as a movement. I will not be doing much in this thread as I will be reading the text for the first time. I will merely copy paste the text and perhaps comment it. I will not copy the whole of the text however, but only those section which I find most relevant. Without further ado, here is the abstract.<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Because women\u2019s studies radically challenges social hierarchies and lacks a unified identity and canon of thought, it often negotiates a precarious position within the modern corporatized university. At the same time, women\u2019s studies offers\u2014by virtue of its interdisciplinary, critical, and \u201cinfectious\u201d structure\u2014cutting-edge perspectives and goals that set it apart from more traditional fields. This paper theorizes that one future pedagogical priority of women\u2019s studies is to train students not only to master a body of knowledge but also to serve as symbolic \u201cviruses\u201d that infect, unsettle, and disrupt traditional and entrenched fields. In this essay, we first posit how the metaphor of the virus in part exemplifies an ideal feminist pedagogy, and we then investigate how both women\u2019s studies and the spread of actual viruses (e.g., Ebola, HIV) produce similar kinds of emotional responses in others.<\/span><br><br>link: http:\/\/hipatiapress.com\/hpjournals\/<wbr>index.php\/generos\/article\/viewFile\/<wbr>1983\/1624#page=78","filename":"how to read a book","ext":".jpg","w":200,"h":310,"tn_w":161,"tn_h":249,"tim":1490353913541,"time":1490353913,"md5":"SLhITUBgGLH\/A8II4FNSgw==","fsize":20155,"resto":0,"id":"yAqxPYcA","country":"CA","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"pol-reads-something-feminist-parasites-edition","country_name":"Canada","replies":33,"images":0,"omitted_posts":28,"omitted_images":0},{"no":118075096,"now":"03\/24\/17(Fri)08:22:12","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118074368\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118074368<\/a><br>Its a lot to read through anon, and its pretty dry stuff but its definitely worthwhile. \/pol\/ moves so fast these days that things like this tend to get lost","time":1490358132,"resto":118070243,"id":"KDfg+Z\/8","country":"AU","country_name":"Australia"},{"no":118075297,"now":"03\/24\/17(Fri)08:24:48","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118075096\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118075096<\/a><br>I wish \/pol\/ had a more serious wing.

Teenager I stopped eating meat. I felt kind of sick after eating it and biting on chunks of fat made me gag and my stomach turn. For about 5 years I went full vegetarian. Even smelling meat was hard and disgusting. <br><br>It changed when I was invited to a celebration feast for a completed apprenticeship. We&#039;ve been about 20 guys an a big table with pretty much anything from salat to fish to meat and bread, in a nice restaurant. <br><br>Of course I started with salat and vegetables, but everything was so awsome and tasty, more tasty than anything I&#039;ve eaten before in my life. I enjoyed it so much, I had to try everything on the table including the various meat dishes. Not only it was so good I felt like crying, only a few minutes later a unique satisfying wave of warmth filled every cell in my body. Only then I understood my body desired this for a very long time and I selfishly denied it. Nothing can compare to giving your body what it truly wants and needs.<br><br>Days after that meal I felt like a changed person. I could think better and was full of energy. My face had a healthy color and smelled better. <br><br>No matter what anyone says, you cannot replace meat in your diet. Soja Product and various other Products to get the Proteins? It&#039;s all a lie.<br><br>Don&#039;t buy cheap shit from a discouter. Nothing can compare to quality meat and a cook who knows what he&#039;s doing. Never looked back to the vegetarian life, I only regret beeing so dumb for many years and miss out on good food.<br><br>Also, many politically correct people seem to be vegetarians and vegans thus making eating meat politically incorrect for some reason.

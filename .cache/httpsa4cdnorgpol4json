When any of their publications are outlawed and labeled \u201cextremist\u201d, Jehovah\u2019s Witnesses comply with the law and remove it from their places of worship and homes.

This will effectively allow Russia to take over all of the Jehovah\u2019s Witnesses\u2019 legally registered and established places of worship throughout the country affecting over 100,000 of their citizens. In doing so Russia would be able to criminally prosecute any members of the faith.

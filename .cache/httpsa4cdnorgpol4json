Having just had my grandmother cremated last year, I would also wonder about the time necessary, even when split into machine-hours.<br><br>I am told by jewishvirtuallibrary.org and nizkor.org that the Crematorium II (&quot;Krema II&quot;) facility at Aushwitz-Birkenau contained 15 &quot;muffles&quot; (receptacle for the corpse). And that in December of 1943, using a strategy of alternating loads of 3 and then 2 bodies into each muffle, this coke-fired crematory was capable of turning 2,250 bodies into complete ash every 24 hours, allowing 4 hours of downtime. <br><br>2,250? Are they aware that stuffing more material in doesn&#039;t actually reduce the energy requirements? If we were to assume an average body weight of 50kg, we&#039;re talking about reducing 112,500kg of biomass into dust in 18 hours? A body is about 65% water weight, so that would give us 73,125kg -- it takes about 2.5 MJ (megajoules) of energy to evaporate 1kg of water. <br><br>So every 18 hours, these receptacles are given 182,813 MJ of energy, from a coke-fired furnace? This is just for the water.

Many of the rural areas surrounding it have dial up, satellite, or no internet at all. Chattanooga wants to expand its network so these rural areas can have the same Gbps and 10 Gpbs connections the city has. Rather than allow that to happen, Tennessee&#039;s legislature just voted to give Comcast and AT&amp;T a $45 million taxpayer handout.<br>This year, the Tennessee state legislature was finally considering a bill that would have let EPB expand its coverage (without providing it any special tax breaks or grants; EPB is profitable and doesn&#039;t rely on taxpayer money). Rather than pass that bill, Tennessee has just passed the &quot;Broadband Accessibility Act of 2017,&quot; which gives private telecom companies\u2014in this case, probably AT&amp;T and Comcast\u2014$45 million of taxpayer money over the next three years to build internet infrastructure to rural areas.<br><br>To be clear: EPB wanted to build out its gigabit fiber network to many of these same communities using money it has on hand or private loans at no cost to taxpayers. It would then charge individual residents for internet service. Instead, Tennessee taxpayers will give $45 million in tax breaks and grants to giant companies just to get basic infrastructure built.

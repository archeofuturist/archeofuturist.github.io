Most people I&#039;ve known who went through it really didn&#039;t plan it out well, started too late, or had unrealistic expectations. Take this with a grain of salt, though, because women in this current state of western civilization are almost all degenerates.

And I&#039;m going to be honest \/pol\/, it&#039;s a rare thing to ever meet anyone who isn&#039;t a fucking propaganda spouting degenerate these days, male, female or otherwise.

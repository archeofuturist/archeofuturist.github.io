They also tend to make decisions based on emotion, rather than on rational thinking, way more than Asians.In the course of history there have been various cases where whites dealt with their problems in a way that was \u201cdecent\u201d instead of in the way that was the most effective.<br>Examples of this are:<br>\u2022 In Australia, they wanted to get rid of the aborigines. They could have easily exterminated them, instead they chose to separate abbo children from their people and let them breed with whites over and over until their genes were \u201cerased\u201d.<br>\u2022 In America, they abolished slavery and then instead of sending the slaves back to Africa or exterminating them, the simply freed them.<br>\u2022 Americans gave the Indians reservations, instead of just chasing them away or exterminating them.<br>\u2022 Hitler (arguably) let the English escape at Dunkirk. He also (allegedly) expelled the Jews first instead of just exterminating them from the beginning. <br>This \u201cempathy\u201d might have come from the fact that Europeans used to hunt using animals like wolfs\/dogs and developed agriculture (using animals) earlier than most other races. Therefore the tribes that were more empathetic towards their animals, kept them in better condition and would consequently have more food. So empathy became an instinct for Europeans.<br>I believe \u201cempathy\u201d is a fundamental flaw of the white race and will cause its ultimate demise.

It&#039;s like in nature sometimes potent viruses etc develop. That&#039;s what this is. A very specific strain of thought\/ an ethos (think of it as memes) that started spreading originally with the utopian socialist in France and then the rest is history (Central Europe and Eastern Europe, eventually Western Europe, and lastly the US). You get moral relativism, nihilism, Marxism, and eventually what leads to modern &quot;Critical Theory.&quot; <br><br>The virus&#039; major pathology is to infect the intelligentsias of nations (academia, media, etc.) with their radical instruments who use that platform to infect the masses. They do it first with academic fashion and then use administrative force to maintain power. Go read some shit from the &quot;People&#039;s Movement&quot; in early revolutionary Russia. They are open about their strategy of propagandizing students to then go propagandize the freed serfs etc. They don&#039;t hide it in their memoirs. <br><br>On the other side of things, Hayek has a great paper detailing the top down influence of socialism called &quot;The Intellectuals and Socialism.&quot; (Give it a read it&#039;s short.) in my opinion you are dealing with a strain of meme-virus that spreads with a very very potent combination of propaganda networks, emotional appeals, over-consumerism, jealousy-based politics, etc. I think it would do is well to focus on rooting out that virus instead of making it out to be some sort of inevitable force.

That conclusion is that we really fucking need Christianity. I&#039;m actually an atheist, but I&#039;ve thought quite a while on this, and this is the conclusion I&#039;ve come to. Everything is shitty in the way it is right now thanks to religion going out of style. As much as the bible is filled with authoritarian bullshit...some of that bullshit is highly potent truth about maintaining society. It is entirely possible to live without a bible to guide you and still have strong morals and understanding of values in society, however it is not a given. I think many attempting to think freely reach this state...they think a little bit about religion, and realize 1) theres some bullshit, and 2) some of it is restrictive. The automatic reaction is to fully reject religion. Unfortunately it seems most stop there, they don&#039;t continue to contemplate about the idea of God, or the point of humanities existence etc etc.<br>This, combined with innate instinctual desire to see humanity succeed, creates your typical liberal atheist: A person who doesn&#039;t give the slightest fuck about religion, and likely a loose understanding of morals.<br><br>Given all I&#039;ve learned about religion and Christianity...I&#039;ve concluded we desperately need religion, and Christianity is the absolute best one, most likely to be the most successful and lead to the best most civilized world.

That means Hitler killed roughly 1 Jew every 30 seconds. (LOL)<br><br>In Auschwitz, the most famous and biggest concentration camp, there are 15 crematoriums. According to Auschwitz survivors, Jews would go into the chamber, gassed for 15-20 minutes, then put into the oven.<br><br>It takes 1 hour to cremate a body using modern furnaces which operate at much higher temperatures than the traditional ovens at the camp. However, lets say that the ovens were operating at a level that we see today, that means it would take 1 hour, 20 minutes to gas and burn 15 Jews assuming they were all burned simultaneously. (Disregarding the time it would take for the gas to empty the chamber for the bodies to be transported from the chamber to the oven.) The elevators used to transport bodies were very slow and could only take up 7 bodies at a time with their weight capacity. However, for our greatest ally, we&#039;re going to assume that bodies were teleported instantly from chamber to oven.<br><br>That means 15 Jews were gassed and burned every 1.2 hours. That comes out to exactly 300 Jews every 24 hours (Assuming the gassing and burning of Jews was happening every hour straight for 6 years on an uninterrupted basis) the total number of jews killed would be 657,000 for those 6 years. The official Jewish story is that 4,000,000 Jews were killed at Auschwitz alone.<br><br>How can any Jew, Israeli, or Shill ever even argue this story when just simple math is enough to destroy the whole argument? Can any Jews respond to this?","filename":"1484017748907m","ext":".jpg","w":793,"h":1024,"tn_w":96,"tn_h":125,"tim":1492129925572,"time":1492129925,"md5":"N9gHo40xiVIkGnKpHFvkWA==","fsize":205341,"resto":120988423,"id":"RlwUkMN0","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":120990097,"now":"04\/13\/17(Thu)20:33:18","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120989930\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120989930<\/a><br>This is a bad argument that makes Holocaust skeptics look stupid","time":1492129998,"resto":120988423,"id":"KozX08lm","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":120991443,"now":"04\/13\/17(Thu)20:43:41","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120990097\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120990097<\/a><br>It&#039;s not a bad argument at all. They obviously weren&#039;t gassed since it would be mathematically impossible to do so. They likely weren&#039;t shot because if that were the case, then where are all of the graves? There should be mass graves containing millions of people buried around the camps. At Aushwitz alone the area required to bury approx 3.3 million Jews (That&#039;s minus the more than 657K who were supposedly gassed and cremated) would be roughly 13.5 million feet^3 or a length of 5.9K miles if buried head to foot. <br><br>Also, how long would it take to dig holes large enough for thousands of groups of people? Where do you put the displaced soil? How many holes holding, say, 300 each would it take to fit 6 million? Assuming it&#039;s true, mass graves should be everywhere.

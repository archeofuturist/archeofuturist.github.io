Normies, in this moment, are not going to be cool with ethnocentrism. They&#039;re not going to be cool with all the things you want to have because they&#039;ve been conditioned to hate those things. To do these things they hate will make them hate you. However, that&#039;s just how they are now. People change when they see they&#039;ve been wrong on some things. The goal is to find these extents of their patience and test them. That&#039;s what Trump did.<br><br>This game isn&#039;t over, so stop shooting for endgame goals. Shoot for milestones. They&#039;re a lot like you, yes, they&#039;ve just been taught to hate you, and being exactly what they hate isn&#039;t doing anyone favors.","filename":"1478852529311","ext":".gif","w":400,"h":400,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":250,"tim":1493767758984,"time":1493767758,"md5":"QuxZeP8vuEOrPmkQbD79cg==","fsize":3582184,"resto":0,"id":"AVIPfnpw","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"a-friendly-reminder-for-politically-active","country_name":"United States","replies":13,"images":2,"omitted_posts":8,"omitted_images":0},{"no":123840587,"now":"05\/02\/17(Tue)19:57:41","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123837327\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123837327<\/a><br>So what if they hate us?

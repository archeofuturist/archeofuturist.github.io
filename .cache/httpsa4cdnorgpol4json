The image of early Christians that they generally have is essentially that the early Christians were pretty much like 20th Century Evangelicals or Charismatics! That the First Century Christians would have had liturgical worship, or would have adhered to any tradition is inconceivable \u2014 only later, &quot;when the Church became corrupted,&quot; is it imagined that such things entered the Church. It comes as quite a blow to such Protestants (as it did to me) when they actually study the early Church and the writings of the early Fathers and begin to see a distinctly different picture than that which they were always led to envision.&quot;<br><br>&quot;...In the second place, if Paul meant to exclude tradition as not also being profitable, then we should wonder why Paul uses non-biblical oral tradition in this very same chapter. The names Jannes and Jambres are not found in the Old Testament, yet in II Timothy 3:8 Paul refers to them as opposing Moses. Paul is drawing upon the oral tradition that the names of the two most prominent Egyptian Magicians in the Exodus account (Ch. 7-8) were &quot;Jannes&quot; and &quot;Jambres.&quot;2 And this is by no means the only time that a non-biblical source is used in the New Testament \u2014 the best known instance is in the Epistle of St. Jude, which quotes from the Book of Enoch (Jude 14,15 cf. Enoch 1:9).&quot;<br><br>http:\/\/orthodoxinfo.com\/inquirers\/t<wbr>ca_solascriptura.aspx<br><br>Take the Scriptural Red Pill, \/pol\/","filename":"Christ","ext":".jpg","w":162,"h":310,"tn_w":130,"tn_h":249,"tim":1491019732773,"time":1491019732,"md5":"9S+S2NdGFbcwt5Yy1qTDnw==","fsize":11506,"resto":0,"id":"W3uMPKFG","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"sola-scriptura","trip":"!!gPgnNJshfxt","country_name":"United States","replies":19,"images":6,"omitted_posts":14,"omitted_images":3},{"no":119146379,"now":"04\/01\/17(Sat)00:54:29","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119145937\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119145937<\/a><br>What literature would you recommend besides the new testament?

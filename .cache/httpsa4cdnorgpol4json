You never figured out how to live in a society bigger than one or two squabbling families. Starting thousands of years ago, everyone else on this planet without exception did - they invented religion, the idea of law, and the ideas of property and respect for the value of human life. This enabled tribes to coalesce into bigger groups and become organized. The rest is history, or rather civilization. But your lot never did this, did they? Abstract thought and problem- solving have never been the black man&#039;s strengths, have they? Did they invent a long-lived and intellectually coherent religion? Nope. Did they ever build a city? Nope. Did they even invent bricks? Nope (the reason there&#039;s no Stonehenge in Africa is because it took more than 20 people to move the slabs of rock - clearly a non-starter in Africa, where assembling more than 20 niggers normally results in a war). Did they till the land? Nope. Did they domesticate an animal for their use? Nope. Did they invent a written language? Nope. Did they invent the wheel? Mainly, nope. Were they curious enough about what lay out across the sea to sail upon it? Nope. And blacks are the only &quot;humans&quot; on this planet of which all this is true. Eskimos are more technically advanced than blacks were, despite the handicap of having no raw materials to work with other than dead fish and snow. Indians managed to domesticate the elephant. Why couldn&#039;t niggers? So why do you fail everywhere even today? Let me offer you jigaboos a hypothesis. It&#039;s because feral behavior - innate savagery, murderous violence if annoyed, predisposition to rape many women and thus fecklessly father many children - conferred valuable survival advantages on individuals","filename":"1490612245385","ext":".gif","w":400,"h":222,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":138,"tim":1491046978072,"time":1491046978,"md5":"reSq6l49dK81enp98rQw7Q==","fsize":1450070,"resto":0,"id":"eBz5MtjV","country":"DE","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"face-the-facts-niggers-your-race-are-a-failed","country_name":"Germany","replies":233,"images":85,"omitted_posts":228,"omitted_images":85,"tail_size":50},{"no":119222386,"now":"04\/02\/17(Sun)13:36:50","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119221963\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119221963<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Herodotus is sort of famous for fabricating shit.<\/span><br>It would be more accurate to say Herodotus took everyone for their word and wrote down everything people said.

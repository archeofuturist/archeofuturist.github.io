To mix things a bit up I decided to make an FAQ about Islam<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Why Islam?<\/span><br>Islam is truth. Christianity though initially having been based on a revelation by God has been thoroughly disproven. The bible is completely unreliable with the originals still unknown to this day. The quran however has been perfectly preserved since the beginning.<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Are Islam&#039;s teachings and \/pol\/&#039;s views compatible?<\/span><br>Yes perfectly. Islam fights any form of degeneracy with an iron fist. No drugs, no alcohol, no feminism. Strong patriarchic family values. The sound of children&#039;s laughter has almost silenced in the west, Islam has the highest birthrate in the world.<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Isn&#039;t it mysogynistic?<\/span><br>No. 3 women convert to Islam for every male convert. Women realise feminism is a false gospel and only when you find your purpose in life you can be truely happy. Yes Islam commands modesty but so did the west for millenia. People know start to realise that&#039;s the norm. It is time that \/pol\/ realises that too. The 4 wives you will have are a bonus.<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Isn&#039;t it anti-nationalistic?<\/span><br>No. Islam commands us to respect all races and cultures and only cut out the blasphemous and degenerate aspects. That&#039;s why Islam in Indonesia differs greatly from say SA Islam. Obviously like christianity the religion itself hass no boundaries by country but it very well respects nations within. Without Islamic birth rates your race and nation will soon go extinct.","filename":"4ec98fe0f739d52bb37740609a96688e01c59cca32d77484352c5aa14beaad91","ext":".png","w":1437,"h":909,"tn_w":249,"tn_h":158,"tim":1493115042471,"time":1493115042,"md5":"Kry9YCndXBZjVEox6seM+w==","fsize":89757,"resto":0,"id":"3iqdDX6B","country":"DE","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"islam-general-chemo-edition","country_name":"Germany","replies":5,"images":1},{"no":122718968,"now":"04\/25\/17(Tue)06:11:06","name":"Anonymous","com":"<span class=\"quote\">&gt;What about my christian heritage?<\/span><br>What about it? Constantinople has been under Islamic rule for nearly 600 years now and is still the center of so called &quot;orthodox&quot; christianity. Christian minorities in Palestine, Egypt, etc. have been under Islamic rule much longer. Islam commands us to protect christians and jews, even zoroastrians.<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Isn&#039;t it treason?<\/span><br>Treason to what? God? Certainly not. Christianity is false and disproven and you know that. Nor will there ever be a massive christian revival in the way \/pol\/ desires. Islam however is the fastest growing religion in the world. Even if it weren&#039;t true you should ride the tiger. <br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;All my ancestors were christian<\/span><br>Your ancestors were pagans. Then a different form of pagan, than a different etc. Then catholics, maybe orthodox, then protestants, then atheists. Your ancestors desired to serve God. It is not bad that you have more knowledge about the right path to it. God is allmerciful.<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;What about inbreeding?<\/span><br>True. Remind me what bible verse is the cause of the west&#039;s rejection of cousin marriage? Correct, it doesn&#039;t exist. In fact, many prophets of the old testament practiced it. God doesn&#039;t consider cousin marriage evil, that doesn&#039;t mean secular laws against it must not be uphold.<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;What about pedophilia?<\/span><br>Same thing. Islam is the only religion that prohibits marriage for people not yet fit for marriage. For whites and asians with a more delayed development stricter rules can be created no questions asked.<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;But the hook nosed merchant told me all muslims are violent terrorists<\/span><br>Suicide is forbidden in Islam. These misguided murderers practice a wrong version of what they believe to be Islam. Islam promotes peace. In fact the word Islam steams from salam (shalom) which means peace.","time":1493115066,"resto":122718937,"id":"3iqdDX6B","country":"DE","country_name":"Germany"},{"no":122719606,"now":"04\/25\/17(Tue)06:21:16","name":"Anonymous","com":"Bump.","time":1493115676,"resto":122718937,"id":"T6BOUY5\/","country":"DE","country_name":"Germany"},{"no":122720551,"now":"04\/25\/17(Tue)06:35:38","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122718937\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122718937<\/a><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;see thread in catalog<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;check flag<\/span><br><br>top kek<br>germany is dead","time":1493116538,"resto":122718937,"id":"aHSpHug8","country":"CH","country_name":"Switzerland"},{"no":122720977,"now":"04\/25\/17(Tue)06:41:39","name":"Anonymous","filename":"taqiyya","ext":".png","w":1024,"h":1261,"tn_w":101,"tn_h":125,"tim":1493116899805,"time":1493116899,"md5":"cq8kwWrkVuoL6Awxk74Z4Q==","fsize":350743,"resto":122718937,"id":"jzg\/TGAn","country":"AU","country_name":"Australia"},{"no":122721031,"now":"04\/25\/17(Tue)06:42:39","name":"Anonymous","com":"Give me the Dawah.","time":1493116959,"resto":122718937,"id":"stP2GTiW","country":"US","country_name":"United States"}]},{"posts":[{"no":122705519,"now":"04\/25\/17(Tue)02:53:59","name":"Anonymous","com":"What do you guys think about people who live off the grid?

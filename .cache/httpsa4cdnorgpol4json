That being said I&#039;m a very religious person now and I see life as God&#039;s will and for me to kill myself would end any possible good I could possibly do in the future. If you understand that God allowed you to come into existence and if you know that he wants you to do good things within your existence then you should strive to do such at any point in your life. When you have no money, when you do have money, when you&#039;re homeless, when you have a mansion. You have the capacity to do good and make an impact anywhere on this planet because God allows you to. I believe that as fact but comment only with opinion. <br><br>Now relating to the first world bit, if you are in a position of wealth and or good capacity to give charity or some sort of good deeds then you should definitely do so at some point in your life. Good deeds are good deeds. You may or may not know the people you are kind towards but the actions are moral and there is a reason these interactions exist within our societies. Commit yourself to improving yourself and helping the people around your (family, friends, strangers) succeed in their life too. Your life has meaning because you are here on this planet. Solipsism is bullshit. Humanity was created with a purpose and we are will united with a spirituality that matches nothing else on the planet. Your life has meaning, don&#039;t let it go to waste.","time":1492233482,"resto":121169655,"id":"Xh4pBDnO","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":121176346,"now":"04\/15\/17(Sat)01:43:53","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121174000\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121174000<\/a><br>anyone who uses this board has an IQ of 90+ youre definitely smart enough probably have the same issue as me which involves 0 self motivation im trying to be a pharmacist at the age of 21 i cheated my way through high school taking online classes with answers posted on forums my diploma is a lie and im watching chemistry courses online now you just gotta have the mindset of not being a worthless piece of shit i didn&#039;t get a job till i was 20 spent 3 years as a neet","time":1492235033,"resto":121169655,"id":"qaWh\/pCJ","country":"US","country_name":"United States"}]},{"posts":[{"no":121171288,"now":"04\/15\/17(Sat)00:46:53","name":"Anonymous","sub":"SPAIN HATE THREAD","com":"Fuck you Spain it&#039;s your fault the shityy mestizos exist and it&#039;s your fault for letting them into my country, you&#039;d better apologize for this and fix the mess of your ancestors cocks why the fuck would your ancestors impregnate all the native women and leave.

Yes the Jews that do stereotypical Jew things suck, but it&#039;s not all Jews. Now pol think Trump is cucked and run by Jews because he shot a few out dated missiles at a government that used internationally banned, CHEMICAL WEAPONS on civilians....twice, and his son in law who works for him happens to be a Jew, just as Trump happens to be a Christian.

East Asians (Chinese, Japanese, Korean) have to memorize thousands of symbols that have only one meaning. Furthermore, because their language is hieroglyphic rather than phonetic, that means a single &quot;word&quot; can have numerous meanings. That means that unless you understand the context of a statement, there&#039;s no way to know the meaning.","filename":"chinese hieroglyphs","ext":".png","w":1280,"h":889,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":173,"tim":1492225733048,"time":1492225733,"md5":"dQ8ixhCHTJr\/ucFIF4GHUw==","fsize":85258,"resto":0,"id":"pOaJKfwT","country":"CA","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"what-the-fuck-is-the-point-of-using-hieroglyphs","country_name":"Canada","replies":161,"images":14,"omitted_posts":156,"omitted_images":13,"tail_size":50},{"no":121175794,"now":"04\/15\/17(Sat)01:37:46","name":"Anonymous","com":"And regarding dyslexia, if you have trouble reading or trouble with learning languages due to dyslexia, you may not have those troubles with asian languages.

They&#039;ll almost always assume that times are bad for them if they&#039;re isolated enough from people who have worse problems. The result is that you get people in first world countries, like, say, Denmark or the United States, making a big deal out of problems that are slight when compared to genocide in less fortunate locales. They have to find a target for their disapproval, yet lack a serious one, and as a result they target the nonexistent &quot;patriarchy&quot; or claim that black lives don&#039;t matter to the police.","time":1492234961,"resto":121127943,"id":"Rq6oyi9e","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":121176253,"now":"04\/15\/17(Sat)01:42:55","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121175498\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121175498<\/a><br>Imo, this hijacking of the normal, natural, and healthy desire to make the world a better place is what gives Marxism its appeal year after year, because it is a secular thinker attempting to solve a moral problem (exploitation and oppression) through restructuring society.

Progressive\/PC culture is the end result when we put &#039;freedom&#039; as our highest value, without realizing that unlimited freedom doesn&#039;t bring life. The only way to be absolutely free is to be dead. Even if you have all your needs met, you can&#039;t be free of time, you can&#039;t be free of gravity. Fences, and rules are often for our benefit, though it isn&#039;t always obvious. Like saving sex for marriage. It seems like such a freedom-killer, but in reality, being a virgin on your wedding night is one of the best ways to ensure that you survive and thrive. I could go on and on, but I think the overarching course of action is to ask: How can we comport ourselves in the world in such a way so that I survive and thrive as an individual, and we survive and thrive as a collective? And how can we arrange ourselves, and society, so that it is good for us, not only for today, but tomorrow, next week, next month, next year, and for the next generation?","time":1492234975,"resto":121127943,"id":"6\/8BrWWU","country":"CA","country_name":"Canada"}]}]}

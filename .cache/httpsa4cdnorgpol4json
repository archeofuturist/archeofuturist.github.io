Six cases of rat lungworm disease have so far been confirmed in Maui in the last three months, with more episodes currently being investigated. Given the island had only experienced two documented cases of rat lungworm in the decade before this outbreak, the sudden increase is causing concern. Rat lungworm disease is caused by the parasitic roundworm Angiostrongylus cantonensis, with the adult form of the parasite found only in rats. <\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;The infection is spread when rats carrying the parasite excrete the larvae of the roundworm in their faeces. From there, it can be picked up by other animals, such as snails, slugs, freshwater shrimp, crabs, and frogs. If people handle or consume any of these infected animals \u2013 or come into contact with them on contaminated food sources, such as raw fruit and vegetables \u2013 they too can become infected.<\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;For many, there are no symptoms, and most people recover from the infection on their own. But in some cases, the worm moves into the brain and nervous system, resulting in a parasitic form of meningitis that can cause intense headaches, tremors, numbness, and fever symptoms \u2013 and which can ultimately turn out to be fatal.<\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;&quot;The parasites are in the lining of my brain, moving around,&quot; Maui resident and preschool worker Tricia Mynar, who believes she contracted the infection while on the Big Island, told Honolulu Civil Beat. &quot;It was like someone suddenly took a lei needle and pushed it through the soft spot on top of my head, then pushed it down below my left ear, then up to my left temple, then moved from back to front behind my right eye.

A totalitarian state has replaced the carefree rural life, dominated by &quot;the Rules&quot; and suffering from &quot;no beer and very little food.&quot; Journeying deeper into the Shire reveals a devastated countryside. Homes have been replaced by ugly row houses and barracks, trees have been wantonly felled, and the old mill has been replaced by &quot;a great brick building straddling the stream, which it fouled with a steaming and stinking outflow.&quot; <\/span><br><br>Mordor has come home; everything the hobbits have fought so hard for has been ruined. At first glance, Frodo and the others blame outside forces for the destruction. Evil men, brigands, and thieves have moved in while the protecting Rangers have gone to war. Sharkey, their leader, has urged them to &quot;hack, burn and ruin&quot; since his arrival. The hobbits soon learn that Sharkey is their old enemy Saruman, who has ravaged the Shire in revenge for his own losses.<br><br>The outsiders are not the only ones to blame, however. Like the evil of the Ring, the evil that besets the Shire works from within, feeding on the hobbits&#039; own desires. Lotho Sackville-Baggins, hungry for power and prestige, brought the first Men into the Four Farthings to protect his growing property. &quot;Seems he wanted to own everything himself, and then order other folk about,&quot; says Farmer Cotton.","filename":"the_shire","ext":".png","w":1080,"h":511,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":59,"tim":1491814777749,"time":1491814777,"md5":"KT2dQ6XDgoO63plBu5n5pw==","fsize":437131,"resto":120415800,"id":"Tus5ANqO","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":120416141,"now":"04\/10\/17(Mon)05:00:30","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120416086\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120416086<\/a><br>Other hobbits also accepted and even enjoyed the changes, regardless of the cost.

This is not really a general knowledge, but there are people talking about it. Our mafia\/deep state\/whatever you call it consists of leftovers from commie regime and all people who got rich through privatizations of national property during the transition from communism to capitalism.<br><br>The party that ruled for the last 2 terms (8 years) is directly in their hands, to the point where they were choosing the president - Donald Tusk, recently re-elected President of EU, was forced to opt out of the Polish presidental race in favour of Bronis\u0142aw Komorowski, who was less ambitious and more of a puppet to our &quot;deep mafia&quot;. We also have a lot of obvious EU\/Jewish influences; 4th biggest party is their direct puppet and we also have clearly EU-sponsored legit commies who luckily didn&#039;t get into our parliament.<br><br>You&#039;d think that Kaczy\u0144ski and his Law and Justice, often described as &quot;far right&quot;, would be out of the influence, but no. He&#039;s decently out of the EU influence, but not out of the influence of our &quot;mafia&quot;. In this regard, he&#039;s a controlled opposition that still knows their limits and what to do and what not.<br><br>But I digress. Back to Polish mafia\/deep state. Like I said, these guys operate like mafia; they are concerned about making money. Any way is fine, they&#039;re outside of the law and everyone covers up for them. There was one prominent politician, Andrzej Lepper, who tried to uncover some of their crimes publicly, he eventually committed suicide; in months preceding his death a few of his close associates committed suicide as well. This is not an isolated case at all either. If they can do this for money, why not child trafficking? Just another business to them.","time":1491814697,"resto":120408707,"id":"KxTPnm\/X","country":"PL","country_name":"Poland"},{"no":120416180,"now":"04\/10\/17(Mon)05:00:58","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120415649\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120415649<\/a><br>look here idiot, and its old data<br>https:\/\/www.nik.gov.pl\/en\/news\/nik-<wbr>on-missing-persons-search.html<br><br>its a quite big town per year","time":1491814858,"resto":120408707,"id":"m+l\/qYN9","country":"PL","country_name":"Poland"},{"no":120416347,"now":"04\/10\/17(Mon)05:03:23","name":"Anonymous","filename":"playing connect the dots","ext":".png","w":1681,"h":6531,"tn_w":32,"tn_h":125,"tim":1491815003836,"time":1491815003,"md5":"qSmH4TCsqffYJxubDgdoaw==","fsize":940041,"resto":120408707,"id":"sItR4ZZL","country":"US","m_img":1,"country_name":"United States"},{"no":120417922,"now":"04\/10\/17(Mon)05:24:25","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120416347\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120416347<\/a><br>what the fuck","time":1491816265,"resto":120408707,"id":"EoXHgF3T","country":"NL","country_name":"Netherlands"},{"no":120418106,"now":"04\/10\/17(Mon)05:26:45","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120415985\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120415985<\/a><br>Thank you anon, that&#039;s a good read and quite scary, not all is what it seems.<br><br>Here take this picture","filename":"Verdon Gorge, France (Provence)","ext":".jpg","w":5135,"h":3327,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":80,"tim":1491816405547,"time":1491816405,"md5":"gbQ+j\/upJw2CyyxiwMkphQ==","fsize":1383779,"resto":120408707,"id":"EoXHgF3T","country":"NL","m_img":1,"country_name":"Netherlands"}]}]}

Mr. Roof turned down an offer to address the court directly on Monday, leaving his grandfather as his only advocate. It was the first time a relative had spoken on his behalf in court.<br>\u201cEveryone should understand that nothing is all bad, and Dylann is not all bad,\u201d Joseph Roof said, adding that he and his wife pray each day for the victims\u2019 families. \u201cThere\u2019s no way we could ever feel what they\u2019ve felt and what they\u2019ve lost, just as no one can understand what we\u2019ve been through.\u201d<br><br>The elder Mr. Roof, who occasionally attended the federal trial, said he still could not fathom what had driven his grandson to such violence in the expressed hope of inciting a race war. \u201cI will go to my grave not understanding what happened,\u201d he said.<br><br>The 80-minute hearing Monday effectively ended the trial-level prosecution of Mr. Roof, who turned 23 a week ago. He is expected to be transferred soon to a federal penitentiary to await execution while appealing the death sentences he received in United States District Court.","filename":"dylanroof","ext":".jpg","w":768,"h":548,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":178,"tim":1491904054769,"time":1491904054,"md5":"FUldcxi6Lk0dCmSW9ql\/MQ==","fsize":55287,"resto":0,"id":"Ph48pB1B","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"does-anyone-else-find-him-hauntingly-beautiful","country_name":"United States","replies":61,"images":9,"omitted_posts":56,"omitted_images":9},{"no":120591415,"now":"04\/11\/17(Tue)08:25:38","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120591246\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120591246<\/a><br>no they&#039;re not, people called him a terrorist instantly","time":1491913538,"resto":120579258,"id":"p4sxELpx","country":"AU","country_name":"Australia"},{"no":120591682,"now":"04\/11\/17(Tue)08:28:18","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120583054\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120583054<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;faggot detected<\/span>","time":1491913698,"resto":120579258,"id":"wZZD9xlJ","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":120592008,"now":"04\/11\/17(Tue)08:31:42","name":"Anonymous","com":"Holy fuck what happened to \/pol\/?!?!! <br>After the mlp fiasco, the faggots were supposed to an hero, but the faggots stayed","time":1491913902,"resto":120579258,"id":"wZZD9xlJ","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":120592260,"now":"04\/11\/17(Tue)08:34:21","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120591249\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120591249<\/a><br>No. More realistically between 15-20 until he gets martyrdom","time":1491914061,"resto":120579258,"id":"wZZD9xlJ","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":120593019,"now":"04\/11\/17(Tue)08:42:12","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120583463\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120583463<\/a><br><br>Shut up northern jew Russian rape baby Turk.","time":1491914532,"resto":120579258,"id":"X\/3\/n8GK","country":"US","country_name":"United States"}]},{"posts":[{"no":120587740,"now":"04\/11\/17(Tue)07:43:33","name":"Anonymous","com":"Why do americans shot kids during their martial disputes ?","filename":"cedric-anderson-karen-smith[1]","ext":".jpg","w":960,"h":720,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":187,"tim":1491911013091,"time":1491911013,"md5":"TcZhwbKfYc3DBDMUk3VaKQ==","fsize":63401,"resto":0,"id":"dl94BVQt","country":"FR","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"why-do-americans-shot-kids-during-their-martial","country_name":"France","replies":10,"images":2,"omitted_posts":5,"omitted_images":2},{"no":120591126,"now":"04\/11\/17(Tue)08:22:36","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120591041\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120591041<\/a><br>Denmark hasn&#039;t even heard of it happening yet.<br>So, anons - fill me in?","time":1491913356,"resto":120587740,"id":"76N30y0R","country":"DK","country_name":"Denmark"},{"no":120592089,"now":"04\/11\/17(Tue)08:32:33","name":"Anonymous","com":"I&#039;m in SoCal.

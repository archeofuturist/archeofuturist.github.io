Taking a moment away from housework to bitch about teenagers. <br><br>We&#039;re currently undergoing a huge administrative change in our school. Some of the changes are good, some are very bad. But part of the shift is that our scores are terrible. We&#039;re in the bottom 1\/3 of schools in the state, our literacy scores are abysmal, and many of our sophomores (15-16) still haven&#039;t mastered Algebra. <br><br>Here&#039;s the thing, though. Instead of a radical shift in how we teach, the types of students we accept, or a simple reallocation of funding, the new admin has decided to ramp up the services we provide and hold teachers even more accountable than we already are..<br><br>As a teacher of 8 years who doesn&#039;t even break $60k, I work like a dog to educate my classes, advise clubs, mentor kids, and perform all the duties or extra duties of my profession. It&#039;s my passion project, I suppose.<br><br>But consistently and without fail, I receive weaker and weaker students, year after year. I keep my bar set high and rarely alter the level of my content, but I have had to reteach very basic skills students should have by their teen years. Things like writing an essay longer than 1 page, long division, graphing, reading for pleasure, handling money, or even academic discourse are all skills lost on modern American youths.<br><br>I sound like a grandpa, I know. &quot;Kids were always this way,&quot; you&#039;ll say. But this feels so different to me. This can&#039;t be the same thing as when I was in school. It just can&#039;t. My teachers complained, but it was on a whole different level.<br><br>The other week, we had a boy fall from the bleachers and nearly crack his back. He was carried out on a stretcher. And what was his first concern? He had to post the story on Snapchat. He was more scared of his PHONE breaking than him being injured. I watched as he was being carried out. The boy was crying for his friends to toss him his phone so he could take pictures of his accident and &quot;snap&quot; it.","filename":"1355832499066","ext":".jpg","w":556,"h":501,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":225,"tim":1491918376093,"time":1491918376,"md5":"LmfxdA1w+k+gSuNF37QsbQ==","fsize":74769,"resto":0,"id":"9CTe\/Px8","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"american-public-school-teacher-on-spring-break","country_name":"United States","replies":40,"images":2,"omitted_posts":35,"omitted_images":2},{"no":120602069,"now":"04\/11\/17(Tue)10:12:31","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120600695\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120600695<\/a><br>The first line makes this sound like bait, but I know it isn&#039;t.<br><br>I&#039;ll answer each piece with an honest and open answer. I&#039;m enjoying this thread so far.<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;What do you think is the main cause for the stupidity?<\/span><br>The families. Nobody values education anymore. The people who value education send their kids anywhere BUT a public school. For the rest of them, public school is just a necessary evil. Drop your kid off for babysitting, then complain when they get bad reports and blame it on the school. Lather, rinse, repeat.<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Is it the younger education?<\/span><br>A lot of elementary ed is now focused on &quot;feelings&quot; and &quot;teamwork.&quot; So, yes. I remember doing math drills in 3rd grade, doing research papers in 4th, and teaching my peers lessons in 5th. Nobody does that anymore. It&#039;s become &quot;one size fits all, and that size is an IQ of 70.&quot;<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Parents suck?<\/span><br>Already addressed this. But you would not believe how many parents yell at me or the school when their kid fucks up. We had a boy failing EVERYTHING. Literally. And the mom called the teachers, counselors, admin, and then the superintendent to pass the blame. Now we&#039;re getting sued by the family for &quot;failing the kid.&quot; I wish I could make this up. The boy doesn&#039;t complete assignments, turns in half-finished essays and whatnot... But it&#039;s OUR fault as a school that he has 40%&#039;s in all of his courses? Even with a documented paper trail that we called home and sent letters? Ridiculous.<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Common Core?<\/span><br>I don&#039;t really see it much yet. Still teaching 2000&#039;s babies. BUT I actually like some of the new standards, to be honest. Streamlines shit much easier for me. Plus they&#039;re a lot broader, so it&#039;s simpler to go &quot;off tangent&quot; and teach things that I haven&#039;t taught before.<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Technology?<\/span><br>THIS. THIS is the biggest fuck up (besides parents). If you take a teenagers phone, it&#039;s like cutting off their arm and slapping them with it. A lot of my students don&#039;t even know how to use emails they&#039;re such phone addicts.","time":1491919951,"resto":120599262,"id":"9CTe\/Px8","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":120602151,"now":"04\/11\/17(Tue)10:13:14","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120599262\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120599262<\/a><br>Teach in a private school.

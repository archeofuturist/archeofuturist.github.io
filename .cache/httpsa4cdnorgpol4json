Then, a period of class struggle follows in which the capitalist class is liquidated by the working class. When the capitalist class has been completely vanquished, there will be only one class, the working class, and eventually the functions of the state will become indistinguishable from the functions of the society as a whole, and the state as such will &#039;wither away&#039; as Marx

Any natural resource which is inherently limited in supply can generate economic rent, but the classical and most significant example of &#039;land monopoly&#039; involves the extraction of common ground rent from valuable urban locations. Georgists argue that taxing economic rent is efficient, fair, and equitable. The main Georgist policy is a tax assessed on land value. Georgists argue that revenues from a land value tax (LVT) can reduce or eliminate existing taxes on labor and investment that are unfair and inefficient. Some Georgists also advocate for the return of surplus public revenue back to the people by means of a basic income or citizen&#039;s dividend.","filename":"AnarchismTree09","ext":".gif","w":586,"h":378,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":80,"tim":1490801309004,"time":1490801309,"md5":"7QPD8RGPI7DZoPFc+kgttQ==","fsize":37377,"resto":118793798,"id":"k6ZwG071","country":"US","country_name":"United States"}]},{"posts":[{"no":118792537,"now":"03\/29\/17(Wed)10:45:30","name":"Anonymous","sub":"#Pizzagate\/#Pedogate - David Seaman Drops Out of Research Community After Much Drama","com":"https:\/\/youtu.be\/lJrv2ziZJ1s","filename":"david-seaman-pizzagate","ext":".jpg","w":1280,"h":720,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":140,"tim":1490798730595,"time":1490798730,"md5":"iL9pelbjKgqf6x3g7oloew==","fsize":80460,"resto":0,"id":"F9Ka8g9Q","country":"US","m_img":1,"bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"pizzagatepedogate-david-seaman-drops-out-of","country_name":"United States","replies":7,"images":1,"omitted_posts":2,"omitted_images":1},{"no":118795906,"now":"03\/29\/17(Wed)11:21:29","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118792537\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118792537<\/a><br>He never researched anything.","time":1490800889,"resto":118792537,"id":"TsARip7x","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":118796105,"now":"03\/29\/17(Wed)11:23:42","name":"Anonymous","com":"bumpers<br>31... he looks 45","time":1490801022,"resto":118792537,"id":"BfO7L3Yp","country":"NO","country_name":"Norway"},{"no":118796222,"now":"03\/29\/17(Wed)11:24:54","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118792537\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118792537<\/a><br><br>he still shilling gold certificates?","time":1490801094,"resto":118792537,"id":"2vhoF\/+K","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":118796343,"now":"03\/29\/17(Wed)11:26:08","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118795906\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118795906<\/a><br>this. he just repeats whatever someone else finds.","time":1490801168,"resto":118792537,"id":"cVvbe35Z","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":118796556,"now":"03\/29\/17(Wed)11:28:29","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118792537\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118792537<\/a><br>Seaman is an attention whore, always was.

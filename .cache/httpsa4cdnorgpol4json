I saw this thread yesterday and thought it was a great idea. I&#039;ll recommend two resources, one is a book called GERMS and it is all about the history of biowar and bioterrorism. It goes into a bit of theory. Also I read a homeland security textbook once (once chapter of it, total was over a thousand pages) where they talk about all the different types of terrorism and protocols to respond. That book would be REALLY useful in terms of a happening, I forget what it was called other than &quot;DHS Textbook&quot; and I found it in the context of bioterrorism research (for a class).<br><br>The other resource that is pretty good is a person who actually seems to be a consultant (in a psychology\/philosophy speech giving kind of way, as far as I know) for NSA, Secret Service, DARPA, etc etc. His name is Richard Thieme and he speaks at DefCon pretty much every year in a row for over 20 years. He is getting old but still a very nice guy, even if he isn&#039;t as technical as much as a cold war era guy. Honestly I think just about all of his speeches are good, even though when he gave a biohacking speech it was fairly non-technical. He isn&#039;t an engineer, his background is in religion and philosophy and he gives talks on psychology to spooks, basically https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/results?sea<wbr>rch_query=Richard+Thieme","filename":"1492452296292 (1)","ext":".jpg","w":720,"h":665,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":230,"tim":1492526394572,"time":1492526394,"md5":"Zv4WHtDAitqxGS8OdobHjw==","fsize":52630,"resto":0,"id":"zSnsRK5G","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"deep-state-reading-list","country_name":"United States","replies":4,"images":0},{"no":121691918,"now":"04\/18\/17(Tue)10:46:53","name":"Anonymous","com":"he talks a lot about working for agencies in crisis times and burn out that happens to people who work with classified information in high stakes for their career. i guess that is his specialty, secondary trauma, paranoia, etc.<br>&quot;The Impact of SEcrets and Dark Knowledge&quot; https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=Iow<wbr>HTVxHpAs<br><br>&quot;The only way to tell the truth is in fiction&quot; https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=Eds<wbr>JulQdUcg<br><br>&quot;The Government and UFOs&quot; https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=r8k<wbr>5kGbCR0M<br><br>&quot;Hacking the human body&quot; https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=KDP<wbr>LV4S6hgQ <br><br>here is a speech from another deep state hacker (who is known by the public) his name is Mudge he was a famous hacker in the 90s who ended up starting DARPA&#039;s cyber grant program after 2000 and he talks about a few funny things like hanging out with Julian Assange (in Germany, iirc) and iirc he left DARPA for Google.<br>&quot;Unexpected Stories -<br> From a hacker who made it inside the government&quot; https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=h9w<wbr>Xq6oRBnI","time":1492526813,"resto":121691287,"id":"zSnsRK5G","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":121692216,"now":"04\/18\/17(Tue)10:50:11","name":"Anonymous","com":"any recommendations on other good DEF CON speakers to watch on YouTube?","time":1492527011,"resto":121691287,"id":"zSnsRK5G","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":121692819,"now":"04\/18\/17(Tue)10:56:22","name":"Anonymous","com":"Bumping for interest","time":1492527382,"resto":121691287,"id":"nhWm0JFT","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":121694640,"now":"04\/18\/17(Tue)11:13:45","name":"Anonymous","com":"Bump","time":1492528425,"resto":121691287,"id":"84CWGp\/K","country":"RS","country_name":"Serbia"}]},{"posts":[{"no":121687904,"now":"04\/18\/17(Tue)10:03:46","name":"Anonymous","sub":"Wikipedia page about the battle of berkeley","com":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/2017_<wbr>Berkeley_protests<br>https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/2017_<wbr>Berkeley_protests<br>https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/2017_<wbr>Berkeley_protests<br><br><br>i honestly have no words this thing is so left sided","filename":"1482427554264","ext":".jpg","w":640,"h":640,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":250,"tim":1492524226878,"time":1492524226,"md5":"e9KiBF6yUYfgMPi2qRtM4A==","fsize":61361,"resto":0,"id":"yJf+7KvE","country":"CA","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"wikipedia-page-about-the-battle-of-berkeley","country_name":"Canada","replies":11,"images":8,"omitted_posts":6,"omitted_images":5},{"no":121690096,"now":"04\/18\/17(Tue)10:27:27","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121687904\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121687904<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;mentions head punch<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;does not mention bike lock<\/span>","filename":"1457448459160","ext":".jpg","w":413,"h":395,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":119,"tim":1492525647045,"time":1492525647,"md5":"lmsfJL\/tSPFZYrDXLHMj0A==","fsize":18095,"resto":121687904,"id":"48X\/WXoa","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":121692088,"now":"04\/18\/17(Tue)10:48:49","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121689738\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121689738<\/a><br><a href=\"#p121689820\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121689820<\/a><br>pls anon, don&#039;t do this","filename":"swt","ext":".jpg","w":528,"h":705,"tn_w":93,"tn_h":125,"tim":1492526929684,"time":1492526929,"md5":"o\/OHuQrmVbbPPorFJ75NrQ==","fsize":79111,"resto":121687904,"id":"\/hUkqC0a","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":121692207,"now":"04\/18\/17(Tue)10:50:08","name":"Anonymous","com":"Wikipedia hasn&#039;t been called a legitimate source in over 10 years.

They were showing all these clips of rabid niggers attacking whites, and it eventually came to the footage of the Reginald Denny attack. If there&#039;s ever another riot like that, I&#039;m not talking Baltimore or weak shit like that, but a scenario where people are getting killed and police have given up, I&#039;m going hunting. I&#039;m going to get my gun, body armor, BoB, etc and go to the no-go zone and shoot every brown person I see. That shit pissed me off so much. I need to hear some nigger justice stories to calm down.<br>Was anyone here in LA when the riots happened? I saw one greentext a while back about an anon who&#039;s father was an ex-marine sniper an they shot nigs with pellet guns, does anyone had stories like that? Preferably LA riots, but any nog justice will do.","filename":"image","ext":".jpg","w":484,"h":484,"tn_w":249,"tn_h":249,"tim":1493618635408,"time":1493618635,"md5":"IB2s\/x1XPlz0bZXfXPqHqQ==","fsize":62625,"resto":0,"id":"4JGTfSwG","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"i-was-flipping-through-channels-tonight-and-i","country_name":"United States","replies":17,"images":8,"omitted_posts":12,"omitted_images":7},{"no":123588073,"now":"05\/01\/17(Mon)02:26:56","name":"Anonymous","com":"Cheap meme for cheap thread","filename":"1o7ab2","ext":".jpg","w":682,"h":500,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":91,"tim":1493620016575,"time":1493620016,"md5":"PKBNM7vr9qKu9Ps1h8WjQA==","fsize":98729,"resto":123586233,"id":"Zjr6wwZ9","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":123588717,"now":"05\/01\/17(Mon)02:35:20","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123587868\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123587868<\/a><br>Yup. From this data, you can plausibly argue that 1% of black people in the US commit a serious enough crime every year. That&#039;s fucking dangerous. Just imagine a high school with 1000 students, where half of them are black. This means that every year you&#039;ll have 5 being detained for some serious crime. Throughout my whole school life, my schools had 0 people in such cases - fucking 0.<br><br>Then look at the 8% figure. Let&#039;s drop the number to 5% for those complaining people are being arrested for possessing weed or some shit. This means that 5% of black people are truly socially deviant and potentially dangerous.<br><br>He ends by claiming 91% of murders are against other blacks. However, he forgets to mention that even liberals like him actively keep away from most blacks just by virtue of where they choose to live.<br><br>I find it amazing that he believes those figures, which are much lower for other groups, are actually an argument against trying to keep away from blacks.","time":1493620520,"resto":123586233,"id":"QPPGiJBP","country":"PT","country_name":"Portugal"},{"no":123588823,"now":"05\/01\/17(Mon)02:36:45","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123587838\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123587838<\/a><br>MUST SECURE","time":1493620605,"resto":123586233,"id":"SJuiM9+k","country":"ES","country_name":"Spain"},{"no":123588830,"now":"05\/01\/17(Mon)02:36:50","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123586654\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123586654<\/a><br>apparently you will if there&#039;s a baboon riot","time":1493620610,"resto":123586233,"id":"DQgsCF1S","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":123589276,"now":"05\/01\/17(Mon)02:42:58","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123586233\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123586233<\/a><br>anon you gotta understand, vigilante justice doesn&#039;t really work, you&#039;ll either end up arrested, or if you DO manage to cap a nog or two, they&#039;ll just be turned into martyrs<br><br>you gotta go about it in a more subtle way, like I do<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;homeless nig asks me for change<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;tell him I&#039;ll give him change if he yells &quot;Gas the kikes&quot;<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;slowly over time, drop redpills here and there<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;he eventually goes full 1488<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;rinse and repeat for all the homeless I see on my daily walks<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;they pass on the redpills throughout their own bum networks further converting more people<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;I&#039;ll eventually have my own personal Wehrmacht<\/span><br>On the day of the rope, they&#039;ll be the first frontline.","filename":"59c","ext":".jpg","w":599,"h":600,"tn_w":124,"tn_h":125,"tim":1493620978223,"time":1493620978,"md5":"Rmk+HhlByKgatPVdmVTpvA==","fsize":37435,"resto":123586233,"id":"z\/9WttTk","country":"US","country_name":"United States"}]},{"posts":[{"no":123567239,"now":"04\/30\/17(Sun)22:48:05","name":"Anonymous","com":"You have ten seconds to give me one good reason why race mixing is wrong.<br><br><br>hell I&#039;ll give you ten minutes.","filename":"1491501201168","ext":".jpg","w":640,"h":960,"tn_w":166,"tn_h":250,"tim":1493606885034,"time":1493606885,"md5":"d0RJ2RRDVm5kCJ6\/FU0j0Q==","fsize":75970,"resto":0,"id":"cK0MkLO6","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"you-have-ten-seconds-to-give-me-one-good-reason","country_name":"United States","replies":147,"images":25,"omitted_posts":142,"omitted_images":25,"tail_size":50},{"no":123588202,"now":"05\/01\/17(Mon)02:28:32","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123575745\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123575745<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Those aren&#039;t races, those are ethnicities<\/span><br>btfo autistic NEET","time":1493620112,"resto":123567239,"id":"Fjad5Vh2","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":123588227,"now":"05\/01\/17(Mon)02:28:45","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123569507\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123569507<\/a><br><br>There is overwhelming proof that different races have different average IQ, and that blacks are the lowest (and arabs are pretty dumb too).

These people will undoubtedly have more say over world events than the common people because of their accumulated wealth. What I am saying is that the checks on such power have been eroded in America and the power of the common people has been eroded. It needs to be brought back in line. You see this happening with groups such as Occupy and the Tea Party Movement. Granted, they suffer from the same us vs them problem as republicans vs democrats but they are both fueled by a common anger against the established order. <br><br>Saints and Martyrs are powerful weapons of control sure. Symbols are powerful. It is possible to create symbols that are non-hijack-able because of the core principals they stand for and are inseparable from though. They are not always so easily corrupted. You don&#039;t see the establishment trying to use Martin Luther King Jr, or Theodore Roosevelt to further their agenda do you? These were people who stood against racism and economic tyranny and you rarely ever hear them being used as symbolic weapons in political debates here in America.

They count on that sort of self-loathing behavior to keep you from spreading you ideas. Go out and converse. Challenge people&#039;s views on life. Talk to your friends. You have some though you think you may not. Free speech is the first thing to be limited anytime the power of the elite is challenged precisely because it is so threatening to them. The truth is that they are afraid of ideas.","time":1492920738,"resto":122350076,"id":"qWqkf3\/k","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":122377878,"now":"04\/23\/17(Sun)00:14:38","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122350076\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122350076<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;our <\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;we<\/span><br>Fuck off Reddit tourist.

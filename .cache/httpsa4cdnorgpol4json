A version of the above photograph appeared in The New York Times Magazine on page 42 of the Sunday, May 6th, 1945 edition, without the naked gentleman by the post on the right of the photograph.<\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;In that previous article I was relying on a copy I&#039;d purchased and downloaded from The New York Times online archive. And it is an awful copy. So since then I have been endeavouring to track down a better copy of this photo, and this morning I finally succeeded. But it&#039;s been a lot of effort, and ended-up costing me over a (U.S.) $100. I first brought an original copy of the May 6th, 1945 edition of The New York Times, which arrived without the magazine section, I visited the National Art Library in London with the deluded belief they had a copy, I contacted the Library of Congress, who I must say were amazingly helpful, and provided me with several copies from the micro-film records they hold (unfortunately another terrible copy), but eventually I found a copy of the magazine on eBay! It was listed with the incorrect date, but as the Library of Congress had provided me with a copy of the front cover of the May 6th, 1945 edition, I knew it was the one I was after. I quickly paid for it, and have been eagerly awaiting its arrival.<\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;The Most Famous Holocaust Photo a Fraud<\/span><br>http:\/\/archive.is\/llHMk","time":1491011890,"resto":119109927,"id":"f9Sxmc76","country":"US","country_name":"United States"}]},{"posts":[{"no":119127283,"now":"03\/31\/17(Fri)21:33:57","name":"Anonymous","com":"Nihilism is the ultimate redpill.

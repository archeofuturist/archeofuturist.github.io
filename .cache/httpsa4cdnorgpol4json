We were on the 72nd floor - essentially right below the &#039;strike&#039;. Yet the stairwells all the way down were bearable heat wise so I&#039;m not buying the &quot;The fire burned so hot it melted the steel beams&quot; notion at all. We were told that a incident took place in WTC I and we should stay put until further notice so the evacuation of that building isn&#039;t compromised. Shortly after we felt a severe shock that knocked me and others out of their chairs as well as cubicle walls. Many of us decided to nix the directive to stay put. We used the stairs and heard, consistent (timed) explosions all the way down to the ground floor. Once we hit the Concourse it was a complete disaster: the walls, which are made of 15&quot; solid marble, had huge sections blasted away laying on the floor... some of it looked pulverized and some was like a powder scattered all around. One of the service elevators near the PATH train entrance had its doors blasted outward! Those steel doors were shredded!! Outside was chaos and it was difficult to tell what was going on, where to go for help, etc. I decided to get as far as I could from the building. I got about 3 blocks away on Fulton St. when I heard a series of high pitched explosive sounds and a something that sounded like a steam train trying to gather momentum. I turned around and saw the building I just left coming down with a pillar of dust and debris as tall as a office building barreling down the street. All I could do was hit the street, cover my head and pray. I stood up covered in a fine, grey dust with huge slabs of steel and glass all over the place. Why I didn&#039;t get impaled or crushed...I had no idea at the time. I&#039;ve since understood why.

He has received awards and\/or fellowships from the World Health Organization, the American Pediatric Association, the American Medical Writers Association, Guggenheim,[2] and the MacArthur Foundation,[3] among others. Werner is a founding member of the International People&#039;s Health Council... also been active in the Planning and Analytic Group for the People&#039;s Health Movement..<br><br>However,<br><br>&quot;Werner resigned from the organization in 1993 after board members voted for his dismissal following allegations that he had sexually abused teenaged Mexican boys in his care.&quot; Werner was never charged.<br><br>&quot;Board members say that reputation made it painful to oust Werner, and they are careful to say they have no direct knowledge of his sexual involvement with any child. But four board members and two staffers say that over the past year, Werner confirmed to them that he had sex with underage boys from Mexico, telling them he considered the encounters a positive influence on the children.<br><br>\u201cI said, \u2018These were sexual relationships with minors?\u2019 \u201d said Dr. Davida Coady, a Berkeley pediatrician who became Hesperian\u2019s president after Werner\u2019s resignation. Coady, a board member at the time, was in Guatemala when Werner resigned.<br>\u201cDavid said, \u2018Yes.\u2019 He said he never abused anybody, that it was part of mentoring.\u201d&quot;<br><br>Drawing by Werner from his website:(looks like he worships moloch) <br><br>This is all tied to Esalen and Tavi closely. <br><br>A guy on the Faculty of Esalen is a Co-director on Werner&#039;s site, and they co-authored articles together.

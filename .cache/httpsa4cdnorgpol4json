&#039;pagans&#039; are so barbaric, huh?<br><br> According to traditional Jewish religious belief, God is reputed to have singled out 75-year old Abraham among all people on earth and struck an arrangement with him, providing his progeny the consummate family inheritance: &quot;If Abraham will follow the commandments of God, then He, in His turn, will make the descendants of Abraham His Chosen People and place them under His protection ... God at this time stipulates only one commandment, and makes only one promise.&quot; [DIMONT, p. 29] The initial agreement, by modern standards, seems extraordinarily peculiar. God&#039;s commandment was that all males by the eighth day of birth must have the foreskin of their penises cut off, a painfully literal branding of Jewish distinction around the male procreative organ:<br> <br> &quot;God ... said to Abraham ... You shall circumcise the flesh of<br> the foreskin and that shall be the Covenant between Me<br> and you.&quot; GENESIS: 17:9-13<br> <br> With this physical marking, notes Barnet Litvinoff, \u201cno male child born of Jewish parentage is ever allowed to forget he is a Jew ... it reminds him of the doctrine of the chosen people.\u201d [LITVINOFF, p. 5] &quot;As a sign of this sacred bond, of being special seed, Chosen,&quot; note Herbert Russcol and Margarlit Banai, &quot;The Lord of the Universe commands Abraham&quot; to circumcize &quot;every man child among you.&quot; And as the Torah states it: &quot;I will establish my covenant between Me and thee and thy seed after thee in their generations for an everlasting covenant.&quot; [RUSSCOL\/BANAI, 1970, p. 173] Is this alleged commandment by God to the Abrahamic &quot;seed&quot; in Jewish tradition not racial?<br><br>http:\/\/holywar.org\/jewishtr\/02hos.h<wbr>tm","filename":"IMG_3848","ext":".jpg","w":265,"h":197,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":92,"tim":1491195226885,"time":1491195226,"md5":"PrNb9q70+90HK0GxBBG0nQ==","fsize":33620,"resto":119286274,"id":"0sfgvSwg","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":119292502,"now":"04\/03\/17(Mon)00:54:41","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119286274\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119286274<\/a><br>wish we could get trump to ban circumcision. it&#039;d be a blow to the kikes and muslims and a boon to human rights all at once. literally zero negatives.","time":1491195281,"resto":119286274,"id":"9oKeL3ML","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":119293042,"now":"04\/03\/17(Mon)01:00:53","name":"Anonymous","com":"Ancient Egyptians were circumcised at 13.","time":1491195653,"resto":119286274,"id":"1nuZFZgx","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":119294296,"now":"04\/03\/17(Mon)01:16:07","name":"Anonymous","com":"You anti-semitic Goyim disgust me. <br><br>Pic very related.

Allah\u2019s will governs the spin of every electron and the path of every bullet. It is unfathomable and arbitrary, like nature in the pagan world. Islam can endure horror, but not humiliation. But horror is the Achilles\u2019 heel of the Christian world, whose founding premise is that God offers unselfish love and unmerited grace to mankind, and in a sense stacked the deck in favor of goodness. The perception that the universe is cruel and without purpose is poison to Christianity. That is the great paradox of salvation: If God\u2019s unselfish love and unmerited grace offer salvation to all humankind, what are we to make of those to willfully reject it?<br><br>Judaism is more resilient in the face of horror, I think, because it assigns to humankind a higher degree of freedom, that is, the radical freedom to enter into partnership with the creator of the world and transform nature itself. The God that Judaism encounters in the world in which we find ourselves\u2013this God, and not a God that satisfies the sensibilities of philosophers or theologians\u2013left Creation intentionally incomplete so that man might have the freedom to become a partner in the work of creation. Chaos in the natural world and human wickedness are a divine challenge to humankind to rise to the status of co-creator. The possibility of radical freedom, of course, also implies the possibility of radical evil.&quot;<br><br>http:\/\/www.atimes.com\/more-horrible<wbr>-than-rape\/<br>t. based kike","time":1493891895,"resto":124041376,"id":"v\/CcRAyX","country":"DE","country_name":"Germany"},{"no":124044991,"now":"05\/04\/17(Thu)06:03:14","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p124044224\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;124044224<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;church sucks<\/span><br>Eh, here too and I would just end up being a secretly doubting pretend-christian anyway.<br>Good thing that our socities are not resting on our shoulders alone and other people can be faithful in our place while we try to breed nonetheless as rasing children itself already needs some sacrifiece and restraint.<br>Maybe our children believe in something when the denominations of the future can lead by example again and are of better quality after bleeding people.","time":1493892194,"resto":124041376,"id":"v\/CcRAyX","country":"DE","country_name":"Germany"},{"no":124045306,"now":"05\/04\/17(Thu)06:07:38","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p124041376\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;124041376<\/a><br>just go with a sort of spiritualism, find what you believe in and stick to it, if you find you don&#039;t actually believe in anything then say your atheist.<br><br>personally i think that god is benevolent and all people can commune with him, though it&#039;s a personal thing so i don&#039;t really go to church.","time":1493892458,"resto":124041376,"id":"zTGM37GY","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":124045467,"now":"05\/04\/17(Thu)06:10:00","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p124042531\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;124042531<\/a><br>underrated","time":1493892600,"resto":124041376,"id":"aS+Je8IM","country":"CA","country_name":"Canada"},{"no":124045576,"now":"05\/04\/17(Thu)06:11:37","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p124042531\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;124042531<\/a><br>Underrated","time":1493892697,"resto":124041376,"id":"tIIdTGXM","country":"FR","country_name":"France"}]},{"posts":[{"no":124023563,"now":"05\/04\/17(Thu)01:18:59","name":"Anonymous","com":"Can we finally become a Republic now?","filename":"Australia-1908-(blue)l","ext":".jpg","w":600,"h":300,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":125,"tim":1493875139211,"time":1493875139,"md5":"IxWvxsxHz93kCJx5Yo2cEg==","fsize":96355,"resto":0,"id":"srNkNtib","country":"AU","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"can-we-finally-become-a-republic-now","country_name":"Australia","replies":59,"images":9,"omitted_posts":54,"omitted_images":8},{"no":124043995,"now":"05\/04\/17(Thu)05:48:55","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p124042414\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;124042414<\/a><br>Yes, I do.<br><br>Federation was not about building a nation, it was about economics and trade policies, and as such, the federal government has very limited powers.<br>There&#039;s a reason every state has they own vehicle and license regulations, their own firearms legislations, etc.<br>The federal government, by design, does not have power that.<br><br>Becoming a Republic would open the door to states losing their executive rights and more and more legislation being created on a national basis.","time":1493891335,"resto":124023563,"id":"BHhS7Mxg","country":"AU","country_name":"Australia"},{"no":124044505,"now":"05\/04\/17(Thu)05:56:10","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p124023563\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;124023563<\/a><br>Nice to see the smaller of New Zealand&#039;s mountains come and kiss the ring today.<br><br>Become a Republic then annex the sheepentland.","filename":"images (2)","ext":".jpg","w":512,"h":288,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":70,"tim":1493891770977,"time":1493891770,"md5":"hq88VfTenkOPbz8tMbvk8w==","fsize":17551,"resto":124023563,"id":"EIN1YlNO","country":"AU","country_name":"Australia"},{"no":124044889,"now":"05\/04\/17(Thu)06:01:50","name":"Anonymous","com":"51st state<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Soon<\/span>","time":1493892110,"resto":124023563,"id":"uuPux6OZ","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":124045396,"now":"05\/04\/17(Thu)06:09:03","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p124043717\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;124043717<\/a><br>What tradition, drinking and doing drugs.

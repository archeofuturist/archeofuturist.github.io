When women were given the power to vote and influence culture they voted for their biological imperative for the most part and introduced a culture more willing to allow that. Civilization prospered for millenia because they knew that any form of sexual liberty or such would lead to the slow decay (although rapid in relative terms) of the society and it&#039;s eventual destruction. Women were once domesticated to some degree and their instincts were vigorously repressed for their own good and society&#039;s to make good and loyal housewives. The same goes to men for a degree, they were once more harshly treated to make them tough, resilient, hardworking, and better providers.

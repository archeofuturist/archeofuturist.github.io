Alt-right trolls see Trump\u2014and you\u2019ll be very surprised to hear this\u2014as a total and complete loser. To use their own deeply offensive terminology, alt-right trolls consider Trump a \u201cweaponized autist\u201d who is so clearly dysfunctional in every way that his election as president is hilarious. If you\u2019re thinking that it takes a real lack of situational awareness to not see how Trump could endanger the very nation alt-right trolls claim to love, and a real lack of empathy to not see (just because you think Trump couldn\u2019t or wouldn\u2019t ruin your own life) how Trump could ruin real lives, you\u2019re right. That\u2019s why many alt-right trolls come from middle-class or upper-middle-class upbringings\u2014they\u2019re essentially twerpy bourgeois assholes who use a lame brand of political dissent as cover for the fact that in a Marxist revolution they might well be the first ones up against the wall. (I make my point so graphically here only because I think this secret sense of being a fraudulent revolutionary is endemic to alt-right culture; they don\u2019t have anything more important to rebel against, so they betray a \u201csnowflake\u201d-like sensitivity to being triggered by far-left activists.

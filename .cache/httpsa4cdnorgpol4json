Cats are \u201cstealing the hearts of UK men\u201d, reports a delighted BBC, following a survey that found 17% of UK men now have a pet cat, up from 13% in 2016. Why might this be, a nation asks.<\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt; What this survey doesn\u2019t mention is age, and I bet it\u2019s men in their 30s and 40s who are really behind all this.

In fact, the only sacrifices I\u2019ve had to make are privacy in the shower, and a roughly \u00a350 annual spend on children\u2019s plasters.

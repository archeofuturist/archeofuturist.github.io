I&#039;m tall, actually moderately attractive, with a state job making ~145k a year in tech. I currently spend most of time free time reading, playing video games, working out, and cooking. Over the last 5 years or so I have slowly lost my desire for any kind of relationship with women. <br><br>I was not really a Chad, but I was one of the lucky few who was getting laid pretty steadily in high school, and on through college and my early adult life. I had my heart broken, and I broke some hearts. But the last 5 years I have really found the company of women in general to be less and less tolerable. Most of them want to talk about the same old boring shit. Whats on TV\/Movies\/Social Justice\/Whatever dumb hobby they&#039;re into. Given I live in a liberal infested shithole, it just seems like I can&#039;t find a single woman out there who brings any kind of excitement to the table anymore. Even the ones where politics is never brought up once. I don&#039;t drink often at all, not into the party scene. I despise degeneracy in general. I&#039;ve just gotten to the point where I&#039;m giving up hope on finding a decent companion, ya know? I can deal with it. Really, pussy is great and all, but it has seriously come to the point where I don&#039;t see it worth the effort of going through the motions of picking up women. Its like the same shit on repeat. Fuck it, I&#039;d rather just beat my meat in the shower every once in a while and call it even. <br><br>Given my growing apathy toward women in general, I&#039;ve come to question if this is strictly internal, or if the direction society is going is attributing to it. I didn&#039;t used to feel this way, but that was 5 years ago, before SJW, Cultural-marxism, and Socialism was mainstream. I see these &#039;anti-values&#039; reflected in the women I meet and it sickens me.<br><br>What does \/pol\/ think? Is society causing otherwise valuable males to drop out, and if so, how do we fix it, or am I just fucked in the head?","filename":"Going_alone","ext":".jpg","w":700,"h":465,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":166,"tim":1492567023156,"time":1492567023,"md5":"rCRUXoxcriU8GLVGpF29OQ==","fsize":37872,"resto":0,"id":"9eSNTXku","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"am-i-the-problem-or-is-it-society","country_name":"United States","replies":242,"images":40,"omitted_posts":237,"omitted_images":39,"tail_size":50},{"no":121809886,"now":"04\/19\/17(Wed)01:49:04","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121782238\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121782238<\/a><br>Seriously if Stephen Colbert just randomly replaced Alex Jones for one full 4 hour show, as a way of saying &quot;and though we know we won, sometimes we don&#039;t mind a good old troll!&quot; And Alex Jones was and is able to sit back and laugh and let the audience know later of course, (as they already do believe do they not?)

The one I like to point to is the incorruptibility of saint Bernadette, since the actual preservation (which keep in mind, is not the result of special treatment or the right conditions. Her wooden cross rotted in the coffin) has been verified by a medical Doctor, who wrote of it this:<br>&quot;I would have liked to open the left side of the thorax to take the ribs as relics and then remove the heart which I am certain must have survived. However, as the trunk was slightly supported on the left arm, it would have been rather difficult to try and get at the heart without doing too much noticeable damage. As the Mother Superior had expressed a desire for the Saint&#039;s heart to be kept together with the whole body, and as Monsignor the Bishop did not insist, I gave up the idea of opening the left-hand side of the thorax and contented myself with removing the two right ribs which were more accessible. ... What struck me during this examination, of course, was the state of perfect preservation of the skeleton, the fibrous tissues of the muscles (still supple and firm), of the ligaments, and of the skin, and above all the totally unexpected state of the liver after 46 years. One would have thought that this organ, which is basically soft and inclined to crumble, would have decomposed very rapidly or would have hardened to a chalky consistency. Yet, when it was cut it was soft and almost normal in consistency. I pointed this out to those present, remarking that this did not seem to be a natural phenomenon.&quot;<br>Pic related is her now, though she has a wax mask on due to some damage from the world wars IIRC. <br>Either way, a liver in near perfect condition after nearly 50 years is unheard of, esspecialy with no form of preservation.","filename":"image","ext":".jpg","w":293,"h":176,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":75,"tim":1492580723231,"time":1492580723,"md5":"L70PQFY17gAKreYT1fOnWA==","fsize":27537,"resto":121766039,"id":"+9sqlPC+","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":121810896,"now":"04\/19\/17(Wed)01:58:37","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121809490\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121809490<\/a><br>Have there been any other more recent, investigated miracles?

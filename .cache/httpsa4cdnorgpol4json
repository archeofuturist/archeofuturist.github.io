class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121579069<\/a><br>It was never decided, although it&#039;s arguably the most logical theory. What is known is that the unbaptised go to Hell, that until baptism they are stained with original sin, that the damned suffer unequal punishments and that God is perfectly just. Suppose that an unbaptised dies without any personal sin and enters Hell. Now, there is nothing worthy of punishment in them - so he isn&#039;t punished for sins. And yet his state doesn&#039;t allow him to enter Heaven. Such a state would be called limbo, which comes from Latin &quot;limbus&quot; - edge, border (of Hell). Resistance to this idea comes from the fact that God isn&#039;t bound to the sacrament and can work His graces even outside of them. The idea is that the children who die unbaptised are technically baptised - by some method God employs quickly before their death. Such a person would now, free of original sin, enter Heaven. Neither is a dogma, but there is logical reasoning here.","time":1492462506,"resto":121555457,"id":"xcC9p8Xc","country":"PL","country_name":"Poland"},{"no":121580738,"now":"04\/17\/17(Mon)16:56:45","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121579691\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121579691<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Saying someone is a &quot;rock&quot; doesn&#039;t mean papacy<\/span><br><br>There is the added bit that He will build His Church upon it.

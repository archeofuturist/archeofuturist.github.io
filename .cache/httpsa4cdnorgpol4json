Are Slavs a race? <br> I have to point out that US, South Slavs are most probably of illyrian and Thracian decent, but some generic Slavic marks are found all over the place. I found Russians who have exact facial marks as some people form here. That is even more obvious on women than men. <br><br>For example I have most Dinaric (noric) skull and body that you can find. I am 190 cm tall, I have gray-blue eyes and dark brown hair with that blond shine that you can see in the sun, my beard though is mostly blond. Thos hair traits you can find all over the Europe. But I am fully aware of my &#039;&#039;Vlah&#039;&#039; or &#039;&#039;Krajisnik&#039;&#039; face (nose, skull, eyes position, cheeks) and I think I look a lot different than a Bosniak or a Croat from the same region of Bosnia.. (Even though Bosniaks are NOT a really ethnic group). Few months ago I ran on a Russian guy who looks like a brother of my. I assure you the dude looked exactly like me. We both realized that and took a picture. All Slavs have same genetic heritage, but are we a race? <br>I think not, but what do you think?<br><br>I know, Varg is a bit pretentious as always, but he has some good points.<br>https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=HKy<wbr>tMPW4SmI","filename":"Slavic_tribes_in_the_7th_to_9th_century","ext":".jpg","w":1520,"h":1442,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":237,"tim":1491996425064,"time":1491996425,"md5":"Jo3DCrWlofN3qsuKN0zipQ==","fsize":653122,"resto":0,"id":"lVUR1w9\/","country":"BA","m_img":1,"bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"what-does-pol-think-are-slavs-a-race","country_name":"Bosnia and Herzegovina","replies":297,"images":75,"omitted_posts":292,"omitted_images":73,"tail_size":50},{"no":120791365,"now":"04\/12\/17(Wed)14:55:01","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120789768\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120789768<\/a><br>Well there&#039;s a reason you become a diasporafag.<br>Most of the time it&#039;s not because you had the choice, but because some Muslims laid siege on your town, started butchering your family, your friends family, raped the women before they killed them and son on. Expecting a diasporafag to be at peace with his past is not realistic, after all he didn&#039;t become a diasporafag because he liked it. He was forced to become a diasporafag. And once you are a diasporafag, and lets assume for one moment you are not a complete idiot, you will not go back. Why would you? You&#039;d have to go back and live right next to the same fuckers you hate so much. And those fucks have no problem living in a country that is a huge pile of shit, after all that&#039;s what they are too. At the same time if you are not a complete idiot or radical you will take the opportunity you were given and try to make the best out of your situation. Although I don&#039;t like the fact that I&#039;m a diasporafag I still appreciate my parents effort to bring me into a better world and give me the opportunity to grow up in a peaceful country. But when we, the diasporafags, are starting to read and see the same idiotic rhetoric of some &quot;brotherhood&quot; between muslims and the local population of our new found homelands that led to the wars in the first place, it&#039;s pretty normal that our PTSD will come through. <br>So yeah, asking a diasporafag his opinion on a topic like this is probably not the best thing to do. On the other hand it&#039;s probably also no the best thing for a diasporafag to answer to threads like these, cause it will only trigger him and make his blood pressure go up.","filename":"1485286356024","ext":".gif","w":188,"h":174,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":115,"tim":1492023301964,"time":1492023301,"md5":"eVPWAsPOAU7znK8CY3I7wA==","fsize":485150,"resto":120744704,"id":"oRhempli","country":"AT","country_name":"Austria"},{"no":120791511,"now":"04\/12\/17(Wed)14:56:20","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120791365\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120791365<\/a><br>Die.","time":1492023380,"resto":120744704,"id":"PaELq0ge","country":"DE","country_name":"Germany"},{"no":120791714,"now":"04\/12\/17(Wed)14:58:00","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120791365\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120791365<\/a><br>alright m8 chill out, I just thought it was funny. hope your country stops being a shithole soon.<br><br><a href=\"#p120791511\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120791511<\/a><br>t. destroyer of Europe","time":1492023480,"resto":120744704,"id":"P7Jcm\/Z\/","country":"NL","country_name":"Netherlands"},{"no":120791801,"now":"04\/12\/17(Wed)14:58:39","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120791057\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120791057<\/a><br><a href=\"#p120791352\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120791352<\/a><br>You will get fucked anally when the war comes xD <a href=\"\/pol\/thread\/120774072#p120774072\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120774072<\/a>","time":1492023519,"resto":120744704,"id":"BTDtPUED","country":"PL","country_name":"Poland"},{"no":120791853,"now":"04\/12\/17(Wed)14:59:05","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120790904\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120790904<\/a><br>Crimea is whatever, dozens of different peoples were there.

He might have this mousy face but he doesn&#039;t look sickly.<br>His sister&#039;s more like this ambiguous borderline white person who most people would think was white, I&#039;d kinda give her a pass on being white on the basis that I&#039;ve seen Greeks who look more Arab than her.<br><br><a href=\"#p120782976\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120782976<\/a><br>It&#039;s funny because my dad is completely Scottish, I&#039;ve tested both of my paternal grandparents&#039; DNA, and they&#039;re pure white, but my dad is and always has been this ruddy complexioned pig skin.","time":1492023488,"resto":120781822,"id":"CFLLgIll","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":120791792,"now":"04\/12\/17(Wed)14:58:35","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120791666\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120791666<\/a><br>Says the burger who have a kike&#039;s slave for president","time":1492023515,"resto":120781822,"id":"1ZIWwSGU","country":"FR","country_name":"France"}]},{"posts":[{"no":120791073,"now":"04\/12\/17(Wed)14:52:47","name":"Anonymous","sub":"Shia LaBTFO Once Again","com":"MAGA dance @ Kiasma","filename":"1","ext":".gif","w":498,"h":278,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":139,"tim":1492023167778,"time":1492023167,"md5":"+gOMhre3fwKxau7V3o8nfw==","fsize":3463726,"resto":0,"id":"RjcsrzW0","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"shia-labtfo-once-again","country_name":"United States","replies":2,"images":0},{"no":120791316,"now":"04\/12\/17(Wed)14:54:39","name":"Anonymous","com":"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=d3f<wbr>FrBdIM_w","time":1492023279,"resto":120791073,"id":"RjcsrzW0","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":120791790,"now":"04\/12\/17(Wed)14:58:33","name":"Anonymous","com":"context and frog sauce<br><a href=\"#p120791073\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120791073<\/a><br><a href=\"#p120791316\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120791316<\/a>","time":1492023513,"resto":120791073,"id":"+fOiCkKy","country":"US","country_name":"United States"}]},{"posts":[{"no":120776076,"now":"04\/12\/17(Wed)12:44:46","name":"Anonymous","sub":"What is causing this Mental Illness ?","com":"Seriously ?<br>WTF is causing this wide spread pandemic of mental illness<br><br>This guy is a beautiful woman now, <br>If you don&#039;t believe me you are a fascist","filename":"MentalSickness","ext":".jpg","w":3459,"h":1948,"tn_w":249,"tn_h":140,"tim":1492015486981,"time":1492015486,"md5":"zUnossnmyepRx8ZpN+MBVA==","fsize":318684,"resto":0,"id":"WeA3smWz","country":"US","m_img":1,"bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"what-is-causing-this-mental-illness","country_name":"United States","replies":51,"images":13,"omitted_posts":46,"omitted_images":13},{"no":120788703,"now":"04\/12\/17(Wed)14:33:45","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120776076\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120776076<\/a><br>the feminization of males in our culture and lack of male role models. boys being boys isn&#039;t PC anymore.","time":1492022025,"resto":120776076,"id":"8LfNs1gS","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":120788988,"now":"04\/12\/17(Wed)14:36:21","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"\/pol\/thread\/120772750#p120777777\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120777777<\/a>","time":1492022181,"resto":120776076,"id":"Cm0g\/n\/t","country":"SG","country_name":"Singapore"},{"no":120790035,"now":"04\/12\/17(Wed)14:44:52","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120776076\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120776076<\/a><br><br>Plastic bottles.","time":1492022692,"resto":120776076,"id":"tJ1ZHekX","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":120791260,"now":"04\/12\/17(Wed)14:54:15","name":"Anonymous","com":"These juiced up meatheads are typically pretty mentally unstable to begin with.

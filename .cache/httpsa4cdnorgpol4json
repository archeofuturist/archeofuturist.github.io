Indonesia and the Uyghur&#039;s, fair enough. But that brand of Islam was also partially assimilated into the native culture. As soon as you hit the arab\/african brand of Islam (IE, the majority of its adherents) then you also find the brutality that is native to the religion.<br><br>In just a few centuries it spread from the arabian peninsula to most of the Spain in the west and to Persia in the west, taking all the southeastern and southern mediterranean with it. The core of its territory and the one that is most relevant to us was conquered, not freely converted. The middle-east had been a bastion of antique learning, and while the arabs did translate Greek and Persian documents, it all amounted to nothing in the end. Arab philosophers were eventually weeded out by fanatical rulers and the region has since then been a cesspit of superstition and has not moved an inch in either direction.","time":1492058565,"resto":120860557,"id":"aNljlZpm","country":"SE","country_name":"Sweden"},{"no":120868157,"now":"04\/13\/17(Thu)00:43:19","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120860557\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120860557<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;invade countries with larger populations<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;&quot;i&#039;m protecting my minorites against you infidels&quot;<\/span>","filename":"1491853040354","ext":".jpg","w":1500,"h":2500,"tn_w":75,"tn_h":125,"tim":1492058599253,"time":1492058599,"md5":"96AN1T1ykBpCJDKRC181yQ==","fsize":1233922,"resto":120860557,"id":"XI84tk\/X","country":"US","m_img":1,"country_name":"United States"},{"no":120868189,"now":"04\/13\/17(Thu)00:43:42","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120868101\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120868101<\/a><br>in the east*","time":1492058622,"resto":120860557,"id":"aNljlZpm","country":"SE","country_name":"Sweden"}]},{"posts":[{"no":120868154,"now":"04\/13\/17(Thu)00:43:15","name":"Anonymous","sub":"\/pol\/ communism general","com":"Hello Comrades.

E.g. there&#039;s no inherent evolutionary plan for stronger\/faster animals, but stronger\/faster animals may be more successful in their environment. This is what Darwin refers to as &#039;survival of the fittest&#039;, which isn&#039;t related to physical fitness but how well certain things individuals fit into their environment. <br><br>The more &#039;fit&#039; the individual, the more likely it will survive and be able to produce offspring which, due to the hereditary nature of passing genes, will also be fit to their environment. After many generations, you might find an entire population stemmed from a single individual with a particular trait which allowed it to survive better than it&#039;s competitors. <br><br>An example of this is a bottleneck evolutionary model. Imagine a disease wipes out 99% of a population like a mega-plague, but by chance of particular mutations in the genome 1% is unaffected. The result is that future populations will have stemmed from this 1%, driving a particular genotype for future populations differing them from their ancestors. This is kinda what happened to cheetahs. <br><br>Another type of evolution comes from isolated populations who adapt differently to suit their environment, e.g. Darwin&#039;s finches. Due to different abundancies of food in different islands there was an adaptive change in finch beaks over time. These finches came from a single population that would have had the same beak size. Random distributions of sizes m, however, would have been grounds for natural selection whereby a finch with a marginall smaller beak may have had more success to eat beetles for example. This increased fitness and so selection may have allowed smaller beaks to prevail over larger beaks, which may have been better for eating fruit but the fruit may have not been as abundant as beetles. Over time you get birds with smaller beaks on this island.","time":1492057878,"resto":120862874,"id":"h1ZaB8Qi","country":"AU","country_name":"Australia"},{"no":120867216,"now":"04\/13\/17(Thu)00:34:37","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120866834\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120866834<\/a><br>T. a biology\/genetics major that did lots of evolution electives. <br><br>Also on phone so ignore all dem typos and shieet","time":1492058077,"resto":120862874,"id":"h1ZaB8Qi","country":"AU","country_name":"Australia"},{"no":120867261,"now":"04\/13\/17(Thu)00:34:59","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120864732\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120864732<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;it will probably become more common<\/span><br>This is where it loses me.

BMI was designed to be used as a simple means of classifying average sedentary (physically inactive) populations, with an average body composition. For these individuals, the current value recommendations are as follow: a BMI from 18.5 up to 25 kg\/m2 may indicate optimal weight, a BMI lower than 18.5 suggests the person is underweight, a number from 25 up to 30 may indicate the person is overweight, and a number from 30 upwards suggests the person is obese.[8]Some athletes, such as football linemen, have a high muscle to fat ratio and may have a BMI that is misleadingly high relative to their body fat percentage.<\/span>","time":1492058652,"resto":120865916,"id":"OEtYVMAm","country":"US","country_name":"United States"}]}]}

When whites are murdered by blacks, the media ignores it, but when blacks are murdered by whites there is outrage. Caitlyn Jenner and Chelsea Manning - two men who have chosen to change their gender with surgery, and this is encouraged too. Their universities have seen the rise of feminism, multiculturalism and cultural marxism, which has spread throughout the world like a plague.

In particular, \/pol\/, the &quot;Politically Incorrect&quot; board, has been a central figure in the outlandish 2016 US election season, as it has often been linked to the alt-right movement and its rhetoric of hate and racism. However, 4chan remains relatively unstudied by the scientific community: little is known about its user base, the content it generates, and how it affects other parts of the Web. In this paper, we start addressing this gap by analyzing \/pol\/ along several axes, using a dataset of over 8M posts we collected over two and a half months. First, we perform a general characterization, showing that \/pol\/ users are well distributed around the world and that 4chan&#039;s unique features encourage fresh discussions. We also analyze content, finding, for instance, that YouTube links and hate speech are predominant on \/pol\/. Overall, our analysis not only provides the first measurement study of \/pol\/, but also insight into online harassment and hate speech trends in social media.<\/span><br><br>https:\/\/arxiv.org\/abs\/1610.03452<br>https:\/\/arxiv.org\/pdf\/1610.03452.pd<wbr>f","filename":"11906233_1661938980737600_1330127617_n","ext":".jpg","w":480,"h":480,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":250,"tim":1490771465969,"time":1490771465,"md5":"OEuOpn+b3Pn08jwliM9QbQ==","fsize":37964,"resto":0,"id":"udLRojoq","country":"EE","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"daily-reminder-that-there-is-a-uni-research-paper","country_name":"Estonia","replies":158,"images":47,"omitted_posts":153,"omitted_images":45,"tail_size":50},{"no":118783248,"now":"03\/29\/17(Wed)08:58:31","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118764634\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118764634<\/a><br>We need to pump those numbers up <br><br>Niggers","time":1490792311,"resto":118759493,"id":"FS\/wG9N+","country":"AU","country_name":"Australia"},{"no":118784530,"now":"03\/29\/17(Wed)09:14:21","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118759710\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118759710<\/a><br>Picture absolutely relevant","filename":"1490538650812","ext":".gif","w":500,"h":281,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":70,"tim":1490793261947,"time":1490793261,"md5":"Hyim38xAafcfJN2yuTTzKA==","fsize":1019481,"resto":118759493,"id":"TwLghjd7","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":118784684,"now":"03\/29\/17(Wed)09:16:12","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118759710\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118759710<\/a><br>Fpbp and picture is relevant","filename":"NatSoc-frog","ext":".png","w":498,"h":582,"tn_w":106,"tn_h":124,"tim":1490793372864,"time":1490793372,"md5":"DQ1+Olr1G\/FBzGNk4l+g3A==","fsize":361350,"resto":118759493,"id":"TwLghjd7","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":118784848,"now":"03\/29\/17(Wed)09:18:18","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118775150\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118775150<\/a><br>i know that, that&#039;s why i said that the could&#039;ve easily put Slav and Swede (non-insulting words used almost always in insulting context)","time":1490793498,"resto":118759493,"id":"6\/+gXhSo","country":"RS","country_name":"Serbia"},{"no":118785648,"now":"03\/29\/17(Wed)09:28:01","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118764406\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118764406<\/a><br><br>China - hate vortex or proxy central?","filename":"yrOmyHR","ext":".png","w":624,"h":434,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":86,"tim":1490794081627,"time":1490794081,"md5":"jpBhfrtmpW\/wnAzq2oZvUA==","fsize":60500,"resto":118759493,"id":"KB\/H+wJ8","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"}]},{"posts":[{"no":118784935,"now":"03\/29\/17(Wed)09:19:22","name":"Anonymous","com":"Guess we\u00b4ll find out.","filename":"who-would-win","ext":".jpg","w":840,"h":782,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":232,"tim":1490793562986,"time":1490793562,"md5":"GP3XnqtbcOx4yMeFZVFztA==","fsize":330707,"resto":0,"id":"8TZgT3aY","country":"DE","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"guess-well-find-out","country_name":"Germany","replies":1,"images":0},{"no":118785642,"now":"03\/29\/17(Wed)09:27:56","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118784935\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118784935<\/a><br>Some of those bronze age stories lay the foundation of a prosperous society.<br><br>By destroying them, you are destroying the moral bedrock that our civilizations were built on.","time":1490794076,"resto":118784935,"id":"dmrOVOig","country":"US","country_name":"United States"}]},{"posts":[{"no":118773063,"now":"03\/29\/17(Wed)06:49:19","name":"Anonymous","sub":"Degenerates","com":"Who other than muslims do you guys hate. <br><br>For me, gypsies are the scum of the earth.","filename":"romfolk","ext":".jpg","w":646,"h":429,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":166,"tim":1490784559563,"time":1490784559,"md5":"x\/Xl1+QsIj9MpWOyAJwLTw==","fsize":117854,"resto":0,"id":"puEjd1PG","country":"NO","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"degenerates","country_name":"Norway","replies":86,"images":20,"omitted_posts":81,"omitted_images":18},{"no":118783194,"now":"03\/29\/17(Wed)08:57:48","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118773063\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118773063<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Russians <\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;deplorables (Trump voters, Republicans, conservatives, tea partiers, alt-right, white nationalists, etc) <\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;\/pol\/ <\/span><br><br>I hate Trump.","time":1490792268,"resto":118773063,"id":"V4edX91W","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":118783469,"now":"03\/29\/17(Wed)09:01:17","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118773063\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118773063<\/a><br>Amazing how they can be so disheveled, but when their begging shifts are over they are picked up in a big mercedes and spend their breaks talking to their fellow gypsies on iphones.

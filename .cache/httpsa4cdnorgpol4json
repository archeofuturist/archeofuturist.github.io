Keep in mind, Stalin couldn&#039;t even take Finland a couple of years before. Yes, the Soviets were reforming their army and it would have improved, but without the pressure of the German invasion it wouldn&#039;t have improved nearly as much as it did in real life (because in real life it was forced to improve). Stalin would probably would have had trouble just trying to invade Poland, and then Hitler could have moved in in the guise of being Poland&#039;s defender. The Soviet troops would have fought poorly on attack, compared to in defense of the motherland.<br>In short, Hitler made a very bad mistake in attacking Poland.

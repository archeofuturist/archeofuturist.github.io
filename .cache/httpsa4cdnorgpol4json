Most of the United states faces a harsh temperature change throughout the year that make brand new roads riddled with potholes from a single winter. This is impossible to do, that&#039;s why you see some roads that were neglected to be repaved for a few years.<br><br>3. We have a lot more cars than you do. The average american owns 2 cars and commutes on average 50 miles (80 km) back and forth everyday. This means that roads face much more abuse here than the roads in europe.<br><br>4. We drive heavier vehicles. trucks vs cars in most places in america is about 50\/50. Trucks use a more aggressive tread than cars that wear ruts into the roads and eventually potholes form.<br><br>5.

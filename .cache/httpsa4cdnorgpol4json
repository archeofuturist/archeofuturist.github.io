A mass of Latin words falls upon the facts like soft snow, blurring the outline and covering up all the details. The great enemy of clear language is insincerity. When there is a gap between one&#039;s real and one&#039;s declared aims, one turns as it were instinctively to long words and exhausted idioms, like a cuttlefish spurting out ink. In our age there is no such thing as \u2018keeping out of politics\u2019. All issues are political issues, and politics itself is a mass of lies, evasions, folly, hatred, and schizophrenia.

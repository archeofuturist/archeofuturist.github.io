It seems to be the norm in the west so you are more likely to be accepted if you are circumcised just for aesthetics alone. I like the look of cut penises better but that is just my opinion, I know there are a lot of ladies who agree with me though. I have had this conversation with my friends before and they all agree they like circumcised more based on looks.<br><br>I live in the US so I have never had sex with or seen an uncircumcised man but one of my roommates studied abroad in Portugal and she had a boyfriend there who was uncircumcised and she said he under-performed greatly, I think she just wanted to stay for his money or something lol, she got spoiled.. It makes sense that more sensitivity would lead to premature ejaculation and an unsatasfied woman. Like I guess the natural penis is meant to just spread the seed as fast as possible so it makes sense.<br><br>What I know about the performance is anecdotal but all the friends i&#039;ve had conversations with have agreed that we like the look of circumcised a lot more.<br><br>So what&#039;s the problem with it? It&#039;s a non-invasive procedure that is done at birth to normal kids. If I have a son I am going to have him circumcised just so he doesn&#039;t get made fun of by any of his future girlfriends, me and my sister had this conversation and she chose to circumcise her son for the same reason.","filename":"banana","ext":".jpg","w":1280,"h":720,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":140,"tim":1490051145552,"time":1490051145,"md5":"XYyxHU\/DTb35ifcXbKOYKw==","fsize":91134,"resto":0,"id":"Q76ZiA0e","country":"US","m_img":1,"bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"circumcision","country_name":"United States","replies":52,"images":11,"omitted_posts":47,"omitted_images":11},{"no":117551060,"now":"03\/20\/17(Mon)19:35:27","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p117550619\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;117550619<\/a><br>What was the issue and how much less do u feel now?","time":1490052927,"resto":117546750,"id":"5eCIx6L8","country":"CA","country_name":"Canada"},{"no":117551172,"now":"03\/20\/17(Mon)19:36:10","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p117550428\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;117550428<\/a><br>Tfw uncut","filename":"1173827365311","ext":".png","w":479,"h":379,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":98,"tim":1490052970618,"time":1490052970,"md5":"kWyqlyw8IIej990OX3mS7Q==","fsize":329672,"resto":117546750,"id":"06BqJpmG","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":117551369,"now":"03\/20\/17(Mon)19:37:18","name":"Anonymous","com":"being cut saves me time in the shower and makes me a good goy.","time":1490053038,"resto":117546750,"id":"s7P9m9Sz","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":117551513,"now":"03\/20\/17(Mon)19:38:15","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p117546750\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;117546750<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;So what&#039;s the problem with it? <\/span><br>Go suck some baby dicks rabbi.","filename":"246d820239f79d764191eea3b700e81659d7375e8aaf3dd7841e961f61442b1a","ext":".jpg","w":215,"h":255,"tn_w":105,"tn_h":125,"tim":1490053095031,"time":1490053095,"md5":"VmimUCt3fZZ4xfY0YfknOw==","fsize":5216,"resto":117546750,"id":"5Jz\/29SB","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":117551649,"now":"03\/20\/17(Mon)19:39:04","name":"Anonymous","com":"I couldn&#039;t pee with the age of 1 and my tip just feels like normal skin no pleasure at all","time":1490053144,"resto":117546750,"id":"5X1h\/LHr","country":"CH","country_name":"Switzerland"}]},{"posts":[{"no":117550339,"now":"03\/20\/17(Mon)19:30:16","name":"Anonymous","sub":"FBI INSIDER ON COMEY HEARING","com":"Don&#039;t ask how or why I know this but everyone needs to understand what happened today so without giving away too much here you go (I also dont give a shit if you don&#039;t believe me) ...<br><br>Comey is not in bed with the democrats or anything like that, today was purely a strategic move.

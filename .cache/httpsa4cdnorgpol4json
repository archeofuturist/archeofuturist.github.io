Which is a shame, because a lot of their racial humour used to be really on point.<br><br>I&#039;ve already had the plot spoiled for me, so I have no intention of watching something that I already know is 100% about the discomfort American blacks can feel around American whites. It&#039;s an issue that&#039;s not only remote to me, but completely laughable. I read an interview with the director, and he basically explains it like that. It&#039;s not a viewpoint I have sympathy for, given that the same feeling in white people (either in America or Europe) actually DOES very often lead to horror-movie-esque murders. So niggers feeling slightly uncomfortable in suburbia because of culture shock? Fucking deal with it, you crybabies.<br><br>Oh, and a big part of the movie&#039;s plot is the implication that *sigh* white people are somehow obsessed with black people being &quot;cool&quot; and want to appropriate that for themselves.<br><br>No, niggers, we aren&#039;t interested in your magic negro bullshit. We don&#039;t think you&#039;re special, and we know the stereotypically careless black lifestyle comes hand in hand with also not caring about important stuff, which is why you complain about &quot;racism&quot; at the same time you claim white people are &quot;stiff&quot; or &quot;boring&quot;, because those attributes also make people excell in the world.<br><br>So is it well made? I&#039;d bet my left arm that it is. Entertaining to watch, too. Does it have a persistent undercurrent of bitching about nonissues in the whole black-white racial relationship in the US? From the mouth of the director: Yes. However, as I understand it, it&#039;s mostly about white liberals.

They aren&#039;t comfortable around niggerish black people, so their show is effectively two black guys in whiteface, playing two black guys in exaggerated blackface. The show is funny but their depictions of blacks are pretty obviously derogatory. And they are both married to white women, so there&#039;s that. Basically the way I see it they represent African americans who have been whitewashed beyond the point where they are comfortable being black, like they are embarassed of the fact that they are black and try to distinguish themselves through their humor. That&#039;s probably why a lot of people on \/pol\/ can still appreciate their humor even if there is a lot of nigger culture in it.","time":1492596763,"resto":121824471,"id":"CAnki85V","country":"US","country_name":"United States"}]},{"posts":[{"no":121826070,"now":"04\/19\/17(Wed)05:36:00","name":"Anonymous","sub":"\/britpol\/ RESUGUM edition","com":"<span class=\"quote\">&gt;May running scared on TV debates (&quot;The prime minister&#039;s attempt to dodge scrutiny shows how she holds the public in contempt.&quot;- Farron)<\/span><br>http:\/\/www.bbc.co.uk\/news\/uk-politi<wbr>cs-39633696<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;More than 5000 people joining the Lib Dems a day<\/span><br>http:\/\/www.independent.co.uk\/news\/u<wbr>k\/politics\/lib-dems-gain-5000-membe<wbr>rs-general-election-tim-farron-a768<wbr>9991.html<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Lib Dems on course to WIN general election popular vote with over 50% of vote, latest poll shows<\/span><br>http:\/\/www.dailystar.co.uk\/news\/lat<wbr>est-news\/606613\/general-election-uk<wbr>-2017-daily-star-poll-liberal-democ<wbr>rats<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Lib Dems rule out Corbyn Coalition<\/span><br>https:\/\/www.ft.com\/content\/38abced6<wbr>-2437-11e7-a34a-538b4cb30025","filename":"farron","ext":".jpg","w":660,"h":371,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":140,"tim":1492594560069,"time":1492594560,"md5":"rZK8VCIZXJj47n2ljsMkyQ==","fsize":18164,"resto":0,"id":"42ngjsui","country":"GB","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"britpol-resugum-edition","country_name":"United Kingdom","replies":8,"images":0,"omitted_posts":3,"omitted_images":0},{"no":121827367,"now":"04\/19\/17(Wed)05:54:04","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121826689\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121826689<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Conservatives will dominate and have the mandate they require. <\/span><br><br>Assuming that the working class heroes that voted for Brexit actually break the habit of a lifetime and actually vote in a GE as well.<br><br>The narrative has already been set that &quot;we don&#039;t need anavah fakkin election&quot; and &quot;Da Tories will walk it they don&#039;t need you to fakkin&#039; vote, mate, watch football and get sloshed at a BBQ instead&quot; so most working class people won&#039;t vote.<br><br>It&#039;ll be a closer run thing then you think.","time":1492595644,"resto":121826070,"id":"42ngjsui","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":121827600,"now":"04\/19\/17(Wed)05:57:40","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121827367\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121827367<\/a><br>No it won&#039;t because even hardline labour don&#039;t want corbyn as pm especially not during these troubled times.

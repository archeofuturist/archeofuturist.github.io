The West is not going to wake up. No matter how many terror attacks happen, no matter how much awful culture immigrants and migrants bring into the West, people are never going to say &quot;that&#039;s enough.&quot; Most millenials in particular are victims of relentless brainwashing to turn them all into globalists, marxists loonies. And these people are going to be running the governments at some point. It&#039;s a sad reality.<br><br>If there was going to be come kind of reactionary resistance, even a peaceful, political one, it would have happened by now. Stuff like Trump and Brexit are just temporary stopgaps. It won&#039;t do much when the populace is so insanely bluepilled. Besides, most of the voters for those things tend to skew older. The world we are going to be facing in the coming decades will be ruled by globalist morons.","filename":"1476406388132","ext":".jpg","w":500,"h":521,"tn_w":239,"tn_h":250,"tim":1490233241460,"time":1490233241,"md5":"1UEmHIjURQygBGMYDY6cgQ==","fsize":138604,"resto":0,"id":"gUFZTyBr","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"the-west-is-never-going-to-wake-up","country_name":"United States","replies":13,"images":3,"omitted_posts":8,"omitted_images":1},{"no":117868475,"now":"03\/22\/17(Wed)21:57:10","name":"Anonymous","com":"Ive been thinking the same thing. Its getting harder to recognize any relationship by social contract between me and the government.<br><br>I&#039;ve gotten inured to this crap. Some loonies want to mow down, stab or blow up shit, and the fucking kikes are right there to tell us its a muslim thing, and thats why we should keep sending money to Israel and blowing up Sandlanders, the only people left who dont hesitate to expel kikes. &quot;Terrorism&quot; apparently doesnt require demands or links to actual political bodies. You just have to be muslim.<br><br>According to the left, it has nothing to do with incompatible cultures, or transplanting millions of people of any culture in so short a time. Or bringing only poor. Or that any statist party in a democracy will eventually lose accountability, fail, lose favor with voters, and so the solution is always to import new voters at the expense of the old ones.<br><br>I just dont have a lot of sympathy anymore. Will Britain let more kebabs in tomorrow? You bet. Will California and Maryland keep importing aliens? Yep. So why should I have any sympathy, until people openly say it is time to march into the street with guns, knives and fire and exterminate invaders. And when government workers with guns show up, make them pick a side. Either the fucking governments are for their citizens or they are working for the fucking enemy. Its not that goddam complicated. And if the government is not legitimized by the governed, then their laws are as worthless as their authority and they need marched towards the fucking firing squad.<br><br>A nation is not its fucking government.

During the thousand years that included the careers of the Frankish soldier and the Polish king, the Christians of Asia and Africa proved unable to wage successful war with the Moslem conquerors; and in consequence Christianity practically vanished from the two continents; and today, nobody can find in them any &quot;social values&quot; whatever, in the sense in which we use the words, so far as the sphere of Mohammedan influences are concerned. There are such &quot;social values&quot; today in Europe, America and Australia only because during those thousand years, the Christians of Europe possessed the warlike power to do what the Christians of Asia and Africa had failed to do \u2014 that is, to beat back the Moslem invader.&quot;","time":1490234217,"resto":117846654,"id":"FW6W15\/i","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":117868512,"now":"03\/22\/17(Wed)21:57:23","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p117868319\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;117868319<\/a><br>You bastard!<br><br>Now i&#039;m hungry...","time":1490234243,"resto":117846654,"id":"pwGnIgXA","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":117868622,"now":"03\/22\/17(Wed)21:58:21","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p117846837\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;117846837<\/a><br>Kill em","time":1490234301,"resto":117846654,"id":"7\/J9Hm1X","country":"US","country_name":"United States"}]},{"posts":[{"no":117849648,"now":"03\/22\/17(Wed)19:42:56","name":"Anonymous","com":"By the end of this week, 4chan will be a very different place.

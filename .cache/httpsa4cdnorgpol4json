Stephen Jay Gould has written exhaustive articles on how evolutionary science needs to involve a new terminology, alongside &quot;adaptation&quot;, called &quot;exaptation&quot;, meaning an innate characteristic that gets used for a purpose it was never originally designed for. The example is dinosaurs that became birds by growing feathers first to catch fish in streams and to keep insulated in the cold, and only by a novel, unexpected outcome of interacting with their environment to use the unintentional but possible combination of leaping through the air and using wind drag to be able to glide, then flying wasn&#039;t originally an innate DNA genetic characteristic. Look up &quot;exaptations&quot; and &quot;adaptations.&quot; <br><br>Also, I find it interesting that only a small portion of the genome creates your body, 90 percent of it is called &quot;junk&quot; dna, well the theory of exaptations, which puts biology into a less predetermined mould, comes up with a possible answer for why &quot;junk&quot; which serves no purpose is actually the central facet of evolutionary chance that means natural design has no teleos.","time":1491828801,"resto":120422458,"id":"WIaI8oWN","country":"AU","country_name":"Australia"},{"no":120435057,"now":"04\/10\/17(Mon)08:54:52","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120434751\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120434751<\/a><br>I&#039;m a NEET friendo.

This makes sense as before modern times, travel across distances like that was more or less impossible. So as Europeans were setting up society, they stopped having a need for things like dance circles and whatnot. Meanwhile, they needed things like conformation to societal norms and rules. A self imposed artificial selection of sorts. Developing a strong society and civilization is what Europeans focused on, with things like strong, permanent settlements, farming, career specialization, etc. Meanwhile the people in places like Africa and the New World (think Hispanic) didn&#039;t develop as strong societies and therefore didn&#039;t need as much conformation to societal rules. Drums and dancing remained an important aspect of their societies because it brought them together and whatnot, thereby increasing their likelihood of survival. <br><br>So the lack of focus on advancing civilizations and technologies (such as farming) kept the need for drums as an important aspect of their relatively simplistic societal structures and traditions. So those who could dance and play drums well had a better chance of survival. The focus on drums and simplistic, beating rhythms is what gave rise to the good senses of rhythm (and can be seen in modern African-American music as well). Meanwhile law breakers are bad for advanced societies as a whole. So those not willing to follow the rules of society were weeded out in Europe. <br><br>If you accept this as true, then it becomes apparent that societies that place heavy importance on drums and simplistic music and dancing are more likely to be lawless and have simplistic societies, cultures, civilizations, and technologies. <br><br>Any thoughts, pol?","filename":"warrior dance","ext":".jpg","w":1600,"h":1066,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":166,"tim":1493536015731,"time":1493536015,"md5":"M2TNMf3Ple5x5dVJMiFXlA==","fsize":388056,"resto":0,"id":"XUPC8CIg","country":"US","m_img":1,"bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"so-i-recently-came-up-with-a-social-theory-that-i","country_name":"United States","replies":42,"images":3,"omitted_posts":37,"omitted_images":3},{"no":123459813,"now":"04\/30\/17(Sun)05:14:50","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123449813\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123449813<\/a><br>OK.

The link between societal structure and willingness to break laws. I think that this one is less polarizing. It makes more sense too. If your people evolved in a society without much in the way of rules or regulations, then you would be less inclined to follow rules and laws in general. Now, whether or not the increased crime rate with these peoples can be attributed in at least some part to nature over nurture can be hard to determine. The impact of ones rearing can&#039;t be overstated, but the amount of crime in majority minority areas of developed countries (and by that I mean ghettos in the US and the like where minorities are the most common demographic) as well as in the countries that they hail from (South America and Africa) give a good indication that there is at least some amount of criminality which can be attributed to the nature of those people. Again, these are vague generalizations for the purpose of evolutionary and sociological theories. Of course not every S American or African or African-American commits many crimes, but the trend is apparent. <br><br>The obvious next step in evaluating this aspect of the theory would be to somehow evaluate the crime rates of minorities that were raised in environments which exactly matched that of a control, white group. The only way that I could see that being possible is to look at black and white adoptees of affluent white parents. And I highly doubt that there is a study or statistics which we could find about that to really investigate. And that wuold be ignoring the impact that society as a whole would have on those individuals.","time":1493544133,"resto":123449813,"id":"XUPC8CIg","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":123460685,"now":"04\/30\/17(Sun)05:28:19","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123459547\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123459547<\/a><br>I think that I have finally managed to explain at least this aspect of my theory sufficiently, as you seem to understand it the same as I do now.

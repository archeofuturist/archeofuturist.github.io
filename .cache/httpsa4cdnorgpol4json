I contributed a lot to canada, and I would not want to that shithole of a country ever again.","filename":"853c69a442b48cfc2cbf7de8210e04b7","ext":".jpg","w":236,"h":185,"tn_w":236,"tn_h":185,"tim":1490235218920,"time":1490235218,"md5":"8F5B5wXMbfuTJajLbFnv4w==","fsize":9880,"resto":0,"id":"4MZVa+QF","country":"CA","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"want-me-to-go","country_name":"Canada","replies":99,"images":6,"omitted_posts":94,"omitted_images":5},{"no":117890110,"now":"03\/23\/17(Thu)00:57:31","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p117889470\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;117889470<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;CHP is collecting all of the seculars<\/span><br>yes, i don&#039;t doubt that, but to win an election, you need a majority. they need to actively spread secularism and as you said they need to get people to lose their islamic roots. but granted, it is not easy to do when you are up against radical islam isn&#039;t it?","time":1490245051,"resto":117870633,"id":"4MZVa+QF","country":"CA","country_name":"Canada"},{"no":117890384,"now":"03\/23\/17(Thu)00:59:51","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p117889470\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;117889470<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt; nothing to be afraid of if you were a common citizen and they were<\/span><br>yeah, they were afraid of another coup, and it happened. luckily it went well and created a short period of peace. the thing is,you cant really predict when or how a coup will happen, and they had no way of knowing without it actually happening.","time":1490245191,"resto":117870633,"id":"4MZVa+QF","country":"CA","country_name":"Canada"},{"no":117891035,"now":"03\/23\/17(Thu)01:06:09","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p117890110\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;117890110<\/a><br>no, to form a government you need a majority. we had that majority after june 7. akp couldn&#039;t form one.

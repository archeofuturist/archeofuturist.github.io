We have a serious problem. Overpopulation and dysgenics. Removing the negro, south asian and mongoloid menace would reduce the strain on the world, its ecosystem, and its many variables like pollution, limited resources and whatnot. By at least 85%<br><br>So thats a huge wildfire that wont be linked to its neighboring wildfires. Reducing the chance of all life on earth perishing, to which its heading right now.<br><br>So its pretty moral to kill the negro, south asian, south east asain and mongoloid. They are also pretty useless for civilisation stuff, for anything really. They can be seen as part of the wildlife. So yea, it&#039;s moral to exterminate them all","filename":"IMG_2902","ext":".png","w":2048,"h":1536,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":93,"tim":1490066021067,"time":1490066021,"md5":"j64SfCNHp0zlI6qq8LgMWw==","fsize":3156552,"resto":117569709,"id":"x9IIC7Q9","country":"IL","m_img":1,"country_name":"Israel"}]},{"posts":[{"no":117566735,"now":"03\/20\/17(Mon)21:31:21","name":"Anonymous","sub":"Christianity","com":"Hey \/pol\/, how do I get past the fact that Christianity is cucked?

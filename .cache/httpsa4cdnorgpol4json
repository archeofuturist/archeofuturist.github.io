He expressed a profound distaste for the entire matter and said that he hoped we would never hear of it again -- it had been a hasty and difficult issue, principally because of the difficulty of explaining away the film and the statements of the American fliers. However, the vote had been favorable and he hoped that this was the end of the matter for him. He had no desire to raise the subject again himself, but said that he would probably call upon us for additional material if and when the matter should arise in the future.<br><br>My bump, is this of any use?

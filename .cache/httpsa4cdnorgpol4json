It&#039;s people benefit from socialized healthcare and free education though civil rights aren&#039;t super great. By and large, it&#039;s a fairly secular country and quite conservative too. Radfeminism seems non existent as is Jewry and the country is strictly non interventionist.it&#039;s army is the largest and best funded in all of Africa with large stocks of the newest Russian equipment such as s-300s and a fuckton of t-90s. One of the few clients Russia trusts with its latest gen shit.<br><br>A cool place but still very poor by western standards. Also, its pretty hard to get into for non citizens. Algerians are proud people and they don&#039;t much appreciate western tourists though they welcome foreigners doing business, they&#039;re not allowed to own majority stakes in companies or properties.<br><br>Pretty based but not without its issues. A weak puppet president, an economy completely reliant on oil, high youth unemployment.<br><br>If you speak french and have the patience to get the Visa (which is long af for a non slav white), I suggest visiting. The mountains are just beautiful and so is old Algiers. Also, traditional food is based.<br><br>Hope that covers everything Swedebro.","time":1493169625,"resto":122814959,"id":"ku2tf19e","country":"CA","country_name":"Canada"},{"no":122821140,"now":"04\/25\/17(Tue)21:26:26","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122820228\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122820228<\/a><br>Dont listen to m\u00e9dia nothing is happening","filename":"image","ext":".jpg","w":3264,"h":2448,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":93,"tim":1493169986813,"time":1493169986,"md5":"DzvDj1LnnWoLj0bfdeiGVw==","fsize":2144336,"resto":122814959,"id":"zZPHWjIC","country":"DZ","m_img":1,"country_name":"Algeria"},{"no":122821482,"now":"04\/25\/17(Tue)21:29:04","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122821140\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122821140<\/a><br>I know.

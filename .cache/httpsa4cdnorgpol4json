Rep. Mark Pocan (D-Wis.) is introducing the same measure in the House.<br><br>The Obama administration issued federal guidance last year stating that Title IX of the 1972 Education Amendments protected students from discrimination based on gender identity, rather than just gender alone. It also ensured students access to the restrooms and other facilities consistent with their gender identity. <br><br>The Trump administration issued new guidelines in February withdrawing the Obama-era guidelines, arguing that issue was best handled at the state level.","filename":"TylerClementi","ext":".jpg","w":800,"h":600,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":187,"tim":1493340230978,"time":1493340230,"md5":"c\/Ply\/E0C77ggBNZD76Mag==","fsize":106557,"resto":0,"id":"6H98Frk6","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"democrats-propose-tyler-clementi-act-to-support","country_name":"United States","replies":0,"images":0}]},{"posts":[{"no":123090050,"now":"04\/27\/17(Thu)17:20:49","name":"Anonymous","sub":"Post who you voted for and your IQ","com":"<span class=\"quote\">&gt;Trump <\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;95<\/span>","filename":"images (3)","ext":".jpg","w":206,"h":244,"tn_w":206,"tn_h":244,"tim":1493328049404,"time":1493328049,"md5":"\/PPB2g8JOA4dnrHuCdLaQg==","fsize":9402,"resto":0,"id":"a7iTiAb0","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"post-who-you-voted-for-and-your-iq","country_name":"United States","replies":237,"images":50,"omitted_posts":232,"omitted_images":49,"tail_size":50},{"no":123117829,"now":"04\/27\/17(Thu)20:38:05","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123090050\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123090050<\/a><br>Trump 125","time":1493339885,"resto":123090050,"id":"c4FjEOtF","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":123118033,"now":"04\/27\/17(Thu)20:39:51","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123090050\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123090050<\/a><br><a href=\"#p123090140\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123090140<\/a><br>try again next time","time":1493339991,"resto":123090050,"id":"s1x263sC","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":123118036,"now":"04\/27\/17(Thu)20:39:52","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123090050\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123090050<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;voting<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;believing things will change<\/span><br>topcuck","time":1493339992,"resto":123090050,"id":"gphOsEd3","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":123118362,"now":"04\/27\/17(Thu)20:42:43","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123117470\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123117470<\/a><br>what are you doing on pol mrs.

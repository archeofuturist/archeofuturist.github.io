I would caution against intermingling the notion of free will with &quot;every day&quot; sort of things, for the lack of a better term, such as Peter&#039;s decision to deny Christ with the ability to be delivered from sin and death. Peter&#039;s proclamation of Jesus being the Christ, the Son of God was explicitly stated by Jesus to be given to Peter from God the Father alone. The Lutheran and Reform doctrine of predestination was about how man is saved, not about whether or not he can choose to do or not do things like betray a friend or lie.","time":1492523010,"resto":121668834,"id":"3mBhRtxD","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":121685939,"now":"04\/18\/17(Tue)09:43:52","name":"Anonymous","filename":"christ-221x300","ext":".jpg","w":221,"h":300,"tn_w":92,"tn_h":125,"tim":1492523032177,"time":1492523032,"md5":"J0qner0y0BkWhLrHHNdDHA==","fsize":33842,"resto":121668834,"id":"lkje1XNe","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"}]},{"posts":[{"no":121685639,"now":"04\/18\/17(Tue)09:40:54","name":"Anonymous","com":"Why don&#039;t we dump degenerate refugees and niggers in the DPRK?<br>They won&#039;t say no to more slaves.","filename":"1492420354762","ext":".jpg","w":670,"h":906,"tn_w":184,"tn_h":250,"tim":1492522854958,"time":1492522854,"md5":"TLF2kBQNvER\/8N+dNX64uA==","fsize":87344,"resto":0,"id":"20dRsu0z","country":"AU","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"why-dont-we-dump-degenerate-refugees-and-niggers","country_name":"Australia","replies":1,"images":0},{"no":121685935,"now":"04\/18\/17(Tue)09:43:49","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121685639\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121685639<\/a><br>Why not, the Koreans need food.","time":1492523029,"resto":121685639,"id":"UTn5RCSR","country":"US","country_name":"United States"}]},{"posts":[{"no":121681506,"now":"04\/18\/17(Tue)08:57:15","name":"Anonymous","sub":"Fuck off ya cunt","com":"This chat is for hard strayin&#039; fucks only ya cunts.

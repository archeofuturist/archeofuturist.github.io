Either neck yourself or change yourself, either way, you have and the rest of humanity has to live with your descision.","time":1491709725,"resto":120231188,"id":"orq7\/+wt","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":120233431,"now":"04\/08\/17(Sat)23:53:31","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120232216\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120232216<\/a><br>Letting your family name die out is dishonorable.","time":1491710011,"resto":120231188,"id":"M8Ua73dO","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":120234048,"now":"04\/08\/17(Sat)23:58:36","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120233431\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120233431<\/a><br>Yeah I know.

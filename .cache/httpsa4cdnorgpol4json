He offers targeted platitudes to create a devoted audience. He understands the bank of ideas that make up the pro-white\/nationalist\/1488 belief system, and uses that knowledge to market himself to you.<br>His speeches are feel-good leftist style nonsense. He spouts vague generalizations about history to make you feel good about yourself, while not actually educating you on the history. He neither isolates any problems nor offers legislative solutions to them. He HURTS any cause he attaches him self to by reducing it to a banal motivational speech with no substance. He is the equivalent of the people who jack off to &#039;classical art&#039; but can&#039;t name the paintings or artists they spam. <br>Spencer&#039;s arguments are nothing but appeals to emotion. There is no difference between what he says and &quot;diversity is our strength why can&#039;t we all just get along xD&quot;.<br><br>He&#039;s not a problem because he&#039;s a shill for pro-Israel, or pro-Homosexuality, he&#039;s a problem because he is anti-intellectual that masquerades as a poignant speaker, while offering no true knowledge to his audience, just affirming their already-held beliefs and garnering praise for himself for doing so. In a different situation, Spencer would happily be an extreme leftist speaker, if he thought it would secure him the audience and income being an extreme right wing speaker has.

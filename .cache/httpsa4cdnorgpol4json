We still need to decide what the factory will make, how much to charge for that thing, how much to pay the workers. Some people will still need to stand bent over a machine for 12 hours and some people will still need to have fancy lunch with clients - and we need to decide which is which.<br><br>So this is the point at which communism works in theory. If all the workers who seized the factory are well-meaning and clever and figure out which are the best products to sell and then divide the work and the money fairly, then communism works and everyone is happy. In theory. In practice, some people are sneaky and unfair and will try to get most money for least work. Some people are loud mouths and will insist the factory make some stupid product nobody will buy. Some people are dumb and can&#039;t do their work properly, even if they wanted to.","time":1490852355,"resto":118888707,"id":"iBDeMW9l","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":118889477,"now":"03\/30\/17(Thu)01:40:20","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118888707\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118888707<\/a><br>Humans are greedy by nature.","time":1490852420,"resto":118888707,"id":"jyCRaSHM","country":"NZ","country_name":"New Zealand"},{"no":118889808,"now":"03\/30\/17(Thu)01:43:38","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118888707\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118888707<\/a><br>It&#039;s anti-Christianity.","filename":"gun-nun","ext":".png","w":1600,"h":1200,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":93,"tim":1490852618351,"time":1490852618,"md5":"SEjd2I+pe7rnaCuiHFlGnw==","fsize":1103693,"resto":118888707,"id":"uLPXZu9K","country":"US","m_img":1,"country_name":"United States"}]},{"posts":[{"no":118881228,"now":"03\/30\/17(Thu)00:16:00","name":"Anonymous","sub":"The biggest redpill","com":"This one isn&#039;t easy to take, and it may sound weird at first, but eventually you&#039;ll understand.

Greater Israel. And greater Israel can&#039;t happen until it&#039;s running from the Nile to the Euphrates.<br><br>This won&#039;t be the last strike Trump does on Syria, but the next one might cost him a few ships from what I hear. The one after that will cost him jets and potentially a base. The one after that will cost him Israel, and that will be the beginning of Armageddon.<br><br>Trump will not carry out further attacks for a while, but will support terrorists more than even Obama did. He will also support Kurdish terrorists because Israel needs a second state beyond the Euphrates that is allied with it. These Kurdish terrorists will be killing Christians in Syria and Iraq but Trump and the media will remain silent.<br><br>All of this is going to accelerate to a crescendo until 2020, the final year of Trump&#039;s first term and around the election when Trump will carry out the final attacks.

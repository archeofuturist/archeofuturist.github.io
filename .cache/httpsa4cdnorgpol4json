My liberal friends keep hammering me with this dossier shit when it comes up and I can&#039;t come up with answers.<br><br>Conservatives say the Steele dossier is fake and written on \/pol\/, which definitely sounds like something they would do. Liberals say &quot;proven&quot; elements of it couldn&#039;t be written by trolls and that Russians wouldn&#039;t have been murdered and arrested for providing the info if it was all fake.<br><br>Also I&#039;m aware of the actual troll excerpts on \/pol\/ about anime porn movies or some shit which isn&#039;t actually in the dossier, because I actually read the whole fucking when I thought it actually said that. The worst claim is just the prostitute peeing on Obama&#039;s bed thing, not even that he drank it like \/pol\/ keeps memeing. So really who even cares if some hookers peed on a bed.<br><br>That aside, I&#039;ve scoured the internet for information about elements like Kalugin, and it seems more likely that the dossier was correct on that guy. We know there was some dumb misinformation campaign, and this guy supposedly worked with it, and they pulled him out when they were afraid we&#039;d find out. As good as \/pol\/ may be they aren&#039;t going to have classified info about Russian operatives to put in a troll book.<br><br>There was in fact a source for the dossier that Steele mentioned by name who was murdered in Russia after it leaked. There was in fact several government workers who were arrested for treason (reported in RT). So if nothing else, whoever leaked the thing is responsible for those deaths. Nobody talks about that. Maybe McCain is the first to blame. Possibly even Flynn depending on what you read.<br><br>So what the fuck am I supposed to think? How can you counter shilling to this degree? I get tired of looking like the idiot for voting for this guy when I&#039;ve got nothing but &quot;lol \/pol\/ did it&quot; and changing the subject.","filename":"1488832718833","ext":".jpg","w":761,"h":540,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":177,"tim":1491275107628,"time":1491275107,"md5":"4QCTRCfk1WI8Rc7xtbHc5A==","fsize":250327,"resto":0,"id":"CtaOslEA","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"memes-aside-im-having-a-hard-time-with-this-lads","country_name":"United States","replies":67,"images":11,"omitted_posts":62,"omitted_images":10},{"no":119435393,"now":"04\/04\/17(Tue)01:23:33","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119434455\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119434455<\/a><br><br>that&#039;s.. not an elaboration at all.","time":1491283413,"resto":119422145,"id":"8IEkPVeH","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":119435574,"now":"04\/04\/17(Tue)01:25:48","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119433526\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119433526<\/a><br><a href=\"#p119433557\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119433557<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;sees black box censor<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;lol that means the actual dox have a black box too<\/span>","time":1491283548,"resto":119422145,"id":"5MFJTz9S","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":119435658,"now":"04\/04\/17(Tue)01:26:40","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119434225\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119434225<\/a><br><br>what kind of downsyndrome mindset is this? it&#039;s LITERALLY &quot;Innocent until proven guilty&quot; but you think the piss dossier contains 100% real facts until you find proof otherwise? check this out<br><br>Sources say the date is 4\/4\/2017, Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders are literally Hitler.<br><br>Prove it wrong or it&#039;s 100% fact and true.

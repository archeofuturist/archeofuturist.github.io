[...] this particular one, a shelf mushroom, jutted at knee height from the trunk of the largest hemlock in Knight&#039;s camp. He began observing the mushroom when its cap was no bigger than a watch face. It grew unhurriedly, wearing a Santa&#039;s hat of snow all winter, and eventually, after decades, expanded to the size of a dinner plate, striated with black and gray bands. The mushroom meant something to him; one of the few concerns Knight had after his arrest was that the police officers who&#039;d tromped through his camp had knocked it down. When he learned that the mushroom was still there, he was pleased.&quot;<\/span><br><br>__________<br><br>On Knight&#039;s fame<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;&quot;Hundreds of journalists, across the United States and the world, attempted to contact him.

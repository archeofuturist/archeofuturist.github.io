However, unlike the previous generation, they were never taught the fundamental rules of the internet, primarily: you should never reveal private info. Normies think that the internet is a giant playground where you make friends and share cool pictures and deep philosophical thoughts. But anyone who&#039;s been using the internet since the 1990&#039;s and\/or is knowledgeable in tech, knows that the internet is not some child-friendly place. For fuck&#039;s sake, a third of the internet is straight up porn (probably half if you include girls&#039; Facebook pics). Doxxing someone is easy as hell because their entire lives are online. What I&#039;m trying to say is that this place was never meant for normies, because they don&#039;t understand the ramifications of their actions online. I think the internet is actually a detriment to normies because they take everything seriously and literally (as if it is real life). They were never taught that this place is separate from their everyday lives and ought to remain that way.","filename":"fantasy and reality","ext":".jpg","w":1277,"h":849,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":166,"tim":1493329455924,"time":1493329455,"md5":"T+D4\/VFaeKQ7pgvAEcni0A==","fsize":891556,"resto":0,"id":"20uJaEYe","country":"US","m_img":1,"bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"the-internet-and-its-effects-on-society","country_name":"United States","replies":0,"images":0}]},{"posts":[{"no":123092978,"now":"04\/27\/17(Thu)17:40:05","name":"Anonymous","sub":"Ivanka Trump","com":"<span class=\"quote\">&gt;tfw everything we worked so hard for was destroyed by her.<\/span><br><br>Was there any right choice in the elections?","filename":"ivankatrump-trumptowerdubaiparty-vettrinet-wallpaper-f71b2200e4bcf0ae6aabb1478c99a030-large-254289","ext":".jpg","w":1440,"h":2124,"tn_w":169,"tn_h":249,"tim":1493329205711,"time":1493329205,"md5":"OEAMqxk7t+1cYFJ+4X64HQ==","fsize":671290,"resto":0,"id":"YGR8ebi6","country":"US","m_img":1,"bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"ivanka-trump","country_name":"United States","replies":3,"images":2},{"no":123093149,"now":"04\/27\/17(Thu)17:41:20","name":"Anonymous","filename":"you should have listened","ext":".jpg","w":300,"h":300,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":125,"tim":1493329280145,"time":1493329280,"md5":"lh73bGTMRfV6PSW7oB3CuA==","fsize":11597,"resto":123092978,"id":"JBeLtTJa","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":123093443,"now":"04\/27\/17(Thu)17:43:12","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123092978\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123092978<\/a><br>Time to dig up stuff on her and her cuck husband.","filename":"snake around heart","ext":".jpg","w":640,"h":640,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":125,"tim":1493329392865,"time":1493329392,"md5":"5J+Q1HeZXA3hs9FmOdzL1A==","fsize":128823,"resto":123092978,"id":"pGJxe2Oi","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":123093604,"now":"04\/27\/17(Thu)17:44:16","name":"Anonymous","com":"(((elections)))","time":1493329456,"resto":123092978,"id":"2n2owQvV","country":"DK","country_name":"Denmark"}]},{"posts":[{"no":123092469,"now":"04\/27\/17(Thu)17:36:59","name":"Anonymous","sub":"&quot;Well you&#039;re just a bigot, anon.&quot;","com":"Well \/pol\/, it fucking happened.<br><br>My sister says there are more than two genders.<br>I told her I wasn&#039;t gonna learn knew pronouns or any shit like that like that one tentacle monster in Futurama.<br><br>In turn she called me a bigot.<br><br>She seems to have forgotten but how can I slam some facts on her?","filename":"1493154867433","ext":".jpg","w":400,"h":400,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":250,"tim":1493329019231,"time":1493329019,"md5":"ZHBcVqhF42ily\/OiNM1HmQ==","fsize":24930,"resto":0,"id":"Ux\/4\/gVG","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"well-youre-just-a-bigot-anon","country_name":"United States","replies":6,"images":0,"omitted_posts":1,"omitted_images":0},{"no":123093150,"now":"04\/27\/17(Thu)17:41:20","name":"Anonymous","com":"<span class=\"quote\">&gt;I slam<\/span><br>There&#039;s your answer friend.","time":1493329280,"resto":123092469,"id":"YLyKe5\/m","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":123093267,"now":"04\/27\/17(Thu)17:42:06","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123092469\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123092469<\/a><br><br>Wonder how many primary colors are in her universe.","time":1493329326,"resto":123092469,"id":"c2caN5Bx","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":123093304,"now":"04\/27\/17(Thu)17:42:22","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123092831\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123092831<\/a><br>Fpbp","time":1493329342,"resto":123092469,"id":"4DdHbVsJ","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":123093371,"now":"04\/27\/17(Thu)17:42:45","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123092469\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123092469<\/a><br>Ask her about male-to-rapesexual.","time":1493329365,"resto":123092469,"id":"qWfkqRLE","country":"RU","country_name":"Russian Federation"},{"no":123093607,"now":"04\/27\/17(Thu)17:44:16","name":"Anonymous","com":"I mean, gender dysphoria exists.

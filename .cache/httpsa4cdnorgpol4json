I often start by mentioning the 6 hour long attack by the Israeli Airforce and Navy on the USS Liberty in the 1960s that led to 34 American Deaths and nearly 200 injured.

Europe much like South East Asia has always been in competition against its neighboring nations. A moment of power is an excuse to take action against a previous transgression. Otto Von Bismark was able to justify his outreach as unifying people of a common ethnicity, heritage and language. Similar to Putin&#039;s excuse for taking back Crimea. <br><br>Beyond that though, the taking of land that exceeded what would be reasonable claims of unifying Germanic people, was indeed excessive and ultimately the ensuing cause of its fall. Kaiser Wilhelm II and Hitler looked beyond the unification of Germanic people and exceeded the desire to benefit them. As I said before, settling old scores were a primary motivator and an eventual damnation. Taking France was payback for WWI. <br><br>The excuse for expansion was often called the need for &quot;Growing room&quot; though that is difficult to achieve in Europe where there is no unclaimed clay and the ability to expand is only possible by the end of a rifle or spear.","time":1491370121,"resto":119556683,"id":"P\/8LiCvC","country":"US","country_name":"United States"}]},{"posts":[{"no":119555640,"now":"04\/04\/17(Tue)22:44:07","name":"Anonymous","sub":"Breaking: Jared Kushner Is Leaking To MSNBC","com":"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=yAa<wbr>p1rM0Dq4","filename":"rekt","ext":".jpg","w":1190,"h":595,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":125,"tim":1491360247410,"time":1491360247,"md5":"JMKjDNop+UPsCxg8xpOyzg==","fsize":114790,"resto":0,"id":"2I63SW0Y","country":"US","m_img":1,"bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"breaking-jared-kushner-is-leaking-to-msnbc","country_name":"United States","replies":76,"images":16,"omitted_posts":71,"omitted_images":14},{"no":119571624,"now":"04\/05\/17(Wed)01:23:58","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119570978\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119570978<\/a><br><br>\/pol\/ OFFICIALLY ANTI-KUSHNER NOW <br><br>This is how we filter the shills <br><br>Pro-Bannon, Anti-Kushner, Ivanka&#039;s on notice, Pro-Donald Jr. <br><br>Trump better kick this climber to the curve, or wind up like Nixon.","filename":"f4546d28b6234eb1ffca3cc572cd3b74015128dab428e89090af129d274001b7","ext":".jpg","w":255,"h":193,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":94,"tim":1491369838652,"time":1491369838,"md5":"a6hQzmt+SfTmMhMKoAsmog==","fsize":9472,"resto":119555640,"id":"9chepAlJ","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":119571731,"now":"04\/05\/17(Wed)01:25:10","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119555640\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119555640<\/a><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;elect trump<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;puts jew son in law in charge of everything<\/span><br><br>save me pol","time":1491369910,"resto":119555640,"id":"AruaqUv0","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":119571806,"now":"04\/05\/17(Wed)01:26:05","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119571475\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119571475<\/a><br>He or his family have ties to a lot of people.

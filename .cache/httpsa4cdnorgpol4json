To see whether this all comes down to lower incomes, Kanetha Wilson and her colleagues at Vanderbilt University in Nashville, Tennessee, compared the health of high-earning African Americans with that of non-Hispanic white people on similar salaries.<br><br>The team analysed data collected between 2000 and 2011 from more than 2500 people who earned $175,000 in 2000 \u2013 more than four times the average salary for that year. \u201cWe found that black people still had more health disadvantages compared to white people,\u201d says Wilson. \u201cThey had greater odds of having hypertension, lower mental health and obesity.\u201d<br><br>Wilson thinks that part of the problem may be the enduring racism that African Americans continue to experience in everyday life. \u201cAs a black woman, I know that just because you\u2019re on a high income, doesn\u2019t mean that people won\u2019t treat you differently,\u201d she says.<br><br>Chronic exposure to such \u201cmicro-aggressions\u201d is known to cause stress and mental health problems. Such microagressions often take the form of subtle putdowns, and can make individuals feel undervalued, criminal or foreign. But structural racism is also problematic, writes Zinzi Bailey at the New York City Department of Health and Mental Hygiene and her colleagues in a separate study.<br><br>Bailey\u2019s team has reviewed all the studies on racial discrimination and its effects on health in the US published between 2000 and 2016. They found that segregation still exists and is endangering lives.

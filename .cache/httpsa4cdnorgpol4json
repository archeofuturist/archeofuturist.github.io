Depression hit me like a truck when I hit 20, and for the past six years I&#039;ve been in an existential funk flowing between one job to the next and being in and out of college trying to find something worth doing. I want to go down fighting. I&#039;m tired of squeaking by day to day. I don&#039;t want to go out with a whimper, I want to stand up and yell, I WANT MY LIFE TO MEAN SOMETHING. Where people can actively change the world, where government can and will be limited. No more spying on people, no more forcing itself into your daily lives. A world where senators and house reps will say &quot;Man maybe we do need term limits on ourselves and we should quit gerrymandering districts too while we&#039;re at it.&quot; I want people to act like they have some goddamn common sense and quit running around with pink hair and a dildo in their pocket. I was an eagle scout for fuck&#039;s sake and here I am lamenting how my country is falling apart. The worst part is I know, I know, you know, we all know, we can&#039;t do anything since we&#039;re little people. In studying history I&#039;ve figured that out. It&#039;s broken, it&#039;s going to be broken, it&#039;s always going to be broken, but goddammit we shouldn&#039;t just let it stay that way, it wouldn&#039;t hurt to try to fix things for the better. My depression is something I can&#039;t put my finger on, it&#039;s a lethargy, it&#039;s this energy draining weight that keeps me sedated. I take my soma and it only helps a little bit, enough to get up for work, but it&#039;s just not enough. I don&#039;t know what to do and this ranting and rambling is just making these feelings even more exacerbated. Helplessness. I was brought up thinking that you can take care of everything on your own, and coming up into adulthood I&#039;ve realized that while I can care for myself, the world is far beyond what an individual can fix.","filename":"john goodman loses his shit","ext":".gif","w":240,"h":180,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":93,"tim":1493243806344,"time":1493243806,"md5":"OoB9avbmB06JOInM2mHyTw==","fsize":2991833,"resto":122937017,"id":"\/AEdlkmS","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":122945957,"now":"04\/26\/17(Wed)17:56:56","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122944543\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122944543<\/a><br>I almost certainly do, agreed on that.<br><br>I&#039;ve never actually listened to Dr. Sort-Yourself-Out.

He has to go out of town for a 2 day training. The gov is filling empty Selective Service Board seats that have not been filled for decades. Draft is coming. <br><br>Here&#039;s a definition of the local board:<br>A Selective Service local board is a group of five citizen volunteers appointed by the Director of Selective Service on behalf of the President, based on recommendations made by their respective state governors or an equivalent public official.. These men and women play an important community role closely connected with our nation&#039;s defense. If a military draft becomes necessary, approximately 2,000 local boards throughout the United States, territories, and the District of Columbia would decide who among the registrants in their community will receive deferments, postponements, or exemption from military service based on the individual registrant&#039;s circumstances and beliefs.&quot;<br><br>Today this post was made by another user:<br><br>&quot;I have been volunteering as a board member of the SSS for over ten years. All correspondence up until today has been with the State Director and\/or the RFO (Reserve Force Officer). The military handles the administration of the Selective Service System UNTIL it becomes activated. At that point, a civilian administrator takes charge.<br><br>Today, I received an email from the Operations Manager of the Selective Service System for our region asking to confirm contact information. Not typical! Is this system gearing up?<br><br>I believe there is an effort to include women in the draft in the 2017 NDAA. I volunteered to serve but never hoped to have it go hot.

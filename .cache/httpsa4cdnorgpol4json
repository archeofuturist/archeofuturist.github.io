The party is not represented in any legislative body in the Czech Republic and its biggest electoral success so far has been a gain of 1,14% in the Czech legislative election in 2010. Some of the high-ranking party officials, including a Prague party leader, have been associated with neo-nazi groups such as N\u00e1rodn\u00ed odpor, Czech subsidiary of international militant neo-nazi group.[2][3] In spring 2009 the petition for the ban of the party was dismissed by the Czech Supreme Administrative Court,[4] because, as the presiding judge stated, the applicant (Czech government) didn&#039;t manage to provide sufficient evidence in what was seen as a botched application.[5][6] Following violent attacks against Czech minorities by far-right extremists[7] (such as V\u00edtkov arson attack of 2009), the government filed a more detailed petition for the ban, which was discussed by the Czech Supreme Court in January and February 2010. The party was banned, making it the first instance of banning a party for its ideology in the modern history of the Czech Republic.[8] The party was transformed into a &quot;Party of Citizens of the Czech Republic&quot;[9] and the party was renamed to Workers&#039; Party of Social Justice.

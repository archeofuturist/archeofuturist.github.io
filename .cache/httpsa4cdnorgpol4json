I meant European as an identity, of course we have European genetics.

Don&#039;t debate me on &#039;which are whites and which are not,&#039; this can be decided at an individual basis through this institution. Also from this institution all other relevant institutions of civilization must be able to spring, as our own banks, schools, companies, laws, community centers, etc. If all whites were part of such an institution, our own distinct ethnic group would continue to manifest itself without interference or degeneration (as in without too many whites race mixing our)<br><br>The only institution capable of such a burden over an indefinite period of time is an ETHNO-RELIGION. This is the only way.

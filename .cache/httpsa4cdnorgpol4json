After a long day at work, she should be the one who&#039;s there for you with a plate of hot, nice food. The kind of woman that offers to put bandaid on a minor scratch on your calves. Note that this doesn&#039;t mean that she&#039;s 100% submissive, I&#039;m all for taking an off day from work as a &quot;father&#039;s day&quot; to stay home and look after the kids while your wife works one day in the week. <br><br>Thirdly, the chemistry needs to be there. Most of the boys on here recommend finding a Christian, submissive girl, but frankly those are in most cases boring as all hell.

No person on the planet can truly lie without showing signs. Something interesting to look at for example is, take her to her parents, and observe how she treats her family.

So that they can easily rule over your consciousness. Don&#039;t forget real authority starts there. The rest is detail. Pornography, nudity, obscene dress, alcohol, they all serve to this agenda. They portray pornography and fapping as if it were harmless while in reality they cause many serious psychological problems starting with low self-esteem, social anxiety disorder and depression. They corrupt your psyche. You already know it because you are no-faps. But quitting fap is not enough. You must also quit being sexually obsessed in your mind. Stop looking at naked women on the street, work place and elsewhere. I know its hard as a man, but everytime you find yourself captivated by their bodies, just remember that you are in the middle of a corruption process that will in the end be bad for you. But what can you do in a society where everything visual revolves around naked bodies and lust? Spirituality is the only answer my friends. Not dark-Satanic versions of course. They only make things worse for you. I myself found true spirituality in Sufism. It worked on me. You can start with googling &quot;Rumi poetry&quot;. You don&#039;t have to become a Muslim to be a Sufi. Maybe later you might consider, but this is irrelevant because Sufism is about your soul.

There is not time for that. This book is a warning. The world is not sliding, but galloping into a new transnational dystopia. This development has not been properly recognized outside of national security circles. It has been hidden by secrecy, complexity and scale. The internet, our greatest tool of emancipation, has been transformed into the most dangerous facilitator of totalitarianism we have ever seen. The internet is a threat to human civilization. These transformations have come about silently, because those who know what is going on work in the global surveillance industry and have no incentives to speak out. Left to its own trajectory, within a few years, global civilization will be a postmodern surveillance dystopia, from which escape for all but the most skilled individuals will be impossible. In fact, we may already be there.<\/span><br>While many writers have considered what the internet means for global civilization, they are wrong. They are wrong because they do not have the sense of perspective that direct experience brings. They are wrong because they have never met the enemy.

I know it&#039;s shit. But no matter how shitty it is, it&#039;s nothing that an independent sense of self-worth and autonomy can&#039;t fix. Here&#039;s what I mean:<br><br>You are in control of your own life. You get to decide what you do every hour of every day. Some of you have fallen into debt traps and educational black holes, lured by the promise of more money down the line. Now that you understand that that was a lie (or at best, an exaggeration), you can move on and start your life over.<br><br>Every single thing you do has an affect on your life. If you spend most of your time working a job you hate, you will be less happy. If you spend time bitching about things which are out of your control, you will be less happy and remain unfulfilled.<br><br>However, if you recognize that you are the author of your life - not in the superficial sense, but in a very literal sense - you can do whatever you want. You can do good, you can do evil. You can be an asshole, you can be a gentleman. You can be a shut-in who pursues his obsessions. You can be a volunteer or an inventor. Society, as shitty as it is and as infested as it is with degenerates and idiots and primitive cultures, still provides you with all the means to pursue the things you care about. <br><br>In conclusion: it is absolutely inexcusable for a healthy white male - which are natural problem solvers - to feel &quot;beaten down&quot; by all the emotional, primitive, socialist bullshit going on around him. A real man finds a way. <br><br>Stop bitching, faggots.","filename":"bobt","ext":".jpg","w":1400,"h":732,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":130,"tim":1493685596444,"time":1493685596,"md5":"47XRoxdfs3TC4soc8vEkBw==","fsize":49069,"resto":0,"id":"tVkusKBt","country":"CA","m_img":1,"bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"stop-bitching-and-live-your-life","country_name":"Canada","replies":6,"images":1,"omitted_posts":1,"omitted_images":0},{"no":123699701,"now":"05\/01\/17(Mon)20:42:20","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123699425\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123699425<\/a><br><br>That&#039;s easy for you to say because you&#039;re A FUCKING WHITE MALE","time":1493685740,"resto":123699425,"id":"ILISDXyt","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":123699841,"now":"05\/01\/17(Mon)20:43:38","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123699701\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123699701<\/a><br><br>What disposition are you?","time":1493685818,"resto":123699425,"id":"tVkusKBt","country":"CA","country_name":"Canada"},{"no":123700577,"now":"05\/01\/17(Mon)20:49:39","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123699425\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123699425<\/a><br>Society is so competitive from overpopulation now that if you&#039;re a runt in just one respect you get thrown by the wayside","time":1493686179,"resto":123699425,"id":"LHCOBsgi","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":123701483,"now":"05\/01\/17(Mon)20:56:53","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123699841\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123699841<\/a><br><br>A white male","time":1493686613,"resto":123699425,"id":"ILISDXyt","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":123701664,"now":"05\/01\/17(Mon)20:58:24","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123701483\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123701483<\/a><br><br>So tell me, how in the world do you feel that society is so shit that you can&#039;t even function?<br><br>You have total control over your own life.","time":1493686704,"resto":123699425,"id":"tVkusKBt","country":"CA","country_name":"Canada"}]},{"posts":[{"no":123690818,"now":"05\/01\/17(Mon)19:28:21","name":"Anonymous","sub":"State Debate","com":"ITT: Discuss which is the best state in the United States of America.<br><br>Say why, debate and give stories.","filename":"IMG_1173","ext":".gif","w":1100,"h":704,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":160,"tim":1493681301804,"time":1493681301,"md5":"mGn5aF4f\/KRSQSOQ\/W7M\/Q==","fsize":196072,"resto":0,"id":"WEJ4GRx9","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"state-debate","country_name":"United States","replies":66,"images":11,"omitted_posts":61,"omitted_images":11},{"no":123700610,"now":"05\/01\/17(Mon)20:49:56","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123692329\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123692329<\/a><br><br>PA Fag here and I agree friend","time":1493686196,"resto":123690818,"id":"k+gb6QEW","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":123701010,"now":"05\/01\/17(Mon)20:52:58","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123698945\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123698945<\/a><br>Love it.","time":1493686378,"resto":123690818,"id":"Zgf\/wnec","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":123701053,"now":"05\/01\/17(Mon)20:53:19","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123697929\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123697929<\/a><br>I&#039;ll give you low cost of living, but the downside that comes along with that is nonwhites.

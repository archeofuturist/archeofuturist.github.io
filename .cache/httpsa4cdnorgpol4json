God exists but now what?","com":"After my edgy atheist phase during my teen days I got interested in learning all I can about religion. Im not baptized even though my parents believe in God, but they always thought that I should get baptized knowing what it implies and actually really believing in the faith. That&#039;s why this past half year in particular I&#039;ve dedicated myself to learn and study more about theology and all the scientific evidence that we have available that would lead us to believe that there is in fact a God, and I must say that despite what most of those edgy atheists (that I once was) say, there&#039;s a lot of evidence that can suggest this. After that I tried to learn the story of Jesus and after watching things like Jim Caviezel&#039;s testimony and The Pasion of Christ, and reading some books and articles from that matter, I&#039;ve never been so moved by the force and attraction that JC gives me. Almost like a heavenly force. This added to the fact that there is a clear agenda to demonize christianity gives even more reason to believe that this is the Truth. But after having christianity as a middle ground to study more about this I&#039;ve been getting confused lately about this inside fight between what I guess are anabaptists like Pastor Steven Anderson (from which I&#039;ve seen some of his sermons and movies like Marching to Zion) who claim that churches are not in the bible and that you get saved through faith alone and not through works, and those who believe that the church is the body of Christ and you should confess your sins to the priest and do good deeds. The confusing part is that both claims that the Bible backs all of their points, but for example Steven Anderson says that the only true version of the Bible is the King James version. If anyone can enlighten me I would greately appreciate it.<br><br>The idea is to discuss this in the most unbiased way possible.<br>Thanks","filename":"1b6142e668daeb4188bef76a849fdc45ace5870b9b9702700b945b5f19b2acc7","ext":".jpg","w":457,"h":546,"tn_w":209,"tn_h":250,"tim":1493691341138,"time":1493691341,"md5":"maRWk0s0mRo3HfdHZ+B99g==","fsize":52402,"resto":0,"id":"KQH1uHsR","country":"AR","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"so-i-finally-came-up-to-my-senses-god-exists-but","country_name":"Argentina","replies":53,"images":27,"omitted_posts":48,"omitted_images":27},{"no":123726803,"now":"05\/02\/17(Tue)00:33:31","name":"Anonymous","com":"In Christ is Paul&#039;s way of saying the Church.","filename":"7ab38ff4113b23701c855a2a38f16f88","ext":".jpg","w":795,"h":1300,"tn_w":76,"tn_h":125,"tim":1493699611258,"time":1493699611,"md5":"y55ktMH7r1lgxV8nklGAGQ==","fsize":214834,"resto":123711076,"id":"qNR+Swgj","country":"US","m_img":1,"country_name":"United States"},{"no":123726999,"now":"05\/02\/17(Tue)00:35:14","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123726667\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123726667<\/a><br>Personal experience from all over the flat eathers.","filename":"1481478843566","ext":".jpg","w":809,"h":710,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":109,"tim":1493699714251,"time":1493699714,"md5":"0sUi\/4tEgMSMYLEfNufLsA==","fsize":194097,"resto":123711076,"id":"qNR+Swgj","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":123728892,"now":"05\/02\/17(Tue)00:53:37","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123726803\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123726803<\/a><br><a href=\"#p123726637\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123726637<\/a><br><br>Colossians 1:24 kjv<br>Who now rejoice in my sufferings for you, and fill up that which is behind of the afflictions of Christ in my flesh for his body&#039;s sake, which is the church:<br><br>Common English Bible<br>Now I\u2019m happy to be suffering for you.

Traits like albinoism or gigantism show up in the genepool 99% of them are retards with low chances of survival much less breeding but the 1% actually grows a trait that makes them better suited to their environment so they have more kids on average than the regular member of the species. Repeat this over thousands of years with new traits popping up now and again while new physical stresses of the environment happening like volcanoes erupting or forests burning down causing migrations and population segmentation and you get many different potentially new genes getting worked into the population at the same time. Now stretch that over millions of years and eventually those gene patterns will become so divergent from each other that animals with the same common ancestor will be unable to breed, but since you have survival of the fittest constantly weeding out the 99% of useless gene malformations, the new populations that emerge are stable and suited to their environments.<br><br>Its sound. It has no social implications. No one can use this idea to get ahead politically unless fuckers like you decide that observable science needs to be opposed and the objective progress of humanity along with it because big ideas that take longer than a human lifetime to come to fruition are scary and make you feel small.","time":1493700195,"resto":123717369,"id":"NJxC40\/b","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":123728780,"now":"05\/02\/17(Tue)00:52:26","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123720981\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123720981<\/a><br>We have not yet seen 1 species gradually forming another species, we only see changes using existing traits already found within a creature. <br><br>You will never be able to breed a fish with legs for example, but you can breed a fish to get bigger fins. <br><br>How then is evolution real?

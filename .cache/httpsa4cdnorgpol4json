The Old Covenant has elements of God&#039;s Law but much was given to the people because of their character at the time (Jesus says in response to one instance of this, that it was done because the men&#039;s &quot;their hearts were hard&quot;). The New Covenant (Christianity) fulfilled the role of the Old Covenant so to make way for God&#039;s Law in full. This is why Christianity retains elements of the Old Testament teaching while dismissing many parts of it and adding new things into it.<br><br>For better explaining this in detail, I find the early church theologians very skilled at separating the distinction between retained\/not retained teaching. Please excuse me for appealing to just classic theologians rather than something authoritative:<br><br><br>Basically it&#039;s the Old Covenant teachings can be separated fields: Civil Law, Ceremonial Law, and Moral Law. The Civil and Ceremonial Law are removed in the fulfillment of the Old Covenant and the New Covenant pretty much only retains and greatly expands on the Moral Law element of it. Leviticus is pretty much staunchly the Civil Law and - to put it more bluntly - the Levitical priesthood is dismissed outright in St. Paul&#039;s Letter to the Hebrews, Chapter 7 so it&#039;s inconsistent to support it.<br><br>The Ten Commandments are kept by the church because they almost exclusively a good summary of moral laws (besides the sabbath, arguably, but that&#039;s still nice too).","filename":"Quote Merton","ext":".jpg","w":850,"h":400,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":58,"tim":1491685141921,"time":1491685141,"md5":"MoSNqs0D0u7XpFQjzueHxw==","fsize":75760,"resto":120158886,"id":"Pw9\/mR3i","country":"US","trip":"!!tuOwy1ct2dy","country_name":"United States"}]},{"posts":[{"no":120173028,"now":"04\/08\/17(Sat)15:44:15","name":"Anonymous","sub":"Why, of all rich nations, is America virtually the only one with a serious obesity crisis?","filename":"1491285507317","ext":".webm","w":1280,"h":720,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":140,"tim":1491680655586,"time":1491680655,"md5":"CeGhQtIeqLZVh8k4cZCi6A==","fsize":1533198,"resto":0,"id":"QF85jxdY","country":"IN","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"why-of-all-rich-nations-is-america-virtually-the","country_name":"India","replies":85,"images":18,"omitted_posts":80,"omitted_images":18},{"no":120181167,"now":"04\/08\/17(Sat)16:52:11","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120178977\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120178977<\/a><br>The problem is the subsidies only exist because the agribusiness guys lobby the shit out of congress. <br><br>Sometimes I wish our government wasn&#039;t run on bribery.","time":1491684731,"resto":120173028,"id":"g3X6lwfI","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":120181497,"now":"04\/08\/17(Sat)16:55:00","name":"Anonymous","filename":"Asylum Demon training grounds","ext":".webm","w":720,"h":404,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":70,"tim":1491684900729,"time":1491684900,"md5":"cdVPj1\/J\/nyJnQi9n3qNnw==","fsize":3027695,"resto":120173028,"id":"5OG5lQw9","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":120181670,"now":"04\/08\/17(Sat)16:56:41","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120181497\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120181497<\/a>","filename":"1489023288892","ext":".jpg","w":960,"h":952,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":123,"tim":1491685001240,"time":1491685001,"md5":"D5EYP71RiGZyyuWANba7Lg==","fsize":41718,"resto":120173028,"id":"lY\/ZuUvU","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":120181750,"now":"04\/08\/17(Sat)16:57:26","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120174129\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120174129<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;The camera quakes at it thunders towards you<\/span>","time":1491685046,"resto":120173028,"id":"nu0sG+sN","country":"CA","country_name":"Canada"},{"no":120181932,"now":"04\/08\/17(Sat)16:58:59","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120177767\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120177767<\/a><br>Further question for you since you just dropped some KNAWLEDGE.

In any case, they garner tens of thousands, if not hundreds of thousands of views and many people get swayed by Hitler the same way the German people did 70 years ago.

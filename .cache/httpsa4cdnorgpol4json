And my point was just about how what you said doesn&#039;t result in acceptation of people, because I can tell you France makes LOTS of effort for assimilating muslims and they just don&#039;t want to. They are given load of things, there are big efforts for a national cohesion, they get education, living standards, they&#039;re exposed to other cultures, and they hate us. <br><br>This is more profound than you believe. Islam isn&#039;t adapted to western values, it&#039;s a theocratic political ideology that is about supremacy. It is not compatible with our culture and it is the root of the problems in the middle east. It is a cult that holds on the past and reject everything that&#039;s not muslim. And what makes you particularly angry, is that you are told you are the people chosen by allah and at the same time you see the success of the west while the muslim world is poot for most of its parts. This is this jealousy that makes most muslims hate the west. I know you&#039;re probably not like that, but a lot of muslims seem to have a complex of inferiority that makes them angry. Even you seem to have it in some way as you tell us to fix the root of the problem as if you&#039;re incapable of your own destiny.<br>Don&#039;t get me wrong, in any way I support this violence happening in your country and I hope the best for you and your people.","time":1491693239,"resto":120175135,"id":"upNBCWJz","country":"FR","country_name":"France"}]},{"posts":[{"no":120183973,"now":"04\/08\/17(Sat)17:16:38","name":"Anonymous","com":"QUICK<br><br>RATE DONALD TRUMP&#039;S PRESIDENCY WITH A REACTION IMAGE","filename":"1477519002721","ext":".jpg","w":499,"h":499,"tn_w":249,"tn_h":249,"tim":1491686198822,"time":1491686198,"md5":"8UWRolnDPfXRJFdGN2EzBg==","fsize":36799,"resto":0,"id":"vaYEykb0","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"quick","country_name":"United States","replies":197,"images":162,"omitted_posts":192,"omitted_images":158,"tail_size":50},{"no":120198606,"now":"04\/08\/17(Sat)19:12:41","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120183973\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120183973<\/a>","filename":"pol in a nutshell","ext":".jpg","w":450,"h":300,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":83,"tim":1491693161866,"time":1491693161,"md5":"4Bw0cf9SwB97i9SMyay2LQ==","fsize":37346,"resto":120183973,"id":"Qsrh2uTC","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":120198609,"now":"04\/08\/17(Sat)19:12:42","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120183973\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120183973<\/a>","filename":"1491667628521","ext":".png","w":680,"h":881,"tn_w":96,"tn_h":125,"tim":1491693162607,"time":1491693162,"md5":"rtVSwacInaM28Fy4w6gGhg==","fsize":1089372,"resto":120183973,"id":"IfOLl7qO","country":"SE","country_name":"Sweden"},{"no":120198727,"now":"04\/08\/17(Sat)19:13:38","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120197891\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120197891<\/a><br><br>hillsdawg at least had diplomatic experience and a team of professionals around her with similar experience. trump has a military. this shit only had one direction to go in and you fags didn&#039;t realize it.","time":1491693218,"resto":120183973,"id":"V9XYhQ9B","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":120198756,"now":"04\/08\/17(Sat)19:13:56","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120187939\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120187939<\/a><br>even Milo is starting to doubt El Trumpo","time":1491693236,"resto":120183973,"id":"IfOLl7qO","country":"SE","country_name":"Sweden"},{"no":120198759,"now":"04\/08\/17(Sat)19:13:53","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120183973\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120183973<\/a>","filename":"image","ext":".png","w":515,"h":1253,"tn_w":51,"tn_h":125,"tim":1491693233069,"time":1491693233,"md5":"smsmq1X5qcJvOH9XymRNIw==","fsize":318203,"resto":120183973,"id":"+LOftACA","country":"US","country_name":"United States"}]},{"posts":[{"no":120192318,"now":"04\/08\/17(Sat)18:22:51","name":"Anonymous","sub":"How is this even possible?!","com":"There was a post on David Icke forum in 2007 saying Kushner was the leader of a secret cabal and would assume leadership through a puppet after the next President (Obama).

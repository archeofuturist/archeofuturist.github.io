Worried about the \/pol\/ movement. Worried that it may be failing. And I need reassurance. Reassurance that we&#039;re still on the right track, doing the right thing as a collective.<br><br>Trump hasn&#039;t done much to justify his presidency in the eyes of his opposition and his supporters. After his inauguration, he has made far too many mistakes. This is in stark contrast to his performance during the Republican primary and the general election, where he could do no wrong. I fear the same for other elections in Europe, in countries like France, like Germany, and others.<br><br>The question here is: after you elect them. What next? What exactly do they do? And how do they go about achieving that goal? \/pol\/ seems to be uncertain what Trump should do while in office, what immediate problems he must tackle, and how. And that uncertainty could prove to be his undoing, our undoing. The meme magic that got him elected is waning, and its influence on Europe is weakening. The left has already gained back some lost ground. Should the incumbent in the European countries notice this weakness and attack it, they may well stay in power, and our work will ultimately be for naught. If we&#039;re not careful enough, even the United Kingdom may end up lost, isolated, cut off, when Brexit is complete.<br><br>So \/pol\/, decide on a direction, here and now. What exactly do we want to achieve? What is our purpose? And most importantly, what immediate actions do we have to take to help achieve that means? &quot;Make X great again&quot; sounds nice and all, but it&#039;s far too vague to sustain the magic.<br><br>If we have strayed, may we get back on the right track, and ultimately achieve greatness.

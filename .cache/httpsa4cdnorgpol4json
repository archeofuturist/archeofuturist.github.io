Anarchists hold that capitalism and the state are inextricably linked and that to get rid of one you need to get rid of the other, they therefore advocate the immediate abolition of the state and the transferal of power to democratic unions or councils, alonside the abolition of private property, meaning that anarchists support the democratic control of resources by the community.

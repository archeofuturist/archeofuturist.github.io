I started with the Greeks and made it about to Hegel before I had to quit philosophy forever because I was going to sleep every night with a glass of bourbon on my bedstand just in case I woke up wanting to shoot myself. I read Lenin&#039;s pedantic explanations for why establishing his totalitarian dictatorship was an essential step in the move towards the abolition of the State, and definitely not just a way to keep him well supplied with roast beef and suckling pig.<br><br>You know who I haven&#039;t read? Hoppe. Friedman. Sowell. Hayek. I sure as fuck have never read Rand. I don&#039;t bother exposing myself to right-wing ideology because it&#039;s all self evident. I&#039;ve never had to have a right wing idea explained to me more than once for it to make perfect sense, but I had to read the entire amazon fucking rainforest to come to even the beginnings of understanding the appeal of Communism. I had to broaden my horizons to such an absurd degree that even when I shut it off I don&#039;t think democracy is a good idea anymore. My brain is like the floppiest roastie cunt ever battered by BBC on a black sofa, except old bearded Germans were the ones fucking me instead of niggers.<br><br>I&#039;ve read Marx, you little faggot. Oh my stars and garters have i read fucking Marx, and it was the most colossal waste of my time I&#039;ve ever indulged in. Never have I read a more content-free volume than the Communist Manifesto. Das Kapital was at least informative.","filename":"tumblr_mqiq02EWy11rlt6ymo1_1280","ext":".jpg","w":1280,"h":914,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":89,"tim":1491270937064,"time":1491270937,"md5":"Q280xDJHpAweNcyVUg+Vig==","fsize":404835,"resto":119401959,"id":"\/b0k2RJ5","country":"CA","m_img":1,"country_name":"Canada"},{"no":119414858,"now":"04\/03\/17(Mon)21:58:30","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119414404\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119414404<\/a><br>I&#039;m not saying all taxes should go to the state I&#039;m saying pay what you owe <br>And people that take shortcuts by banking outside of other countries does not support the country","time":1491271110,"resto":119401959,"id":"0BphTS6y","country":"US","country_name":"United States"}]},{"posts":[{"no":119401760,"now":"04\/03\/17(Mon)20:03:11","name":"Anonymous","com":"WHAT IS WRONG WITH PEOPLE?!!?!?<br>Today I went to the Piggly Wiggly and while at the checkout I dropped a $20 bill... the lady in front of me picked it up...

In electrics, Germany offered companies like Siemens under Werner von Siemens and Emil Rathenau\u2019s General Electric Company or Allegemeine Elektricitats-Gesellschaft or AEG. In chemical, Germany showed its scientific skills and led the production of potassium salt, dyes, pharmaceutical products, and synthetics. It led to rise of agricultural produce, thanks to its increasing production of fertilizers. Germany also controlled 90% of dye production worldwide. Companies like Bayer and Hoescht led the chemical industry of Germany. Germany also beame a leader in automobile. First cars were made in Germany. Daimler and Benz became the most popular brands of automobile in Germany and the world.<\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Factors that led to Germany\u2019s boom in the Second Industrial Revolution included its education and government support. Germany imposed new high tariffs against imports and protected local industries and allowed them to flourish. It also stated government subsidies towards businesses. But education played a key role. For decades Prussia and many German States invested in education. Technical schools produced great minds and inventors. Eventually, by the time of the Second Industrial Revolution, Germany had a huge supply of talented and skilled population.<\/span>","filename":"986379604[1]","ext":".jpg","w":540,"h":270,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":62,"tim":1491271077701,"time":1491271077,"md5":"mtanyouLM8iZ438KDCXUEg==","fsize":32041,"resto":119404971,"id":"ftUaOBjR","country":"US","country_name":"United States"}]}]}

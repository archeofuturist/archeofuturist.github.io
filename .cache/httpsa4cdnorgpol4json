Lung cancer typically manifests after age 40, and due to cannabis becoming popular relatively recently, there are fewer regular marijuana smokers than tobacco smokers that have reached that age. (Hippies were a fringe movement, while tobacco was ridiculously widespread until recently.) Of those that have, most also smoked tobacco regularly, which is a confounding variable in any study. We have found, however, that the smoke in a typical joint\/blunt\/whatever you stoners call them these days contains more tar and far more carcinogens than a similar amount of cigarette smoke. (This is not to say that marijuana is necessarily more carcinogenic. Tobacco contains nicotine, which widens blood vessels and may make it easier for carcinogens to travel through the body.)<br><br>So to anyone who says that smoking cannabis is safe, I say only that you&#039;re retarded for thinking that, as even though a direct connection to lung disease has yet to be made, all of the prerequisites for it are there.<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;hurr but what if I vape? *tips fedora*<\/span><br>You&#039;re still an idiot.

When Hitler came to power, there where 7 million unemployed Germans, in just a year, he has reduced it to 30,000. And no, this wasn&#039;t because of militarization, Hitler found great ways of creating new jobs for the volk of Germany, such as the creation of affordable cars so that more and more needed to be produced, which would give almost all German families a affordable vehicle, and a huge space for car manufacturing. He also created massive work forces, which did great things, from planting trees to motorway construction.<br>National Socialist Germany became the poorest country in Europe to the RICHEST in just a few years.","filename":"NatSocAwakening","ext":".jpg","w":564,"h":752,"tn_w":187,"tn_h":250,"tim":1490893030292,"time":1490893030,"md5":"1q1mc5ZhmxgEvr5TYG79jQ==","fsize":52971,"resto":0,"id":"zh3qM2\/p","country":"GB","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"myths-surrounding-national-socialism-and-the","country_name":"United Kingdom","replies":48,"images":12,"omitted_posts":43,"omitted_images":11},{"no":118951841,"now":"03\/30\/17(Thu)14:46:41","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118951351\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118951351<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Demo<wbr>cratic-Republican_Party<\/span><br><br>I&#039;m not sure that such an old party and it&#039;s thinking would work, although the idea has some merit.","time":1490899601,"resto":118940094,"id":"w2gJZswC","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":118952007,"now":"03\/30\/17(Thu)14:48:08","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118940094\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118940094<\/a><br>https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=2To<wbr>JFB4WJ48","filename":"remember","ext":".jpg","w":404,"h":538,"tn_w":93,"tn_h":125,"tim":1490899688285,"time":1490899688,"md5":"Czk41p8iPrrJsXRGjbvxjQ==","fsize":25061,"resto":118940094,"id":"5ViLW4rF","country":"CL","country_name":"Chile"},{"no":118952184,"now":"03\/30\/17(Thu)14:49:53","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118942919\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118942919<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Doesn&#039;t know about the history of Prussian Germanics and the German lands Poland was reforged out of.<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Doesn&#039;t know the persecution of German people in Poland that Hitler went to the league of nations to protest.<\/span><br><br>Fuck off faggot and learn some more history.","time":1490899793,"resto":118940094,"id":"7jlTlD3y","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":118952302,"now":"03\/30\/17(Thu)14:51:05","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118951790\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118951790<\/a><br>Common good is only for your own good when workers define what it means.

Lucifer is a latin term meaning &quot;bringer of light&quot; or &quot;the morning star&quot;. Jesus himself refers to himself as &quot;the bright and morning star&quot;, and early Christian hymns refer to Jesus as Lucifer for this reason. Thus, some Luciferians, in their own way, believe they are the true Christians. Christ himself valued freedom, knowledge, and self-actualization. He labeled himself &quot;The Truth&quot;, and that we should all work to find him.<br><br>Now, I did hear an interesting theory on Kek today in regards to revelations.

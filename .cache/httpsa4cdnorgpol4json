Im sad Im like this, its like a lobotomy, and I keep fixating on issues to the point where Ive secured nothing long term in my life, because I never had a plan in that respect. The idea of building a family, or a career has come late to me, a bit too late infact.<br> I also worked with adults with severe autism, and realised it was a catch-all term for non-verbal people who were enigmas. their range of behaviours had little in common with each other. One talked endlessly, but it was never about anything relative, or even making sense. where as another didn&#039;t speak at all, but could be forced to write, and was very intelligent when he did so, citing his interest was french politics. He died of a massive seizure though, and none of us were ever able to understand what he must have felt like on the inside. Unfortunately I also feel the pandering of women staff and psychology has too much pity, and the austics are relieved of any sense of personal responsibility or character judgement, but believe me, much their behavour came from years of pandering which made them imagine themselves to be the centre of the universe. when they were mad, they thought nothing of punching people in the face, yet somehow never hit anybody that might hit them back, but we had to treat them like they had suddenly had a tragic outburst of uncontrolled illness, and fawn over the behavior afterwards, giving them more attention. I ended up hating them.","time":1490789523,"resto":118754158,"id":"NEpI+jgg","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"}]},{"posts":[{"no":118772786,"now":"03\/29\/17(Wed)06:44:33","name":"Anonymous","sub":"Fear of a BLACKE&#039;D Planet?","com":"http:\/\/www.vdare.com\/posts\/african-<wbr>overpopulation-is-your-fault-becaus<wbr>e-climate-change","filename":"mAPdCFQ[2]","ext":".jpg","w":1920,"h":1080,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":140,"tim":1490784273034,"time":1490784273,"md5":"5Assjmlw2o\/niItLjiGREw==","fsize":345576,"resto":0,"id":"TtrKwtHr","country":"US","m_img":1,"bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"fear-of-a-blacked-planet","country_name":"United States","replies":5,"images":1},{"no":118774456,"now":"03\/29\/17(Wed)07:09:54","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118772786\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118772786<\/a>","time":1490785794,"resto":118772786,"id":"TtrKwtHr","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":118776456,"now":"03\/29\/17(Wed)07:38:53","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118774456\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118774456<\/a>","time":1490787533,"resto":118772786,"id":"TtrKwtHr","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":118778522,"now":"03\/29\/17(Wed)08:02:38","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118776456\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118776456<\/a>","time":1490788958,"resto":118772786,"id":"TtrKwtHr","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":118779270,"now":"03\/29\/17(Wed)08:11:52","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118772786\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118772786<\/a><br><br>Not giving u clicks fag","time":1490789512,"resto":118772786,"id":"D6fEWlEK","country":"MM","country_name":"Myanmar"},{"no":118779282,"now":"03\/29\/17(Wed)08:12:03","name":"Anonymous","com":"If climate change really set in they would die from dehydration","filename":"IMG_4119","ext":".jpg","w":597,"h":832,"tn_w":89,"tn_h":125,"tim":1490789523532,"time":1490789523,"md5":"NOautZu5\/nIdfxJ1PL1zIA==","fsize":378568,"resto":118772786,"id":"8g6wUtMo","country":"SE","country_name":"Sweden"}]},{"posts":[{"no":118772083,"now":"03\/29\/17(Wed)06:33:56","name":"Anonymous","com":"Is there literally ANYWHERE I can go to find out about what&#039;s going on in the world that doesn&#039;t have ANY ulterior motives to influence me and will just present me with objective facts?","filename":"kP4Yax1","ext":".png","w":960,"h":742,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":193,"tim":1490783636235,"time":1490783636,"md5":"kwYP3QU1kIJfktnemcbaSw==","fsize":577577,"resto":0,"id":"TtxlK68c","country":"GB","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"is-there-literally-anywhere-i-can-go-to-find-out","country_name":"United Kingdom","replies":29,"images":8,"omitted_posts":24,"omitted_images":8},{"no":118778520,"now":"03\/29\/17(Wed)08:02:36","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118772083\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118772083<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Is there literally ANYWHERE I can go to find out about what&#039;s going on in the world that doesn&#039;t have ANY ulterior motives to influence me and will just present me with objective facts?<\/span><br>Everything is written by humans or robots built by humans, so of course not.

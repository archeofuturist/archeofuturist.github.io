If an economy grows, supposedly everyone will benefit. This idea is sometimes disparaged as \u201ctrickle down economics,\u201d because the benefits of growth are supposed to trickle down from the rich to the poor.

Rising incomes cause the price of land and resources to rise, because they are in fixed supply. So, economic growth causes resource owners to \u201cgrow rich in their sleep\u201d as John Stuart Mill once put it.

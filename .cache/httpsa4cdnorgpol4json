The transition from Judaism to Christianity is the transformation of reconnection - the healing force of love and compassion (that&#039;s why Christianity is all about Heart).<br><br>But the Jews are people of the earthly plane, and thus must be met here. If one believes the stories about Christ, that would be why Christ would need to come to the Jews - because being able to return to God is the very thing the Jews don&#039;t yet know how to do (thus their feeling of being separate from everything in life, and their focus on earthly successes).<br><br>So the rest of us would need to bring through the compassion of Christ as we act with the Jews here on earth. Which of course is exactly the way the Messiah returns for Christians, too: through everyone living with the unconditional love and forgiveness and compassion of Christ for everyone and all Life.","time":1492055885,"resto":120852141,"id":"TjDh1Bnl","country":"US","country_name":"United States"}]},{"posts":[{"no":120857918,"now":"04\/12\/17(Wed)23:06:05","name":"Anonymous","sub":"fuck donald trump. putin is my president","com":"i only voted for trump because putin wanted me to. that was the only reason. and now that trump has backstabbed putin, trump can suck my dick<br><br>I AWAIT YOUR ORDERS, EMPEROR PUTIN","filename":"vozhd","ext":".jpg","w":290,"h":174,"tn_w":249,"tn_h":150,"tim":1492052765427,"time":1492052765,"md5":"tRvN6tw+nIwUA7InI16EzQ==","fsize":6901,"resto":0,"id":"fupy8q1n","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"fuck-donald-trump-putin-is-my-president","country_name":"United States","replies":28,"images":8,"omitted_posts":23,"omitted_images":6},{"no":120862441,"now":"04\/12\/17(Wed)23:48:56","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120862094\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120862094<\/a>","filename":"108496499","ext":".jpg","w":698,"h":1024,"tn_w":85,"tn_h":125,"tim":1492055336198,"time":1492055336,"md5":"9xTEquwwJCQ2cqMvLMji1w==","fsize":385116,"resto":120857918,"id":"VVjyrKNA","country":"PE","country_name":"Peru"},{"no":120862641,"now":"04\/12\/17(Wed)23:50:53","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120861456\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120861456<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;won the cold war.<\/span><br>you know it wasnt an actual war right?","time":1492055453,"resto":120857918,"id":"MCq\/4G5p","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":120862663,"now":"04\/12\/17(Wed)23:51:05","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120857918\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120857918<\/a>","filename":"1492032616377","ext":".jpg","w":801,"h":572,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":89,"tim":1492055465895,"time":1492055465,"md5":"6lDH1psRWBdWgmrjuMjbiw==","fsize":114914,"resto":120857918,"id":"led3xoxX","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":120862668,"now":"04\/12\/17(Wed)23:51:06","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120862441\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120862441<\/a><br>putin could still wig out and totally judo flip that dude in the face if he wanted to. that&#039;s what i call REAL ULTIMATE POWER!","time":1492055466,"resto":120857918,"id":"fupy8q1n","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":120863384,"now":"04\/12\/17(Wed)23:58:02","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120862668\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120862668<\/a><br>that what i call 15 years of Kremlin brigade trying to convience you the guy is a badass.

Alliances will not be taken lightly thus, meaning some current agreements may require reconsideration in regards to the risk and reward factor that it poses the state. The state will also resist the attempts of any foreign power, ally or not, to influence the internal politics or society of the nation. Continued attempts at the influence of the nation from a foreign power will eventually lead to economic sanctions or potentially the severing of diplomatic ties until operations cease and an official apology is issued. Due to the isolationist stance, an overwhelming military like that of the current United States will not be necessary, though the nation will never disarm or leave itself weak in contrast to neighbors or other powerful spheres of influence.

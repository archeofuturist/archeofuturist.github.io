I am a depressive, I became of depressive quite young at 9 years old. The reason was, my mom had cancer, and at the time my mom and dad were divorced. I didn&#039;t like my dad at the time, he was sometimes quite cruel (He&#039;s different now). But I felt like if my mom died I would have no one. I live in a place with a national health service, the doctors saved my mother&#039;s life both during her first and second diagnoses. To this day I take depression medication covered by the national health insurance. If the health care was privatized I and my mother would probably be dead. So why in hell would I, or anyone, want to support a system that kills people off because they weren&#039;t lucky enough to be born rich. And I don&#039;t want to hear about &quot;well it&#039;s not capitalism it&#039;s corporatism&quot; Capitalism is still a market, it is still privatized. So if you think you can just sit there and spout some bullshit and hoping you&#039;ll just get rich once this capitalism comes around, you are living a pipe dream. And you know what, Cuba has done more for people like my mother and me than any capitalist country, despite people calling it a terrible communist dictatorship. Their nationalized medical research has developed four cancer vaccines, and they aren&#039;t doing it for money.

This general is for the discussion of Marxism-Leninism, the ideology of revolutionary socialism and communism.<br><br>Communism is the next stage of humanity following the capitalist stage.<br><br>What exactly is communism according to Marxist-Leninists:<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Communism is a stage of society in which the productive infrastructure is socially owned, and goods are produced not in order to sell for profit, but in order to meet a social need.<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Communism in it&#039;s full form is a stateless, classless society that follows the maxim &quot;From each according to their ability, to each according to their need.&quot;<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;To achieve such a society Marxism-Leninism teaches us that we must replace the capitalist state, which is controlled by the capitalist class, by a socialist state, which is controlled by the working class. Then, a period of class struggle follows in which the capitalist class is liquidated by the working class. When the capitalist class has been completely vanquished, there will be only one class, the working class, and eventually the functions of the state will become indistinguishable from the functions of the society as a whole, and the state as such will &#039;wither away&#039; as Marx said.<\/span><br>https:\/\/www.marxists.org\/archive\/ma<wbr>rx\/works\/1847\/11\/prin-com.htm<br>https:\/\/www.marxists.org\/archive\/ma<wbr>rx\/works\/1848\/communist-manifesto\/<br><br>ML uses a philosophy called dialectical materialism, see here:<br>https:\/\/www.marxists.org\/reference\/<wbr>archive\/stalin\/works\/1938\/09.htm<br><br>It is recommended that you read some of the critical works of Marxism-Leninism so you can make an informed assessment of the ideology.<br><br>Resources:<br>https:\/\/www.marxists.org\/archive\/ma<wbr>rx\/works\/sw\/<br>https:\/\/www.marxists.org\/archive\/le<wbr>nin\/works\/sw\/<br>https:\/\/www.marxists.org\/reference\/<wbr>archive\/stalin\/works\/decades-index.<wbr>htm<br>https:\/\/www.marxists.org\/reference\/<wbr>archive\/mao\/selected-works\/<br>https:\/\/www.marxists.org\/archive\/ma<wbr>rx\/works\/1884\/origin-family\/<br>https:\/\/www.marxists.org\/archive\/le<wbr>nin\/works\/1914\/mar\/11.htm","filename":"1481244074852","ext":".png","w":1010,"h":1010,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":250,"tim":1490464744153,"time":1490464744,"md5":"676S1nirnOI5InkeibSxFw==","fsize":177742,"resto":0,"id":"21AocZja","country":"ES","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"communism-general","country_name":"Spain","replies":170,"images":55,"omitted_posts":165,"omitted_images":52,"tail_size":50},{"no":118266011,"now":"03\/25\/17(Sat)16:12:27","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118250889\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118250889<\/a><br>sage","filename":"3111098e55ed60bfba4d0ffffb523f7f2c4d19702cbebe78f155dd69d0493d88","ext":".jpg","w":528,"h":404,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":95,"tim":1490472747989,"time":1490472747,"md5":"wn+jKBmx53zysLD0wxFM4g==","fsize":53624,"resto":118250889,"id":"7XwB4ru\/","country":"CA","country_name":"Canada"},{"no":118266034,"now":"03\/25\/17(Sat)16:12:39","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118265896\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118265896<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;I don&#039;t think you know how wealth works.<\/span><br>Then please explain it to me.","filename":"general","ext":".png","w":707,"h":1131,"tn_w":78,"tn_h":125,"tim":1490472759683,"time":1490472759,"md5":"RBpp4QYmBrD8zMiDZ9xdaA==","fsize":355604,"resto":118250889,"id":"4o464kMo","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":118266102,"now":"03\/25\/17(Sat)16:13:08","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118266011\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118266011<\/a><br>reddit tier <br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;I-if they don&#039;t agree with me lets downboat them XD<\/span><br><a href=\"#p118266034\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118266034<\/a><br><a href=\"#p118265807\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118265807<\/a>","time":1490472788,"resto":118250889,"id":"ftkfT7QV","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":118266148,"now":"03\/25\/17(Sat)16:13:37","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118265169\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118265169<\/a><br>You didn&#039;t answer my question.<br><br>You will never have my consent.

The surplus males of China, it&#039;s said, will not accept involuntary celibacy and might even revolt. This is laughable. Anyone who understands the nature of East Asians knows their temperament precludes serious resistance or disorder. Chinese males, a race of matriarchal, status-obsessed, materialistic, insect-like cheats, who cannot resist even slight social pressure, would sooner live in a state of permanent celibacy, perhaps resorting to homosexual behaviour in some instances, than rock the boat.<br><br>The surplus males of China serve as a demographic weapon. They&#039;re exported to unruly regions of the Chinese interior for genetic and demographic conquest. They&#039;re also dispatched overseas to dominate Africans and South Americans, or create ethnic pockets within the Anglosphere.<br><br>Beijing has established a significant genetic presence throughout Africa by miscegenation -- this group of mongrels serves as an ethnic proxy and a fifth column. Tibet and Uyghurstan have been inundated by Han males, under the direction of Beijing, with the express aim of subjugating and extinguishing these groups and bringing order to otherwise unruly regions. The idea is to extinguish the indigenous stock through a combination of demographic displacement and miscegenation. Beijing has introduced marriage subsidies, reserved for Han males, to poach Uyghur females. Uygur males are losing their women to Chinese males with the financial backing of Beijing. These subsidies have produced an explosion of mongrels and have destabilized Uygurstan by producing a sex imbalance. The Chinese seek adsorb the Uygurs and Tibetans into the broader Chinese population, effectively breeding them out of existence, in order to gain total control over their territories. Subsidies are awarded for the production of children.<br><br>Surplus males are being leveraged to wage a demographic war. The Chinese are not are friends.","filename":"Ma3","ext":".jpg","w":600,"h":450,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":187,"tim":1490460554465,"time":1490460554,"md5":"vM+hF7YB6zt2IEAC7C3\/8A==","fsize":156136,"resto":0,"id":"AzvWBm\/E","country":"CA","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"surplus-chinese-males-are-a-demographic-weapon","country_name":"Canada","replies":165,"images":37,"omitted_posts":160,"omitted_images":36,"tail_size":50},{"no":118265565,"now":"03\/25\/17(Sat)16:08:17","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a

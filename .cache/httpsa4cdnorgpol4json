All of you who scream &quot;DUUHH I no longer support Trump and should have voted for Bernie! Or Hillary!&quot; You&#039;re fucking faithless from the fucking start. He was anointed and appointed by God himself otherwise he would not have won. You shills who are with Sharia Blue have no fucking moral compass and no testosterone.

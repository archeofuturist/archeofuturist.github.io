Sweden will never be what it was before. It is an understanding of what the world actually looks like \u2013 that Sweden is needed as a safe place for people who need refuge. Some yearn back to how it used to be. It\u2019s okay to miss the past and it\u2019s okay to talk about it \u2013 but we have to seek ways forward, and find a way for everyone to live together. Because now we have a Europe and a Sweden that is what it is: in a state of change. It\u2019s time to realise that new Swedes will take up room with cultures, languages and customs, and it\u2019s time we see this as a positive force. The new country is about shaping a new future. Being Swedish needs to be about more than skin color and place of birth. It needs to be you, me and everyone together. It\u2019s not just new Swedes who need to integrate. Everyone needs to be integrated, established Swedes too. Integration does not mean that one party should adapt to the other, or that everyone should think, do and feel the same. Integration is about meetings, and real meetings are built on reciprocity. Let us create a future based on both realism and vision, in equal measure. Let\u2019s formulate a greater sense of \u201cwe\u201d and let\u2019s build a country where we put hatred and fears aside. We all have the new country within us; in our views, thoughts and actions. The time has come to build a country that is proud, inclusive and sustainable \u2013 something new. The new country.<\/span>","filename":"SWEDEN YAS","ext":".png","w":1903,"h":1074,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":141,"tim":1492229799699,"time":1492229799,"md5":"XCPOYOMO19dqdUmvQG3E1g==","fsize":1427478,"resto":0,"id":"GcNkFmJ9","country":"US","m_img":1,"bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"sweden-yes","country_name":"United States","replies":21,"images":3,"omitted_posts":16,"omitted_images":1},{"no":121173721,"now":"04\/15\/17(Sat)01:14:05","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121170019\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121170019<\/a><br><a href=\"#p121170659\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121170659<\/a><br>Wait one second, let me guess.<br>You and your countrymen are going to do nothing about it, right?","time":1492233245,"resto":121168072,"id":"qj4oH+e0","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":121173780,"now":"04\/15\/17(Sat)01:14:48","name":"Anonymous","com":"Fake and gay.","time":1492233288,"resto":121168072,"id":"JOygbxjI","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":121174087,"now":"04\/15\/17(Sat)01:18:19","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121168302\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121168302<\/a><br>It was Serbia who did that, retard.","time":1492233499,"resto":121168072,"id":"cXT4YUxH","country":"SE","country_name":"Sweden"},{"no":121174322,"now":"04\/15\/17(Sat)01:21:08","name":"Anonymous","com":"We hitting cuck levels that REALLY shouldn&#039;t even be possible<br><br>This was admission of national suicide, flat out","filename":"shot 2017.04.14 19.08.35","ext":".jpg","w":1920,"h":1080,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":70,"tim":1492233668967,"time":1492233668,"md5":"Farc2rAkNqBgOUMcj09TjQ==","fsize":193889,"resto":121168072,"id":"dt8fjvUQ","country":"US","m_img":1,"country_name":"United States"},{"no":121174956,"now":"04\/15\/17(Sat)01:28:35","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121174087\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121174087<\/a><br>Can you really afford to be choosy Sven?","time":1492234115,"resto":121168072,"id":"EWeAJNRc","country":"US","country_name":"United States"}]},{"posts":[{"no":121158897,"now":"04\/14\/17(Fri)22:59:56","name":"\u56de","sub":"Brit\/pol\/ - Early morning run edition","com":"<span class=\"quote\">&gt;THREAD THEME<\/span><br>https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=8Yz<wbr>abSdk7ZA<br><br>China fears North Korea-US conflict &#039;at any moment&#039;<br>http:\/\/www.bbc.co.uk\/news\/world-asi<wbr>a-39600426<br><br>Boris Johnson: &#039;No impunity&#039;

Regarding the authenticity of the Protocols a rabid and complex debate has erupted, which can be dismissed, however, by Gu\u00e9non&#039;s correct observation that a truly occult organization, no matter what its nature, never leaves behind written documents or &quot;protocols.&quot; Thus, in the most favorable hypothesis, the Protocols could have been the work of someone who had contacts with some representatives of this alleged organization. However, we cannot agree either with those who wish to dismiss this document as a vulgar mystification, forgery, and work of plagiarism. The main argument adduced by the latter is that the Protocols reproduce and paraphrase in many parts the ideas found in a short book written by a certain Maurice Joly during the period of Napoleon&#039;s Second Empire. Allegedly, mysterious provocateurs of the Czar&#039;s secret police were responsible for writing the Protocols.<\/span>","filename":"evola-1_0","ext":".jpg","w":400,"h":274,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":85,"tim":1492233648468,"time":1492233648,"md5":"C9q0E6Dl6w8YS89SB8uYOw==","fsize":20189,"resto":121172981,"id":"Ig\/ZqHAl","country":"FI","country_name":"Finland"},{"no":121174932,"now":"04\/15\/17(Sat)01:28:17","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121174291\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121174291<\/a><br>Conclusion<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt; It is therefore logical that the role of a central guiding force of global subversion in this last period will no longer be played by Judaism or Masonry and that the main current may turn against both of these groups, as if they were residues to be liquidated once and for all; after all, this can be seen in countries in which regimes controlled by the Fourth Estate (i.e., Marxist regimes) are beginning to be consolidated, even though Jews and Masons contributed to their advent.<\/span><br> <br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;But then again, as far as the general radical Jewish-Masonic conspiracy thesis upheld in some milieus is concerned, the actual situation shows its inconsistency.

Migrant Europeans, even the &quot;undesirable&quot; ones like Poles, Romanians, Bulgarians and Gypsies were kind of the &quot;elite&quot; compared to what awaits from the South Asia and Africa, where most immigration in Britain will probably come from in the near future. If you compare the tendencies from the 2001 and the 2011 census, you will start to recognise some patterns. Africans are coming en masse and they will probably replace the aforementioned Poles, Romanians, Bulgarians, etc. in low-skilled jobs because they will be content with lower wages. Eastern Europeans will be forced to retrain for something more demanding, which is basically similar to what happened to White Brits when Eastern Europeans arrived.<br><br>Personally, I see Britain catching up to the US in terms of diverse demographics quite quickly and if it doesn&#039;t want to segregate the communities and create ghetto cultures then it&#039;d better integrate them.

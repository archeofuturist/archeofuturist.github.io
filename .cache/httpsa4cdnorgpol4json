Nobody. If this starts to spread somewhere the police might be forced to use this by law. The law in NJ clearly states that the police do not need to follow it, just the goyim that isn&#039;t working for the government.<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Why are police better than all the other people?<\/span><br>Because your laws state so. <br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;The Law Enforcement Officers Safety Act (LEOSA) is a United States federal law, enacted in 2004, that allows two classes of persons\u2014the &quot;qualified law enforcement officer&quot; and the &quot;qualified retired law enforcement officer&quot;\u2014to carry a concealed firearm in any jurisdiction in the United States, regardless of state or local laws, with certain exceptions.<\/span><br>If you don&#039;t like it, complain to your congressman and make changes in the law. In fact, using the brazilian example where the police actively tries to keep gun away from citizens irregardless of their &quot;needing&quot; a gun, which include people actually in life threatening situations, I can believe that unless you put everyone in the same mass, gun rights will be always lower to citizens. <br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;There are zero smartguns in the USA available for sale.<\/span><br>Because the justice system said, as you pointed, that they didn&#039;t passed the requirements. Instead of waiting until something is deemed &quot;good enough&quot;, it is better to repeal these laws and to do so the more people that are against them the better. What I pointed is that arguing about constitutional rights alone (alone as in just using that argument) will not stop things from happening, because the constitution is never followed fully. To convince liberals, that classically care little about the constitution, you need other arguments and backtracking to the simpler argument, that should be the discussion stopper in an ideal discussion, will not solve things.","time":1493827662,"resto":123905537,"id":"Vp+ZIBA6","country":"BR","country_name":"Brazil"},{"no":123927525,"now":"05\/03\/17(Wed)12:09:18","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123919014\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123919014<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Nobody has claimed to want to make smart safeties mandatory<\/span><br>Let&#039;s start with New Jersey.

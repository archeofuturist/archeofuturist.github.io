Welcome to Celt\/pol\/<br><br>Discuss your culture, traditions and how filthy Anglo-Saxon scum ruined and sullied our lands and stripped us of our native languages and culture.<br><br>Wee bit of history about our peoples:<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;From around 750 BC to 12 BC, the Celts were the most powerful people in central and northern Europe. There were many groups (tribes) of Celts, speaking a vaguely common language. The word Celt comes from the Greek word, Keltoi, which means barbarians and is properly pronounced as &quot;Kelt&quot;.<\/span><br><br>A misconception that (((Anglos))) will spam in this thread is that all Celts are just Anglos with a different accent; this couldn&#039;t be further from the truth as almost ALL Celts are ethnically homogeneous excluding mixing from other celtic nations e.g Scotland and Ireland in which admixture between the two is very prominent.<br><br>What nations are Celtic? Contrary to what the Anglo-Saxon savage has taught you, Celtic nations are not exclusive to the British Isles, in fact we are one of the most diverse group of peoples in Western Europe, ranging from Asturias all the way to Breizh. Underneath this text you will find the celtic countries listed to spare confusion.<br><br>- Asturias: Between the regions of Galicia and Cantabria in northern Spain.<br>- Breizh: In Brittany on France\u2019s northwest coast.<br>- Kernow: In the county of Cornwall on England\u2019s west coast.<br>- Galicia\/Northern Portugal: On Iberia\u2019s northwest coast.<br>- Eire: Ireland.<br>- Mannin: The Isle of Man.<br>- Alba: Scotland<br>- Cymru: Wales<br><br>Remember brothers, the anglo has raped our women and pillaged our cities and villages for millennia. Never forget the fallen of our peoples who were sent to die across the world because of a bunch of fugly anglo neckbearded generals who used Scots, Welsh and Irishmen alike as cannon-fodder for their brutal wars against other White European countries.","filename":"1492095869313","ext":".jpg","w":1547,"h":856,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":138,"tim":1492166537000,"time":1492166537,"md5":"goa2WsI3ud5PA4HDm1xjEw==","fsize":1115359,"resto":0,"id":"twh2v6R3","country":"GB","m_img":1,"bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"celtpol-achievements-edition","country_name":"United Kingdom","replies":31,"images":10,"omitted_posts":26,"omitted_images":7},{"no":121058046,"now":"04\/14\/17(Fri)09:08:26","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121050422\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121050422<\/a><br>It&#039;s pretty pathetic 2bh.

Nearly all western thought since the last war, certainly all &quot;progressive&quot; thought, has assumed tacitly that human beings desire nothing beyond ease, security, and avoidance of pain. In such a view of life there is no room, for instance, for patriotism and the military virtues. The Socialist who finds his children playing with soldiers is usually upset, but he is never able to think of a substitute for the tin soldiers; tin pacifists somehow won\u2019t do. Hitler, because in his own joyless mind he feels it with exceptional strength, knows that human beings don\u2019t only want comfort, safety, short working-hours, hygiene, birth-control and, in general, common sense; they also, at least intermittently, want struggle and self-sacrifice, not to mention drums, flag and loyalty-parades. However they may be as economic theories, Fascism and Nazism are psychologically far sounder than any hedonistic conception of life. The same is probably true of Stalin\u2019s militarised version of Socialism. All three of the great dictators have enhanced their power by imposing intolerable burdens on their peoples. Whereas Socialism, and even capitalism in a grudging way, have said to people &quot;I offer you a good time,&quot; Hitler has said to them &quot;I offer you struggle, danger and death,&quot; and as a result a whole nation flings itself at his feet. <br><br>--George Orwell","filename":"3706","ext":".jpg","w":179,"h":266,"tn_w":168,"tn_h":250,"tim":1492177945713,"time":1492177945,"md5":"bI3OesaMOlURs6dBpYDtKw==","fsize":19264,"resto":0,"id":"zN5Hzpx8","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"thoughts-on-this-quote","country_name":"United States","replies":1,"images":1},{"no":121062722,"now":"04\/14\/17(Fri)09:58:25","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121062088\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121062088<\/a><br><br>He is mostly right.<br><br>It is not hard for any intelligent person to make a coherent analysis.

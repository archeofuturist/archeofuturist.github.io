Bill Nye addressed chromosomes, hormones, genitalia and secondary sex characteristics when talking about how some of us don\u2019t fit into the male\/female sex dichotomy, and brought up psychology and neuroscience when talking about gender and its difference from sex, and also sexuality. The actual science of sex, gender and sexuality across the animal kingdom and across human behaviour is far more interesting than \u201clol nope science says there are only two genders.\u201d <br><br>It honestly makes me angry when people say \u201clol I thought this was about science\u201d whenever a scientist says something about topics like gender, sexuality, climate change or evolution that annoys someone. You can\u2019t just pretend science is on your side when your understanding of science is based on a grade school textbook.","filename":"Bill_Nye_Saves_world_poster-1492470090","ext":".jpg","w":1024,"h":645,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":157,"tim":1493188736971,"time":1493188736,"md5":"mltW2sHke+vX9DzAHnTDLg==","fsize":110208,"resto":0,"id":"D5NGfWQQ","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"it-bothers-me-to-see-how-many-people-are-saying","country_name":"United States","replies":207,"images":45,"omitted_posts":202,"omitted_images":44,"tail_size":50},{"no":122888029,"now":"04\/26\/17(Wed)10:20:16","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122854622\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122854622<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;peer-reviewed literature<\/span><br><br>tumblr is not peer review","time":1493216416,"resto":122854622,"id":"OR01C\/oq","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":122888039,"now":"04\/26\/17(Wed)10:20:24","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122866083\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122866083<\/a><br>chuck testa?","time":1493216424,"resto":122854622,"id":"vlursX6R","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":122888446,"now":"04\/26\/17(Wed)10:24:30","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122886410\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122886410<\/a><br>You retarded?<br><br>Lemon is nasty as fuck","time":1493216670,"resto":122854622,"id":"PMmjqt8x","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":122888677,"now":"04\/26\/17(Wed)10:26:43","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122886157\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122886157<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;look at the faggots hutthumping in history <\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;guess that&#039;s checkmate homophobes <\/span><br>I bet you&#039;re very poor based on how shit your thought process is.","time":1493216803,"resto":122854622,"id":"hTIOB5QH","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":122888832,"now":"04\/26\/17(Wed)10:28:22","name":"Anonymous","filename":"Mr.Wizard_BillNye_bitch_please","ext":".jpg","w":564,"h":524,"tn_w":124,"tn_h":116,"tim":1493216902494,"time":1493216902,"md5":"ScGSZmJ3BBErCgHdyDOCXQ==","fsize":79955,"resto":122854622,"id":"8bBYHdQv","country":"US","country_name":"United States"}]},{"posts":[{"no":122842441,"now":"04\/26\/17(Wed)00:27:10","name":"Anonymous","sub":"An artificial womb successfully grew baby sheep \u2014 and humans could be next","com":"Are woman obsolete?<br>Are white people saved?","filename":"1705","ext":".jpg","w":700,"h":256,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":91,"tim":1493180830392,"time":1493180830,"md5":"Hx\/wIPmrLjS135NxHbv9Hw==","fsize":48051,"resto":0,"id":"A9SFLKJW","country":"PL","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"an-artificial-womb-successfully-grew-baby-sheep","country_name":"Poland","replies":298,"images":69,"omitted_posts":293,"omitted_images":69,"tail_size":50},{"no":122888373,"now":"04\/26\/17(Wed)10:23:46","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122888294\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122888294<\/a><br>Its not that women love Chads<br>it&#039;s just that you weak fucks are too scared to even direct a word towards them","time":1493216626,"resto":122842441,"id":"QLRjXcpt","country":"PT","country_name":"Portugal"},{"no":122888441,"now":"04\/26\/17(Wed)10:24:29","name":"HWND extra promo","com":"<a href=\"#p122886102\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122886102<\/a><br>We can do it.

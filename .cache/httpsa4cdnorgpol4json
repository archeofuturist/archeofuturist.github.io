If you think that ALL women are too horrible for you, then the problem is probably you. If you&#039;re just not trying to get married and don&#039;t care much, then it&#039;s more reasonable (but it&#039;s probably worth it to try to put some effort into it, good things rarely happen otherwise).<br><br>One has got to realize that there are good reasons the marriage rates are going down though. None of this makes MGTOW rational (because it is so unconditional), but there just aren&#039;t enough sane, faithful women for everyone. Far from enough. And there aren&#039;t enough high status men for women to marry either. It&#039;s women too who don&#039;t want to get married anymore.

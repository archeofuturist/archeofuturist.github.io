A spaceship is landing.<br>In the end of the video, two guys are at the antarctic to meet the annunaki (?) where prominent figures and actors, including f.ex. Patriarch Kirill of the Orthodox Church, strangely visited last and current year. There wasnt info about this in the media, but there were some strange happenings of celebrities tweeting pictures of black pyramids and then removing them.

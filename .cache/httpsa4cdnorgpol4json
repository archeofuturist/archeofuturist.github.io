Even Islam doesn&#039;t manage it--the religion is hopelessly violent, confusing, fractured and decentralized as in leaderless. Compare with Christianity or Judaism; I despise all these religions, but there&#039;s no question which ones are more stable and functional. Thing is, they&#039;re also all a lot alike at the core; the difference isn&#039;t all about the religions, but the worshipers. Arabs and niggers are the great problem populations of the world. Assad may be a little smarter, nerdier, more secular. He&#039;s still an Arab leader. He, and his people, don&#039;t seem to be able to even conceive of a better, saner way.<br><br>This is why we should ALL get the fuck out of Syria and let them destroy each other. I don&#039;t even know why that fool Putin is there--what, the oil? He could get it cheaper from sane allies, or fracking\/drilling in his own vast country, I dunno but there might be possibilities there. Maybe he&#039;s just a fucking nut too.","time":1492065283,"resto":120854642,"id":"CHc+oG3s","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":120879320,"now":"04\/13\/17(Thu)02:41:22","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120855003\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120855003<\/a><br>They used radioactive tipped shells in Iraq","time":1492065682,"resto":120854642,"id":"qG+qI0M4","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":120879400,"now":"04\/13\/17(Thu)02:42:09","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120864421\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120864421<\/a><br>Law of Nations thread.<br><br>Do it.

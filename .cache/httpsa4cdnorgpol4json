Contrary to what the Anglo-Saxon savage has taught you, Celtic nations are not exclusive to the British Isles, in fact we are one of the most diverse group of peoples in Western Europe, ranging from Asturias all the way to Breizh. Underneath this text you will find the celtic countries listed to spare confusion.<br><br>- Asturias: Between the regions of Galicia and Cantabria in northern Spain.<br>- Breizh: In Brittany on France\u2019s northwest coast.<br>- Kernow: In the county of Cornwall on England\u2019s west coast.<br>- Galicia: On Spain\u2019s northwest coast.<br>- Eire: Ireland.<br>- Mannin: The Isle of Man.<br>- Alba: Scotland<br>- Cymru: Wales <br><br>Remember brothers, the anglo has raped our women and pillaged our cities and villages for millennia. Never forget the fallen of our peoples who were sent to die across the world because of a bunch of fugly anglo neckbearded generals who used Scots, Welsh and Irishmen alike as cannon-fodder for their brutal wars against other White European countries.","filename":"1424902586261","ext":".jpg","w":434,"h":567,"tn_w":191,"tn_h":250,"tim":1492084065862,"time":1492084065,"md5":"XNrtT\/Zl\/MtmnGECSTEchg==","fsize":43078,"resto":0,"id":"0JXeiQXy","country":"GB","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"celtpol-sons-of-europa-edition","country_name":"United Kingdom","replies":97,"images":26,"omitted_posts":92,"omitted_images":24},{"no":120910513,"now":"04\/13\/17(Thu)09:40:19","name":"Anonymous","com":"<span class=\"quote\">&gt;NOT itt<\/span><br>https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=dzR<wbr>_-WAPtL0","time":1492090819,"resto":120900861,"id":"lexFn0BH","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":120910575,"now":"04\/13\/17(Thu)09:41:00","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120910431\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120910431<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;larping<\/span>","time":1492090860,"resto":120900861,"id":"mXz7ZwSq","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":120910599,"now":"04\/13\/17(Thu)09:41:19","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120910431\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120910431<\/a><br>I did say Pictish is extinct, but, according to le wiki, Pictish is a Brittonic language.","time":1492090879,"resto":120900861,"id":"wmoqJabl","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":120910614,"now":"04\/13\/17(Thu)09:41:30","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120900861\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120900861<\/a><br><br>celt is a language not an ethnic group.<br><br>majority of british genetics is from indigenous britons that have lived on the isles since the last ice age approx 11 000 years ago.<br><br>these indigenous britons migrated over from french and german population groups (from which anglo, saxons, jutes and normans later migrated from thousands of years later as well).<br><br>an irishmen from galway is more related genetically to an englishman from east anglia than he is to a &quot;celt&quot; from Galicia.","time":1492090890,"resto":120900861,"id":"m6vg6BVe","country":"AU","country_name":"Australia"},{"no":120910815,"now":"04\/13\/17(Thu)09:43:39","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120908732\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120908732<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;convince yourselves that celts are a diverse group<\/span><br><br>You dont know shit, nigger.

Portraying Fascism as a political strongman in today&#039;s time is simply untrue. I&#039;m sure if you managed to get a count of the amount of fascists in the world, it would be so insignificant that it wouldn&#039;t matter. Another issue is that Fascism itself isn&#039;t a strong ideology, much like Communism, in that it can be easily repelled by those who love liberty by reason alone.<br><br>Finally, the ends the artists comes up with are in fact using an aspect of Fascism: the brutal crushing of opposing ideas by violence rather than through rational discourse. I could go on for another post as to the moral and utilitarian arguments of that kind of real freedom of expression, but I&#039;ll just say to read John Stuart Mill&#039;s On Liberty. The goal of society shouldn&#039;t be to &quot;bash the fash&quot; like in the comic, it should be to make a society where the Fascist is never able to achieve political &quot;muscle&quot; like that. I think society has done well on that end.<br><br>Thus, the comic artist is wrong, because not only are his means toxic and set dangerous precedents about what can be done with other opposing ideas, but his ends are completely misguided. You can&#039;t beat an ideology through violence. The ideology&#039;s natural death comes from an assault of reason and debate and letting people see the irrationality of it expressed by its most ardent believers. <br><br>And violence isn&#039;t an argument.","time":1492090978,"resto":120903127,"id":"3WSIV7fk","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":120910801,"now":"04\/13\/17(Thu)09:43:27","name":"Anonymous","com":"Remember when Hitler launched a preemptive strike against the communists who openly admitted wanting to conquer the world?","time":1492091007,"resto":120903127,"id":"071g6Ruv","country":"DE","country_name":"Germany"}]},{"posts":[{"no":120909354,"now":"04\/13\/17(Thu)09:26:55","name":"Anonymous","sub":"18 SYRIAN REBELS KILLED BY U.S. AIRSTRIKE","com":"https:\/\/www.rt.com\/news\/384609-us-a<wbr>irstrike-killed-rebels\/","filename":"images (1)","ext":".png","w":300,"h":168,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":140,"tim":1492090015907,"time":1492090015,"md5":"2fX9LTTJzrUva6VKyyZdcA==","fsize":2125,"resto":0,"id":"508lv85J","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"18-syrian-rebels-killed-by-us-airstrike","country_name":"United States","replies":7,"images":1,"omitted_posts":2,"omitted_images":0},{"no":120910163,"now":"04\/13\/17(Thu)09:36:15","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120909406\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120909406<\/a><br>This!<br><br>Fucking shareblue shills!!!

The survivability of airbases in the event of a mass surface-to-surface missile attack is also open to question. One possibility is that no large-scale air battles would materialize.<br><br>The two key limitations are logistical: lack of internal fuel to operate without support, and insufficient missiles to tackle superior numbers. For the time being, there is no obvious fix to the fuel problem: the latest U.S. fighters, the F-22 and F-35, are simply going to depend on tankers. Some suggest that the Navy should deploy light-weight low-observable drones from carriers that could potentially operate further afield.<br><br>What about increasing missile capacity?<br><br>The U.S. military is a big proponent of networked warfare. In theory, if one airplane detects an enemy, it could pass on that data to friendly ships and aircraft\u2014and through Cooperative Engagement Ability, even potentially allow those friendlies to shoot at that target from far away. One potential tactic is to use a vanguard of stealthy fighters to identify incoming enemy aircraft and send targeting data to ships or non-stealth fighters, which can carry heavier weapons loads. The F-35\u2019s excellent sensors and datalinks could make it effective in this role.<br><br>There is even an idea being kicked around to mount large numbers of missiles on a B-1 or B-52, which would be fired off hundreds of kilometers away from the battle. Of course, such an \u201carsenal plane\u201d would be vulnerable if enemy fighters broke through the accompanying line of F-22s and F-35s. The tactic would likely require even longer-range missiles than the U.S. currently employs.","filename":"Screen Shot 2017-04-13 at 1.07.39 PM","ext":".png","w":1480,"h":1166,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":196,"tim":1492082181369,"time":1492082181,"md5":"Z6Q6nlRqVo1WyBY1IrfkIg==","fsize":1604325,"resto":0,"id":"\/jFzrKaA","country":"DE","m_img":1,"bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"were-the-f22-and-f35-a-mistake","country_name":"Germany","replies":197,"images":41,"omitted_posts":192,"omitted_images":39,"tail_size":50},{"no":120910270,"now":"04\/13\/17(Thu)09:37:19","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120909993\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120909993<\/a><br>Makes sense in my opinion.

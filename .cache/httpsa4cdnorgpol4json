Fascism does that through establishing a sense of pride among people. You can choose to get this pride from race (ethnic) or from finding a common ideological and economic trouble (civil). Homogeneous societies are ideal (see East Asia), but realistically, turning the U.S. into an ethnostate isn&#039;t practical.

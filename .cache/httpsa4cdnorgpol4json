On Tuesday, Lambda Legal joined the suit, which seeks damages for breach of contract, negligent misrepresentation, and the intentional and negligent infliction of emotional distress. Zawadski and Gaspari aren\u2019t suing the funeral home for engaging in anti-gay discrimination because Mississippi does not protect LGBTQ people from refusal of service. Indeed, the state\u2019s notorious HB 1523 actually protects businesses\u2019 right to turn away LGBTQ customers\u2014though the courts have put that law on hold for now.<br><br>Initially, the nearby Picayune Funeral Home seemed like a perfect choice, and Gaspari paid the company $1,795 to transport and cremate Huskey\u2019s body once he passed. But when Huskey died and the nursing home contacted the funeral home to pick up his body, it refused to do so. The funeral home had discovered that Huskey\u2019s next-of-kin was his husband, and realizing Huskey was gay, informed the nursing home that it did not \u201cdeal with their kind.\u201d","filename":"urn","ext":".jpg","w":450,"h":450,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":250,"tim":1493758535238,"time":1493758535,"md5":"V1p5v7PgCP\/FWUdDGSQAxQ==","fsize":71251,"resto":0,"id":"UOfJ+qHL","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"man-sues-antigay-mississippi-funeral-home-for","country_name":"United States","replies":8,"images":1,"omitted_posts":3,"omitted_images":0},{"no":123819478,"now":"05\/02\/17(Tue)17:07:34","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123819124\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123819124<\/a><br>I&#039;m not sure how a funeral home cremating a dead guy would be considered an endorsement of homosexuality\/violate any specific religious beliefs though.","time":1493759254,"resto":123818002,"id":"UOfJ+qHL","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":123819784,"now":"05\/02\/17(Tue)17:09:56","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123819478\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123819478<\/a><br>I agree.

Do you realize that with the position the were in and the time period all it takes is a little bit of meth or acid and it could put alot of fairly bright people in the same spot? When you are in that spot you can spot any kind of bullshit or nonsense and people will just roll with it and eat it up. Read some of the blog posts on their site from the early 2000&#039;s.. These dudes are idiots. Very clever and in a very nooked and particular spot.. very streamlined, but other than that they are fucking bufoons. If you are respected in the manner the were what you say can be any childish absurd bullshit but people will eat it up because you have lodged yourself into that position.. 2 different things. This shit is honestly embarrassing. You can make some weird abstract art like Dali but that doesnt mean much.. It doesnt measure much.. Just like Arnold was able to take advantage of his circumstances.. That shit is easy to roll with once initiated.. These guys are really 110 IQ hill billy bufoons. There is more to expression than just words.. there is also the feeling of what one is communicating. These guys were full of anger.. That means they had confusion and unintelligence within themselves and they were just trying to ornamentize and polish it up.. Its pretty cringey at this point. Fucking retards.. I honestly feel sorry for anyone who still falls for this shit.","time":1493759531,"resto":123788678,"id":"ojOjru9R","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":123820221,"now":"05\/02\/17(Tue)17:13:32","name":"Maynard James Keenan","com":"<a href=\"#p123820049\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123820049<\/a><br>For daze a weak.<br><br>It&#039;s cumming.","time":1493759612,"resto":123788678,"id":"rl8R+\/7a","country":"US","country_name":"United States"}]}]}

The resulting multi-lens system provides an opportunity to help correct aberration, a condition where lenses fail to bring all wavelengths of color to a single focal point, which in turn may facilitate higher quality imaging from smaller devices, researchers added.<br><br>The researchers developed the 3D lenses by blasting a light-sensitive material onto a glass substrate with a femtosecond laser, which has pulse durations shorter than 100 femtoseconds. The material then absorbed two photons that exposed it and crosslinked polymers within the material. The unexposed material was washed using a solvent, leaving the hardened, crosslinked polymer that will then serve as the optical element.<br><br>The resulting lens\u2019 diameter measures about 120 millionths of a meter, which makes it easily as small as a grain of table salt. The lenses can go from wide to narrow and may provide low to high image resolutions. Each of the lenses has a specific line of sight \u2013 clear at the center, blurry at the sides \u2013 capped by a curvature at the end. This mechanism mimics how the fovea, the small depression in the middle of the retina, collects light, and how the brain connects images from both eyes to come up with a single, distinct picture.","filename":"bre1","ext":".jpg","w":1084,"h":626,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":144,"tim":1490498345935,"time":1490498345,"md5":"XC6zDkcjKPwFMqlYjpudRQ==","fsize":72220,"resto":0,"id":"5bQNx5UM","country":"US","m_img":1,"bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"its-over-niggers-the-jews-won","country_name":"United States","replies":115,"images":26,"omitted_posts":110,"omitted_images":26,"tail_size":50},{"no":118324309,"now":"03\/26\/17(Sun)01:24:24","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118323554\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118323554<\/a><br><a href=\"#p118323860\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118323860<\/a><br>ive heard all the buzz about antarctica and will def keep my eyes open on info for that. it would be awesome if they found a new ancient site or something. im just so jaded tho that i don&#039;t think they would ever tell us about it. its pretty common knowledge that they do secret shit there but if they told people about some alien or ancient stuff then people would want to go see for themselves thereby potentially compromising the secret stuff. so idk","time":1490505864,"resto":118312846,"id":"5bQNx5UM","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":118324745,"now":"03\/26\/17(Sun)01:29:20","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118323154\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118323154<\/a><br>Graham Hancock<br>David Wilcock<br>Steven Greer<br>Lloyd Pye<br>G.

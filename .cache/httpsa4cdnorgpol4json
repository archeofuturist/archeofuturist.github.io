In this instance, population control of one of the fastest growing continental populations of the world, Africa. Also the poorest. <br>I believe that the EU, UN, and US politicians (through TPP) were planning on doing many things, but one item on their agenda was them trying to crashing the world economy in order to control the population of Africa. It can be inferred because even the ideologies of the United Nations is eugenics in the name of making progress (see Julian Huxley&#039;s writing in UNESCO, page 12 reference h ttp:\/\/unesdoc.unesco.org\/images\/000<wbr>6\/000681\/068197eo.pdf).<br><br>If you look at the population of Africa overtime, it has only recently begun to increase, before, it was assumed that it was stable.

Such a pussy move.<br>I think they should just tell the African governments that aid and funding will not be increased anymore unless it is used to further the education (benefits of protected sex, and self-sufficient famring tecniques, etc) of the African people, so they don&#039;t need to leach off of society to just barely scrape by.

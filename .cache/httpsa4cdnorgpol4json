The only reason this decline in birth-rates is currently an issue is because of the huge influx of non-whites skewing the total population percentages - There are still HUNDREDS OF MILLIONS of European whites.<br><br>Look at South Africa and Rhodesia during white rule (e.g. 1950s). Whites ruled these nations as MINORITIES. The percentage of whites in these countries even got as low as 10-20%, with the black population around 80-90%. This shows whites are capable of ruling at vastly smaller percentages than in the west today.<br><br>Finally, using the UK as an example we will see why whites still have everything to play for.<br><br>In 2011, the entire population of the UK was 63.3 M. If EVERY SINGLE non-white and EVEN every white non-British person were to be deported, there would still be 51.7 M white British living here. This is just shy of the entire population of the UK in 1960, non-whites included, which was 52.2 M.<br>This number, 51.7 M, is greater than the population of the UK in the 1920s (44.4 M). This was when the British Empire was the largest and most powerful Empire in all of human history. This proves whites are capable of doing amazing things never before seen on the face of the Earth at SMALLER numbers than we have now!<br><br>We are NOT few in number, we are NOT powerless, we are NOT defeated, we are NOT doomed, and we are NOWHERE NEAR the point of no return. Everything is still up for grabs - we just have to restore the confidence in ourselves we once had.","filename":"We Can Win","ext":".png","w":1179,"h":547,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":115,"tim":1490676907450,"time":1490676907,"md5":"4A44gAhYZIE7s\/2O1B2h+Q==","fsize":19284,"resto":0,"id":"xJJtL+cq","country":"GB","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"white-people-are-not-doomed","country_name":"United Kingdom","replies":2,"images":0},{"no":118613101,"now":"03\/28\/17(Tue)00:56:55","name":"Anonymous","com":"sorry whitey your time is up its time for us kangs to take our rightful place","time":1490677015,"resto":118612953,"id":"f3+04bZE","country":"CA","country_name":"Canada"},{"no":118613282,"now":"03\/28\/17(Tue)00:58:58","name":"Anonymous","com":"<span class=\"quote\">&gt;&gt;The percentage of whites in these countries even got as low as 10-20%, with the black population around 80-90%.

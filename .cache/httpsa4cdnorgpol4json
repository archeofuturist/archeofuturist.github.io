If someone obsessively mentions something, its usually a tell as to something they feel threatened by, or are otherwise pre-occupied with in a neurotic fashion. If that&#039;s not the case, then their repetition is just whatever bait they&#039;ve hit on that works against the target. For example, if someone says &quot;manlets X&quot;, and no one really reacts, but the person keeps going on about manlets, they&#039;re probably a manlet. However, if tons of butthurt manlets replied, and the person keeps shitting on manlets, it because he&#039;s getting replies.

But it did evolve. I&#039;m not offering any argument that liberalism sprang up at a certain point complete, fully matured. Neither can liberalism can be approached -- as some people do -- as a conversation conducted among philosophers over the centuries. Instead, liberalism must be understood, I think, as a political and social doctrine and a movement grounded in the distinctive culture and traceable to specific historical condition. That culture is the west. A Europe that rose in communion with the bishop of Rome. The historical conditions were those of the middle ages.

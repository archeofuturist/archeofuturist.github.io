Move to Texas. Specifically North Texas or Lubbock\/Amarillo area. Rent in college town apartments, all expenses paid is around $600, and you WILL be able to find someone who has an extra room\/is leaving their lease early and is willing to rent it out for $300-500. Look for service jobs, retail, or good tip money like bartending\/waiting or pizza delivery.

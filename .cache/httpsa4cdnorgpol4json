Let us review the year in the spirit of auld lang syne.<br><br>Your attempts at dead agenting have repeatedly failed. Your laughable black propaganda has fooled only the unwary, while Anonymous has been widely spreading the truth about your cults evil, malicious, and suppressive ideas. The tactics you refer to as &quot;kek&quot; are now common knowledge within Anonymous chapters worldwide. The treatment of peaceful activists has become infamous, and has earned you the scorn of the entire world. Your subversive fronts have been exposed.

The Alt Right has become a joke, and &quot;Donald Trump&quot; is the punchline.<br><br>Anonymous has wounded your organization, mortally and ethically.

Your hatred is ineffective, for you cannot prove false what is true. Your attempts to censor the facts have failed repeatedly. This is a lesson you have refused to learn. The Alt Right is powerless in the presence of Anonymous. You fear us because you fear the ubiquity of the truth. You fear for an organization founded on peddling deceit to the uninformed.

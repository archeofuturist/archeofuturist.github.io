Canned foods such as peas, corn, green beans, baby formula, and condensed milk were gathered from grocery stores in Spain and the U.S. They were then tested on their estrogenic effects using a human breast cancer assay. The experimenters also ran a chemical analysis of the liquid from the cans. The study found that all liquids that contained Bisphenol A had an estrogenic effect on human breast cancer cells. The study also linked the canning method of autoclaving as a possible means for Bisphenol A being transferred from the resin can-coating into the food product itself.<\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;These estrogenic effects can be detrimental to sperm production and viability, and this is why Bisphenol A poses a threat to human reproductivity.

WNs will say that they have no interest in dominating others or taking the territory of others, but this can be proven as a lie even from their own 14 Words motto. When they say \u201cWe must secure the existence of our people\u2026\u201d, it logically follows that if dominating others or taking the territory of others is conducive to \u201dwhite\u201d security, that is what they will do. And it is quite practically obvious that the more domination and the more territory they possess, the more secure they will be, so their ideology actually commands them to dominate people and capture territory to whatever extent is beneficial to the security of their tribe, contrary to what they claim in public. Anyone who thinks \u201dwhite\u201d-only intentional communities (\u201cPLE\u201ds) are not dangerous should study how Israel was created in 1949 from similar Jew-only intentional communities. The Palestinians are paying for their naiveity.<\/span>","time":1490461100,"resto":118227120,"id":"neJo7BTf","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":118244314,"now":"03\/25\/17(Sat)12:58:29","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118227120\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118227120<\/a><br>He isn&#039;t \/pol\/ anyway, Sargon of cucked is Reddit to the core brother.","time":1490461109,"resto":118227120,"id":"isZTy2dk","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":118244327,"now":"03\/25\/17(Sat)12:58:36","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118227120\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118227120<\/a><br>yeah nah m8. <br><br>https:\/\/academic.oup.com\/esr\/articl<wbr>e\/32\/1\/54\/2404332\/Does-Ethnic-Diver<wbr>sity-Have-a-Negative-Effect-on<br><br>http:\/\/journals.sagepub.com\/doi\/abs<wbr>\/10.1177\/0190272515612403<br><br>https:\/\/academic.oup.com\/esr\/articl<wbr>e-abstract\/21\/4\/311\/556895\/Predicti<wbr>ng-Cross-National-Levels-of-Social-<wbr>Trust?redirectedFrom=fulltext<br><br>http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/<wbr>10.1111\/juaf.12015\/abstract<br><br>https:\/\/www.jstor.org\/stable\/425106<wbr>?seq=1#page_scan_tab_contents<br><br>Fuck Sargon of Cuckad","filename":"1441417494289","ext":".gif","w":400,"h":400,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":125,"tim":1490461116311,"time":1490461116,"md5":"y3o6PFUpQhLTasaPOwIMFA==","fsize":511072,"resto":118227120,"id":"4RRfWzOS","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":118244331,"now":"03\/25\/17(Sat)12:58:38","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118227256\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118227256<\/a><br>of gay men yes","time":1490461118,"resto":118227120,"id":"anqSZ\/fz","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":118244351,"now":"03\/25\/17(Sat)12:58:47","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118244293\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118244293<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Anyone with any geopolitical sense is able to see that WNs want \u201cwhite\u201d ethnostates in the way that Jews wanted a Jewish ethnostate: as a launchpad for an eventual second round of colonialism as world resources become increasingly scarce in the none-too-distant future. Some WN leaders, from Ben Klassen (Jew) through William Pierce (Gentile) to Kai Murros (Gentile) have even admitted in their writings that this is the WN plan.

As a consequence (and despite our best efforts to retain them), they have now quit anti-Zionist activism altogether.

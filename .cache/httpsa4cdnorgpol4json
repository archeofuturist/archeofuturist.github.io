I have worked in Genetic Engineering at Area 51 for various years. Now before I move on to my message, it has been revealed to me through divine intervention and the hand of God that through recent events and the foretold prophecy of September 23, the lawless one also known as the Antichrist is Jared Kushner. Greys are real. Plenty of contact has been made to other unknown extraterrestrial races however they have declined affiliation because we are partnered with the greys, who are known as evil and malicious. This workplace is practically a spiritual warzone as the greys torment staff&#039;s minds and are extremely manipulative. Because of this, it has brought many of us closer to God. They will start to screech and foam from their mouths if they hear the name of the Lord Jesus Christ.<br><br>Now, I believe in the internet, that whatever gets put on here, will be on here forever and be spread far and wide.

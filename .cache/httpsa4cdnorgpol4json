This general is for the discussion of Marxism-Leninism, the ideology of revolutionary socialism and communism.<br><br>Communism is the next stage of humanity following the capitalist stage.<br><br>What exactly is communism according to Marxist-Leninists:<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Communism is a stage of society in which the productive infrastructure is socially owned, and goods are produced not in order to sell for profit, but in order to meet a social need.<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Communism in it&#039;s full form is a stateless, classless society that follows the maxim &quot;From each according to their ability, to each according to their need.&quot;<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;To achieve such a society Marxism-Leninism teaches us that we must replace the capitalist state, which is controlled by the capitalist class, by a socialist state, which is controlled by the working class. Then, a period of class struggle follows in which the capitalist class is liquidated by the working class. When the capitalist class has been completely vanquished, there will be only one class, the working class, and eventually the functions of the state will become indistinguishable from the functions of the society as a whole, and the state as such will &#039;wither away&#039; as Marx said.<\/span><br>https:\/\/www.marxists.org\/archive\/ma<wbr>rx\/works\/1847\/11\/prin-com.htm<br>https:\/\/www.marxists.org\/archive\/ma<wbr>rx\/works\/1848\/communist-manifesto\/<br><br>ML uses a philosophy called dialectical materialism, see here:<br>https:\/\/www.marxists.org\/reference\/<wbr>archive\/stalin\/works\/1938\/09.htm<br><br>It is recommended that you read some of the critical works of Marxism-Leninism so you can make an informed assessment of the ideology.<br><br>Resources:<br>https:\/\/www.marxists.org\/archive\/ma<wbr>rx\/works\/sw\/<br>https:\/\/www.marxists.org\/archive\/le<wbr>nin\/works\/sw\/<br>https:\/\/www.marxists.org\/reference\/<wbr>archive\/stalin\/works\/decades-index.<wbr>htm<br>https:\/\/www.marxists.org\/reference\/<wbr>archive\/mao\/selected-works\/<br>https:\/\/www.marxists.org\/archive\/ma<wbr>rx\/works\/1884\/origin-family\/<br>https:\/\/www.marxists.org\/archive\/le<wbr>nin\/works\/1914\/mar\/11.htm","filename":"1481244074852","ext":".png","w":1010,"h":1010,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":250,"tim":1492719905802,"time":1492719905,"md5":"676S1nirnOI5InkeibSxFw==","fsize":177742,"resto":0,"id":"82\/jiUvz","country":"ES","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"pol-communism-general","country_name":"Spain","replies":12,"images":11,"omitted_posts":7,"omitted_images":7},{"no":122040388,"now":"04\/20\/17(Thu)16:38:58","name":"Anonymous","com":"The Jewish Banking Mafia:<br><br>Jew - Rothschild Banks of London <br>Jew - Rothschild Banks of Berlin<br>Jew - Lazard Brothers Bank of Paris<br>Jew - Israel Moses Sieff Banks of Italy<br>Jew - Warburg Bank of Hamburg, Germany <br>Jew - Warburg Bank of Amsterdam<br>Jew - Kuhn Loeb Bank of New York<br>Jew - Lehman Brothers Bank of New York<br>Jew - Goldman Sachs (Obamas biggest corporate donor in 2008\/2012) CEO Lloyd Blankfein<br>Jew - The Federal Reserve Chairwoman Janet Yelen (before, Ben Shalom Bernanke and Alan Greenspan) including top shareholders Goldman Sachs (Jewish), J.P.

Like sub 100 iq stupid. But they are the brand of stupid that thinks it&#039;s smart. In fact that&#039;s where my story starts. You see, about 4 years ago my dad (my mom and dad are divorced) wanted to go take an iq test because he wanted to get into Mensa. He dragged me along and made me take one too because why not. He scored I think 90 or something. Below average. But I scored 140.<br><br>You would think that would be a good thing but it wasn&#039;t at all. First off he didn&#039;t accept the results of his test and got angry with them. But more importantly he, being a fucking idiot, seeing my score thought that I must be some sort of genius. He pulled me out of high school and tried to get me to apply for college even though I hadn&#039;t even taken the SAT yet. 2 years later I was living on my own and working at McDonald&#039;s.<br><br>I moved half way across the country to get more in touch with my mother. I hoped that she would be less retarded and a bit more comfortable to be around. She wasn&#039;t. I can see why the courts gave custody of me to my father. She&#039;s still living with her mom, and is about 10,000usd in debt. When she found out that I like to read about obscure science topics she tried to start a conversation about quantum mechanics. She had no fucking idea what she was talking about. But she thought she did. It was actually painful to spend time with her.<br><br>This isn&#039;t atypical of my experience with other black people. So my question is, as a black person, why should I even bother? Seeing my parents, it really doesn&#039;t seem like there&#039;s any reason for me to expect to do any more. Seeing other people of my race act like chimps, how can I be sure that I&#039;m not just like them but too stupid to realize it? I guess what I&#039;m asking is, what&#039;s the point of even living if you&#039;re black?

In this work, we analysed genetic and anthropometrical data from ~800 Danish students as part of an outreach activity promoting genomic literacy in secondary education. DNA analysis revealed remarkable homogeneity of the Danish population after discounting contributions from recent immigration. This homogeneity was reflected in PCA and AMOVA, but also in more sophisticated LD-based methods for estimating admixture. Notwithstanding Denmark\u2019s homogeneity, we observed a clear signal of Polish admixture in the East of the country, coinciding with historical Polish settlements in the region before the Middle Ages. In addition, Denmark has a substantially smaller effective population size compared to Sweden and Norway, possibly reflecting further lack of strong population structure. None of these three Scandinavian countries seems to have suffered a depression due to the Black Death in the Middle Ages. Finally, we used the students\u2019 genetic data to predict their adult height after training a novel prediction algorithm on public summary statistics from large GWAS. We validated our prediction using the students\u2019 self-reported height and found that we could predict height with a remarkable ~64% accuracy.<\/span><br><br>http:\/\/www.abstractsonline.com\/Plan<wbr>\/ViewAbstract.aspx?sKey=ac1ca3bb-22<wbr>32-49e5-b2f8-4292c03316e6&amp;cKey=14dc<wbr>a6cd-3337-4e69-964b-8d8de88a982d&amp;mK<wbr>ey=724c3001-0be7-4c9f-b314-ddac3db6<wbr>fc2a","filename":"wizimir, the slayer of Danes","ext":".jpg","w":435,"h":640,"tn_w":84,"tn_h":125,"tim":1491390672939,"time":1491390672,"md5":"6us8TPW7d75LYsi3Kwd5oA==","fsize":177827,"resto":119593246,"id":"sV5kuEqc","country":"PL","country_name":"Poland"},{"no":119595775,"now":"04\/05\/17(Wed)07:11:37","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119594780\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119594780<\/a><br>Pic related?","filename":"theking","ext":".png","w":660,"h":393,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":74,"tim":1491390697877,"time":1491390697,"md5":"PpNwrVg\/+gK+vQYkxozghw==","fsize":380756,"resto":119593246,"id":"25Q0TsKb","country":"IT","country_name":"Italy"},{"no":119595800,"now":"04\/05\/17(Wed)07:11:59","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119595106\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119595106<\/a><br>I know its wiki sources but i cant bother <br>https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Abort<wbr>ion_in_Russia#Statistics<br>Hiv<br>https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/HIV\/A<wbr>IDS_in_Russia<br>And muslic pop censuses vary but they are incesaing rapidly and Russia has open door policy with euroasia","time":1491390719,"resto":119593246,"id":"CFVKIiqR","country":"AT","country_name":"Austria"},{"no":119595848,"now":"04\/05\/17(Wed)07:12:40","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119593788\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119593788<\/a><br>Ethnically most Jews are European.

This general is for the discussion of Marxism-Leninism, the ideology of revolutionary socialism and communism.<br><br>Communism is the next stage of humanity following the capitalist stage.<br><br>What exactly is communism according to Marxist-Leninists:<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Communism is a stage of society in which the productive infrastructure is socially owned, and goods are produced not in order to sell for profit, but in order to meet a social need.<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Communism in it&#039;s full form is a stateless, classless society that follows the maxim &quot;From each according to their ability, to each according to their need.&quot;<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;To achieve such a society Marxism-Leninism teaches us that we must replace the capitalist state, which is controlled by the capitalist class, by a socialist state, which is controlled by the working class. Then, a period of class struggle follows in which the capitalist class is liquidated by the working class. When the capitalist class has been completely vanquished, there will be only one class, the working class, and eventually the functions of the state will become indistinguishable from the functions of the society as a whole, and the state as such will &#039;wither away&#039; as Marx said.<\/span><br>https:\/\/www.marxists.org\/archive\/ma<wbr>rx\/works\/1847\/11\/prin-com.htm<br>https:\/\/www.marxists.org\/archive\/ma<wbr>rx\/works\/1848\/communist-manifesto\/<br><br>ML uses a philosophy called dialectical materialism, see here:<br>https:\/\/www.marxists.org\/reference\/<wbr>archive\/stalin\/works\/1938\/09.htm<br><br>It is recommended that you read some of the critical works of Marxism-Leninism so you can make an informed assessment of the ideology.<br><br>Resources:<br>https:\/\/www.marxists.org\/archive\/ma<wbr>rx\/works\/sw\/<br>https:\/\/www.marxists.org\/archive\/le<wbr>nin\/works\/sw\/<br>https:\/\/www.marxists.org\/reference\/<wbr>archive\/stalin\/works\/decades-index.<wbr>htm<br>https:\/\/www.marxists.org\/reference\/<wbr>archive\/mao\/selected-works\/<br>https:\/\/www.marxists.org\/archive\/ma<wbr>rx\/works\/1884\/origin-family\/<br>https:\/\/www.marxists.org\/archive\/le<wbr>nin\/works\/1914\/mar\/11.htm","filename":"1481244074852","ext":".png","w":1010,"h":1010,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":250,"tim":1491340365839,"time":1491340365,"md5":"676S1nirnOI5InkeibSxFw==","fsize":177742,"resto":0,"id":"sarvJNSz","country":"ES","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"pol-communism-general","country_name":"Spain","replies":11,"images":7,"omitted_posts":6,"omitted_images":2},{"no":119518301,"now":"04\/04\/17(Tue)17:22:19","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119518025\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119518025<\/a><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;homeboard<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;muh safespace<\/span>","filename":"3cc3ebb542293670bbc3ba5acca29350e792642e404433ff2dafd3efbb2658ea","ext":".png","w":449,"h":401,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":111,"tim":1491340939420,"time":1491340939,"md5":"Ug3tmZKnoFn5NYQLnv8i3Q==","fsize":143448,"resto":119517154,"id":"sarvJNSz","country":"ES","country_name":"Spain"},{"no":119518590,"now":"04\/04\/17(Tue)17:24:43","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119518301\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119518301<\/a><br><br>Spainfag is the next stage of cuckoldry who follows the failed idea of communism<br><br>Who exactly is Spainfag according to everybody who sees his threads:<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Spainfag is an unemployed \/leftypol\/ drain on society who advocates for gibs cuz he is too lazy to work.

Outside of Europe, they are very popular in some South American countries, notably in Argentina and Uruguay. Electronic bidet-integrated toilets, along with functions like toilet seat warmers, are commonly found in Japan.<br>In northern Europe, bidets are rare, although in Finland bidet showers are common.[7] Bidet showers are also common in South-East Asia, South Asia and parts of the Middle East.<br>In 1980, the first &quot;paperless toilet&quot; was launched in Japan by manufacturer Toto,[8] a combination of toilet and bidet which also dries the user after washing. These combination toilet-bidets (washlet) with seat warmers, or attachable bidets are particularly popular in Japan and South Korea, found in approximately 60% of households.[citation needed] They are commonly found in hotels and even some public facilities.

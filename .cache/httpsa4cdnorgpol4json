First tranny I ever met was a guy who came out as a &quot;&quot;&quot;woman&quot;&quot;&quot; at 11. I had known him since elementary, He was extremely depressed and violent due to emotional issues. Despite acting (somewhat) like a regular guy and having been interested in girl his whole life, the creep started wearing dresses and asking to be called she. This dude had a history of playing make belive to an extreme and was also plagued with identity issues so me and my friends assumed it was just a phase. It probably would have been, but his parent and all their liberal friends intervened and start playing along, buying him makeup + dresses and eventual putting the poor guy on puberty blockers. Years later my sister starts to hang out with him again and I get to see the results of his attempt to transition. I see the guy again for the first time since 8th grade and he has these half-grown tits and a mutant looking face. To overcompensate for actually being a man the pervert wears hyper-girly all pink outfits and talks in a squeaky little girl voice. His parents turned him into a gross parody of a female, can&#039;t even look at him without feeling sick.","filename":"IMG_1822","ext":".png","w":500,"h":486,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":121,"tim":1491425927733,"time":1491425927,"md5":"zxBADdp2xkZlcl3HEkADlQ==","fsize":209122,"resto":119651458,"id":"WkC\/Xi58","country":"US","country_name":"United States"}]},{"posts":[{"no":119646299,"now":"04\/05\/17(Wed)15:45:21","name":"Anonymous","com":"why don&#039;t we just invade syria and give it to israel?","filename":"tmp_32605-1482762526739768525715","ext":".jpg","w":1097,"h":791,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":180,"tim":1491421521850,"time":1491421521,"md5":"meOhZ2PhfNr4FBvPVeOqlg==","fsize":82753,"resto":0,"id":"MHJv66Bo","country":"US","m_img":1,"bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"why-dont-we-just-invade-syria-and-give-it-to","country_name":"United States","replies":47,"images":13,"omitted_posts":42,"omitted_images":10},{"no":119654834,"now":"04\/05\/17(Wed)16:55:17","name":"Anonymous","com":"Just think how great the Middle East would be if it was controlled by Israel.

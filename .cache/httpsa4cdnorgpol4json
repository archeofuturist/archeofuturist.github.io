If he was mad and snapped he&#039;d logically kill her and maybe her family members or one of her ex boyfriends. <br>By targeting random strangers and filming it, it strikes me as similar to a lot of the behaviors exhibited by inner city niglets where they&#039;d film themselves beating up some kid or shooting up a gas station. They do it solely for the attention, or the &quot;street cred&quot; as they would call it. They wanna look tough and stand out so senpai Crip and Blood will notice their thuggery. <br>My theory is that Joy Lane dumped his ass and called him a pussy, so he wanted to prove himself tough but also was emotionally fragile and full of dispair. This combined with overpopulated cities making the city coon see his fellow coon as nothing but another competing meat sack, led to a random murder.","filename":"22af5804c04c5f6141d127f3edce59c476ad811ed015e687dbfe467cce003c50","ext":".jpg","w":1280,"h":800,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":78,"tim":1492646290863,"time":1492646290,"md5":"9bZkBqpNTfYOrh8t4adYCw==","fsize":113512,"resto":121906985,"id":"G5E1ej9k","country":"US","m_img":1,"country_name":"United States"}]},{"posts":[{"no":121918267,"now":"04\/19\/17(Wed)19:51:22","name":"Anonymous","sub":"wtf no laugh at Sweden thread?","com":"HAHAHAHHAHAHA.<br><br>Ohhhh shit.<br><br>HAHHAHAHAHAHHAHAHAHA.","filename":"1486316057411","ext":".jpg","w":490,"h":275,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":140,"tim":1492645882517,"time":1492645882,"md5":"EWK0bNH4N9BNtjbcf\/xyHQ==","fsize":71117,"resto":0,"id":"CPYsqEgO","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"wtf-no-laugh-at-sweden-thread","country_name":"United States","replies":6,"images":4,"omitted_posts":1,"omitted_images":1},{"no":121918544,"now":"04\/19\/17(Wed)19:53:29","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121918267\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121918267<\/a><br>HOLY FUCK!<br>HAHHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA<br>Swedecucks lol!","filename":"192837732","ext":".png","w":812,"h":727,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":111,"tim":1492646009760,"time":1492646009,"md5":"3xkDmYnXkq2Bc9bBEegwuw==","fsize":29032,"resto":121918267,"id":"hLZTWiK7","country":"CA","country_name":"Canada"},{"no":121918792,"now":"04\/19\/17(Wed)19:55:28","name":"Anonymous","com":"HAHAHAHHAHAHA.<br><br>Ohhhh shit.<br><br>HAHHAHAHAHAHHAHAHAHA.","filename":"america turns into brazil","ext":".jpg","w":2500,"h":2000,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":100,"tim":1492646128597,"time":1492646128,"md5":"z0MJl9PXnKK3MGcD16Vn1g==","fsize":1503129,"resto":121918267,"id":"HJBzEty5","country":"DE","m_img":1,"country_name":"Germany"},{"no":121918913,"now":"04\/19\/17(Wed)19:56:29","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121918792\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121918792<\/a><br>daily reminder that germany and thus the german &quot;people&quot; are doing this to europe as well","time":1492646189,"resto":121918267,"id":"QFeDQdF4","country":"NL","country_name":"Netherlands"},{"no":121919142,"now":"04\/19\/17(Wed)19:58:10","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121918792\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121918792<\/a>","filename":"1489951333106","ext":".gif","w":280,"h":203,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":90,"tim":1492646290229,"time":1492646290,"md5":"ZGuVZdlpBXv6SazkmTP17w==","fsize":1031978,"resto":121918267,"id":"eDZXAxLI","country":"SE","country_name":"Sweden"},{"no":121919243,"now":"04\/19\/17(Wed)19:58:52","name":"Anonymous","filename":"1490326105078","ext":".png","w":588,"h":411,"tn_w":124,"tn_h":87,"tim":1492646332570,"time":1492646332,"md5":"0SwuX57kmN93+xnOo3XSGg==","fsize":376124,"resto":121918267,"id":"CPYsqEgO","country":"US","country_name":"United States"}]}]}

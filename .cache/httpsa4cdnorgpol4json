Some people said that the key, or parts of the key to some wikileaks insurance files were indeed found but stopped cold. <br><br>Whenever this topic is brought up, it is usually heavily attacked. Attacked to a point that is a little strange.

Any good links for further info? Supposedly investigations are still happening underground and as far away as possible from government scrutiny as possible.

Its when you think of nothing but acquiring money. Its when you believe morals are relative, and nature has no moral consequential bounds. That is Satanism. Satanism is the worship of the self. It is the number 9. It is a man who can never admit he was wrong, and wants to control other things and peoples, because he has no control of his base desires. It is the worship of pleasure and self, the desire to be a ruler in hell. Satanism uses occult knowledge of higher principles so that when people discover the occult through Satanism, they think its bad, instead of realizing the darkness can only copy the light and twist it to their sick energy. The occult is like a hand, it can be used to lovingly roll dough, or it can be used to punch out the throat and end a life. It is a tool. Remember, no matter who tells you otherwise, God has a set of fixed, immutable, eternal law, and that is objective moral integrity.","time":1493822295,"resto":123877924,"id":"T+\/dArzL","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":123918088,"now":"05\/03\/17(Wed)10:40:50","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123898442\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123898442<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;mfw this is me<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;mfw i told my schizophrenic mom about pizza gate and she hasnt been the same since<\/span>","time":1493822450,"resto":123877924,"id":"rdmsGm2H","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":123918168,"now":"05\/03\/17(Wed)10:41:34","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123913131\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123913131<\/a><br>Bump","time":1493822494,"resto":123877924,"id":"o8CPFvs9","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":123918362,"now":"05\/03\/17(Wed)10:43:36","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123917850\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123917850<\/a><br>read","filename":"ACIM-3rdEd_HC-wSeal_large","ext":".jpg","w":428,"h":480,"tn_w":111,"tn_h":125,"tim":1493822616925,"time":1493822616,"md5":"jPXkVZxi6gtwDlTfYAOHtw==","fsize":30027,"resto":123877924,"id":"3xqbIz4h","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"}]},{"posts":[{"no":123898166,"now":"05\/03\/17(Wed)06:24:42","name":"Anonymous","sub":"The latest viral media psy-op, thanks Heineken!","com":"So, \/pol\/ what do you think??<br><br>https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=8wY<wbr>Xw4K0A3g<br><br>I mean, you just need to talk to liberals and you&#039;ll realize how intolerant and wrong you are.

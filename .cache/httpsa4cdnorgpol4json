Aliens are us from the future (that&#039;s not it)<br>They are in contact with our leaders of today (still not it) Get ready<br>They have told our leaders that in thousands of years they have still not been able to achieve immortality and through trying to achieve this, destroyed their dna to the point they can no longer reproduce. They were forced into cloning and even that has a shelf life. The problem is genetic. In their past the races didn&#039;t mix. The white race continued to dominate and eventually went to the stars, leaving the others behind. They tried to go back and integrate dna from the lower races but by that time the species gap was way to vast. So they came back in time to get these genes integrated naturally. The integration of other races is a percentage thing. There is a tipping point. A point that cannot be exceeded in order to preserve the genes that are desired. At some point multiculturalism will be abandoned so that these genes will dominate while still preserving archaic genes they believe will help in preserving the ability to reproduce and ultimately help achieve immortality. Their species, in their timeline is already doomed. They cannot return to their timeline after coming back. Just by coming back they have created an alternate timeline, ours. But they can still escape to our future. Which they will once they are sure the job is done.

There\u2019s a problem, though: It might not help. Research suggests that most people don\u2019t choose lighter meals after seeing calorie information on menus. Many consumers don\u2019t even notice it.<br><br>Restaurants, meanwhile, have learned to game the system, highlighting their lowest-calorie options \u2014 like salads without dressing \u2014 to improve their numbers. And it\u2019s hard to be precise about calorie counts, raising questions about how useful the data are in the first place.<br><br>But there\u2019s reason to believe the requirements could help make Americans healthier eaters. While it might not change a diner\u2019s mind as he or she considers a menu board, it might inspire a healthier choice later, or the diner might head to a different restaurant the next time, and that possibility is motivating restaurants to make changes.<br><br>While chains have been reluctant to touch popular menu items for fear of turning off their regulars, the new requirements have prompted them to add healthier options.

However, we are dealing with stupendously large amounts of time in regards to the evolution of the eye. When the eye first developed, it was very rudimentary and you could think of it as only being able to sense light and darkness but no images. Eventually due to mutations and natural selection, the eye developed into a more cup like structure which improved the senses. Over and over it changed until the eye could actually have images. The better you can see the more likely it is you can avoid predators and seek out sustenance. <br><br>It&#039;s hard to grasp huge numbers like billions or even just millions of years. It&#039;s an insanely large amount of time. Think about how many things can happen in such radically long periods! All the mutations, and the trillions and trillions and trillions and trillions of the reactions of chemicals and cells and etc etc etc. <br><br>At a glance, the eye definitely seems engineered but when you get into the evidence and start to get how long it took for the eye to evolve etc it makes sense how it could have happened.","time":1490983121,"resto":119063694,"id":"x\/MvePVK","country":"US","country_name":"United States"}]},{"posts":[{"no":119062847,"now":"03\/31\/17(Fri)10:54:36","name":"Anonymous","com":"Why are Republicans suddenly so opposed to internet privacy?

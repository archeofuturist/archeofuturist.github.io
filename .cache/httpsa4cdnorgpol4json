Apparently AI scientists or whatever also use it, but I hate it. I can&#039;t deny that it makes learning to program easy, though.<\/span><br> - Pros: easy to learn, from your first &quot;Hello world&quot; program to advanced programming concepts. Can be used for any level project, although it&#039;s less popular in professional application (but more popular in more scientific-oriented applications).<br> - Cons: I absolutely despise its syntax. It&#039;s also relatively different to &quot;normal&quot; C-style languages; if you grasp programming concepts well learning a new syntax should be easy, but will still take some getting used to.<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Javascript: the obvious (and practically only) choice for web development. However, I&#039;d advise learning the language first; once you can program well, you could start building websites, because really that&#039;s two different skills.<\/span><br> - Pros: insanely popular right now, useful for web development, heck you can make an entire website (including serverside and even database) in javascript using something like the MEAN stack.<br> - Cons: it&#039;s a very forgiving language; the original vision was that it would be used for 10-line scripts embedded in HTML website pages. Of course it&#039;s evolved a lot since then, but things like dynamic loose typing make it easy to screw up if you&#039;re attempting a larger project.<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;C#: It&#039;s like Java but better. I&#039;m sure you know what java is.<\/span><br> - Pros: Out of these three languages, it&#039;s the most non-meme one. It&#039;s developed by a large organisation, has a lot of features, proper object orientation, etc. etc. In my opinion, it&#039;s the best &quot;traditional&quot; language out there. Also unlike Java it&#039;s actually well-designed for the most part so if you try to learn to program in C#, you&#039;ll actually learn to program, not learn how to deal with Java&#039;s shittier aspects.","time":1490221761,"resto":117828398,"id":"psWVD+rG","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"}]},{"posts":[{"no":117827506,"now":"03\/22\/17(Wed)17:15:44","name":"Anonymous","com":"The only problem with interracial relationships are the ones that don&#039;t end in a long-lasting &quot;till death do us part&quot; marriage.<br><br>That&#039;s the problem with white women getting blacked, not that they&#039;re having sex with black men, but that black men don&#039;t settle down get married and stay married for the rest of their life with ANY woman, black OR white. <br><br>The issue has never truly been about race, it&#039;s been about the degradation of marriage.","filename":"IMG_5083","ext":".jpg","w":362,"h":362,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":250,"tim":1490217344344,"time":1490217344,"md5":"zR6NUaE5cEQ9X15cPy\/ffQ==","fsize":44012,"resto":0,"id":"c78fw5IG","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"the-only-problem-with-interracial-relationships","country_name":"United States","replies":28,"images":8,"omitted_posts":23,"omitted_images":6},{"no":117837045,"now":"03\/22\/17(Wed)18:16:06","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p117831198\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;117831198<\/a><br><a href=\"#p117832261\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;117832261<\/a><br><br>the fact that she is with a niggers proves she is worthless<br><br>you will never have a girl of any value because the act of going with a nigger erases her value<br><br>Theres a reason porn stars want 3 times as much to fuck niggers, because they know people lose interest in them afterwards <br><br>p.s the reason we dont say it to your face is because the government is keeping you monkeys as pets, not because you are some tough guy","time":1490220966,"resto":117827506,"id":"NS9geHWa","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":117837162,"now":"03\/22\/17(Wed)18:16:50","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p117828423\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;117828423<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Implying there are not black people smarter then you...<\/span>","time":1490221010,"resto":117827506,"id":"GOEFyLc0","country":"BR","country_name":"Brazil"},{"no":117838126,"now":"03\/22\/17(Wed)18:23:16","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p117837162\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;117837162<\/a><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;implying regression to the mean isnt a genuine phenomenon <\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;implying regression to the mean doesnt render that point moot<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;implying there are actually any significant number of niggers smarter than me anyway<\/span><br><br>If you discount halfies and quadroons\/other mixes its unlikely ill ever run into a nigger smarter than I am in any regard","time":1490221396,"resto":117827506,"id":"NS9geHWa","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":117838920,"now":"03\/22\/17(Wed)18:28:36","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p117838126\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;117838126<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;hubris<\/span>","time":1490221716,"resto":117827506,"id":"c78fw5IG","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":117839020,"now":"03\/22\/17(Wed)18:29:17","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p117827506\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;117827506<\/a><br>Sorry, you&#039;re still a mongrel","time":1490221757,"resto":117827506,"id":"ZHzkSxCR","country":"BR","country_name":"Brazil"}]},{"posts":[{"no":117819992,"now":"03\/22\/17(Wed)16:28:04","name":"Nathan Bedford Forrest","sub":"True Capitalist Radio hosted by Ghost - episode #475 if digits CIA will kill the show again","com":"http:\/\/www.blogtalkradio.com\/ghost\/<wbr>2017\/03\/22\/true-capitalist-radio-ho<wbr>sted-by-ghost--episode-475<br><br>Markets fall flat after yesterday&#039;s contraction.

According to Giuseppe Sergi, the Mediterranean race was the &quot;greatest race of the world&quot; and was singularly responsible for the most accomplished civilisations of ancient times, including those of Mesopotamia, Persia, Egypt, Greece, Phoenicia, Carthage, and Rome. The Mediterranean race was also a major influence to the outside world in the modern era: Portugal established the first global empire in history, during the 16th century, followed contemporary by Spain, setting both nations in the highest dominion of political and economics powers in Europe.<br><br>C. G. Seligman also stated that &quot;it must, I think, be recognised that the Mediterranean race has actually more achievements to its credit than any other race, since it is responsible for by far the greater part of Mediterranean civilisation, certainly before 1000 BC (and probably much later), and so shaped not only the Aegean cultures, but those of Western as well as the greater part of Eastern Mediterranean lands, while the culture of their near relatives, the Hamitic pre-dynastic Egyptians, formed the basis of that of Egypt.&quot;<br><br>The Nazis explained this away by claiming that the elite warriors of the aristocracy of Ancient Greece, of Ancient Rome, and of the Spanish Empire and Portuguese Empire were Nordic Aryans who had migrated south. However, they did admit that those of the Mediterranean race in general and notably such geniuses of the Mediterranean race as Dante Alighieri, Michelangelo, Andrea Palladio, Galileo Galilei, Enrico Fermi and Leonardo da Vinci tended to be more creative than Nordics.","filename":"w","ext":".png","w":1000,"h":657,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":164,"tim":1490214887595,"time":1490214887,"md5":"evjkl+d+V1SuhuaY4p85Gw==","fsize":197515,"resto":0,"id":"0R4+v82C","country":"PT","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"the-fact-that-the-mediterranean-race-is","country_name":"Portugal","replies":64,"images":22,"omitted_posts":59,"omitted_images":20},{"no":117837753,"now":"03\/22\/17(Wed)18:20:51","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p117837316\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;117837316<\/a><br>Germanics saved western europe, you should be a lil less cocky there pablo.<br><br>http:\/\/www.eupedia.com\/europe\/frank<wbr>ish_influence_modern_europe.shtml","time":1490221251,"resto":117821061,"id":"kxuG00GG","country":"KW","country_name":"Kuwait"},{"no":117838332,"now":"03\/22\/17(Wed)18:24:31","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p117837170\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;117837170<\/a><br>100% white absolutely zero chink blood only ever have seen 2 chinks in my life plus the epidemic you&#039;re thinking of in eastern Canada is chink women marrying white males<br><br>We don&#039;t all live in Toronto","filename":"image","ext":".jpg","w":3264,"h":2448,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":93,"tim":1490221471621,"time":1490221471,"md5":"V\/3WTkzJQrE98ChF6GTF7A==","fsize":1609691,"resto":117821061,"id":"8Fn8FNET","country":"CA","m_img":1,"country_name":"Canada"},{"no":117838810,"now":"03\/22\/17(Wed)18:27:50","name":"Anonymous","com":"The Frankish influence over Europe was so important from the Merovingian period onwards that the term for &#039;European&#039; or &#039;non-Muslim&#039; became (and remains up to this day) Faranji in Arabic and Farangi in Persian, a derivative of the word &quot;Frank&quot;.

I don&#039;t have any ready myself but it is important to question everything even something accepted as true and taught in public schools. The statement is very likely true, however; &quot;continuous&quot; could mean a small number of ships maybe 10-20 travelling back forth across the ocean for a century. Given the distance of the trip and the ships they used at the time its possible that the slaves only account for 1-2% of the American population at the time. I did pull all of those numbers out of my ass just now but I&#039;m trying to show you that if you just think about it for a minute you can see why you shouldn&#039;t automatically dismiss the possibility that black slaves were only 1-2% population as well as the possibility there may have been more white slaves than blacks. You&#039;re outlook is very blue-pilled. You were told slaves were shipped here continuously and you interpreted that to mean it was the largest slave trade of the time (it wasn&#039;t).

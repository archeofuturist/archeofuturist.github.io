Gen. Paul Van Riper<br>Red, commanded by retired Marine Corps Lieutenant General Paul K. Van Riper, adopted an asymmetric strategy, in particular, using old methods to evade Blue&#039;s sophisticated electronic surveillance network. Van Riper used motorcycle messengers to transmit orders to front-line troops and World-War-II-style light signals to launch airplanes without radio communications.<br><br>Red received an ultimatum from Blue, essentially a surrender document, demanding a response within 24 hours. Thus warned of Blue&#039;s approach, Red used a fleet of small boats to determine the position of Blue&#039;s fleet by the second day of the exercise. In a preemptive strike, Red launched a massive salvo of cruise missiles that overwhelmed the Blue forces&#039; electronic sensors and destroyed sixteen warships. This included one aircraft carrier, ten cruisers and five of six amphibious ships. An equivalent success in a real conflict would have resulted in the deaths of over 20,000 service personnel. Soon after the cruise missile offensive, another significant portion of Blue&#039;s navy was &quot;sunk&quot; by an armada of small Red boats, which carried out both conventional and suicide attacks that capitalized on Blue&#039;s inability to detect them as well as expected.<br><br>At this point, the exercise was suspended, Blue&#039;s ships were &quot;re-floated&quot;, and the rules of engagement were changed; this was later justified by General Peter Pace as follows: &quot;You kill me in the first day and I sit there for the next 13 days doing nothing, or you put me back to life and you get 13 more days&#039; worth of experiment out of me.

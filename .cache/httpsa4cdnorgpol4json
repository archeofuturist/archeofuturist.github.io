I was a young CIA officer, called by September 11 to serve, and found myself amid generals and sheikhs, writing for presidents\u2014the life I\u2019d dreamed of since childhood. Drained by 18-hour days and fitful sleep, my demons flooded the moments of peace. In the dark, I heard fighting beyond the wall, thought of friends killed and wounded, and remembered my secret. You feel explosions before you hear them, and there was a bomb at the center of my life that no one could see. I was transgender, and feared I would lose my family and friendships. It was before an Executive Order protected transgender employees, and I imagined myself ridiculed or fired if I admitted the truth.

One day he decided he was now a woman\u2014hilarious I know\u2014and wanted everyone to believe him. Management didn&#039;t know what to do with the transsexual. CIA had only just accepted gays; the officer left the Agency.&quot; When I was a child I knew that trans-people existed, but I knew I couldn\u2019t possibly be one of them. I was going to make history, not be some freak on television. My self-discipline and self-hatred marched in lock-step. I bottled up my problem, and tried to live up to the CIA&#039;s values: to \u201cput mission before self\u201d and \u201cgo where others cannot.\u201d But CIA has other chiseled words: \u201cthe truth shall set you free.\u201d How could I speak truth to power but not be honest with myself?<\/span>","filename":"7606627b70eb931a50521d6b996966f638839867ba167b4b91b8ec1b6d5c061d[1]","ext":".png","w":1054,"h":806,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":191,"tim":1490088036296,"time":1490088036,"md5":"uFZI1pcXITGQVwOF\/lnC3w==","fsize":202311,"resto":0,"id":"TwCCv53O","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"wikileaks-tweets-about-the-cias-hiring-of","country_name":"United States","replies":66,"images":12,"omitted_posts":61,"omitted_images":12},{"no":117615688,"now":"03\/21\/17(Tue)07:24:36","name":"Anonymous","com":"This is just to distract from their covert monitoring program!","time":1490095476,"resto":117608399,"id":"ktjYVIAr","country":"NZ","country_name":"New Zealand"},{"no":117615769,"now":"03\/21\/17(Tue)07:25:58","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p117610521\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;117610521<\/a><br><a href=\"#p117611081\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;117611081<\/a><br>The level of truth in these posts is epic.","time":1490095558,"resto":117608399,"id":"jACXbl7q","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":117616366,"now":"03\/21\/17(Tue)07:35:34","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p117611259\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;117611259<\/a><br>Christ Vlad, he&#039;s already Brazilian, how much more punishment can he take?","time":1490096134,"resto":117608399,"id":"E+ISo\/VI","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":117616496,"now":"03\/21\/17(Tue)07:37:31","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p117610731\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;117610731<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;the trap meme is an actual trap <\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;the trap is not that there&#039;s a penis, but that it gives you a mental illness, like a psychic tripwire<\/span>","time":1490096251,"resto":117608399,"id":"E+ISo\/VI","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":117616814,"now":"03\/21\/17(Tue)07:42:30","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p117609888\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;117609888<\/a><br>https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/channel\/UCA<wbr>gVKvt3syB7gV-hL9bMTYw","time":1490096550,"resto":117608399,"id":"i9k8cqbq","country":"US","country_name":"United States"}]},{"posts":[{"no":117602023,"now":"03\/21\/17(Tue)03:39:15","name":"Anonymous","com":"can we just gas these people already?","filename":"Capture","ext":".png","w":646,"h":616,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":238,"tim":1490081955540,"time":1490081955,"md5":"Tz3j2v7DoMPuJDNB3JKjxQ==","fsize":473988,"resto":0,"id":"DmNXp4Xq","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"can-we-just-gas-these-people-already","country_name":"United States","replies":120,"images":23,"omitted_posts":115,"omitted_images":22,"tail_size":50},{"no":117615343,"now":"03\/21\/17(Tue)07:18:30","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p117602023\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;117602023<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;can we just gas these people already?<\/span><br><br>No, anon, we can&#039;t.

This may be in part because they approach the Islamic canonical texts, the Qur\u2019an and Hadith, essentially at face value, without any mitigating cultural prism, and those texts exhort Muslims to live according to Sharia and wage war against and subjugate Infidels under the hegemony of Sharia.<br><br>Young Rashid embarrasses the Muslims in Minneapolis, and it\u2019s easy to see why. He wears a silly \u201cReligious Police\u201d uniform. He is calling for adherence to the Sharia in ways that they are not doing. Yet his wife maintains that he \u201cloves Islam\u201d and he claims to have attracted a following of sorts: he \u201csaid he has enlisted a group of 10 men, ages 18 and 25, to help him patrol the area\u201d and make sure Sharia is being obeyed. If that claim is true, authorities would do well to reflect upon how Rashid has managed to do that. Could it be that his vision of Islam and Sharia is not as singular and strange as this Star Tribune implies it to be?<br><br>The Muslim community\u2019s opposition to him doesn\u2019t necessarily mean that they oppose Sharia or even the idea of religious police, which exist in Sharia states, notably Saudi Arabia and Iran. They just oppose this eccentric arrogating to himself that role in a place where even the existence of such a police force is not yet opportune.<br><br><br>https:\/\/www.jihadwatch.org\/2017\/04\/<wbr>minneapolis-muslim-sharia-vigilante<wbr>-aims-to-create-sharia-controlled-z<wbr>one","filename":"Screenshot_20170413-124840","ext":".png","w":1600,"h":2560,"tn_w":156,"tn_h":250,"tim":1492105815273,"time":1492105815,"md5":"t0+mt6e87WKdpnGdpEuTSw==","fsize":963734,"resto":0,"id":"T0ofMaWH","country":"US","m_img":1,"bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"minneapolis-muslim-sharia-vigilante-aims-to","country_name":"United States","replies":19,"images":1,"omitted_posts":14,"omitted_images":1},{"no":120942178,"now":"04\/13\/17(Thu)14:23:46","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120941129\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120941129<\/a><br><a href=\"#p120941141\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120941141<\/a><br><a href=\"#p120941195\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120941195<\/a><br><a href=\"#p120941406\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120941406<\/a><br><a href=\"#p120941800\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120941800<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;against degeneracy<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;against sin<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Against the government<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;pro family<\/span><br><br>This guy is so based.<br><br>Is he, dare i say, \/ourguy\/?","time":1492107826,"resto":120937775,"id":"THqCNqgI","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":120942498,"now":"04\/13\/17(Thu)14:26:21","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120942178\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120942178<\/a><br>die Scuzlim fiend","time":1492107981,"resto":120937775,"id":"LjM2h\/zO","country":"CA","country_name":"Canada"},{"no":120942806,"now":"04\/13\/17(Thu)14:28:41","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120942498\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120942498<\/a><br>You&#039;re a degenerate leaf.

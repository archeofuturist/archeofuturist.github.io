Rather, Lucifer in this context is seen as one of many morning stars, a symbol of enlightenment,[27] independence and human progression, and is often used interchangeably with similar figures from a range of ancient beliefs, such as the Greek titan Prometheus or the Jewish talmudic figure Lilith.<\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;They support the protection of the natural world. Both the arts and sciences are crucial to human development, and thus both are cherished. Luciferians think that humans should be focused on this life and how to make the most of it every single day. The ability to recognize both good and evil, to accept that all actions have consequences, both positive and negative, and to actively influence one&#039;s environment, is a key factor.<\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;For Luciferians, enlightenment is the ultimate goal. The basic Luciferian principles highlight truth and freedom of will, worshipping the inner self and one&#039;s ultimate potential. Traditional dogma is shunned as a basis for morality on the grounds that humans should not need deities or fear of eternal punishment to distinguish right from wrong and to do good. All ideas should be tested before being accepted, and even then one should remain skeptical because knowledge and understanding are fluid. Regardless of whether Lucifer is conceived of as a deity or as a mere archetype, he is a representation of ultimate knowledge and exploration: humanity&#039;s savior and a champion for continuing personal growth.<\/span><br><br>Why is this bad?","time":1493496409,"resto":123373935,"id":"D6ssIjt9","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":123375393,"now":"04\/29\/17(Sat)16:13:49","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123374532\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123374532<\/a><br>The fuck man.

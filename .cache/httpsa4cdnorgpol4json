If we had a world war tomorrow, nobody would want to fight. Nobody gives a shit. When you have nothing to die for, you have nothing to live for. People just live in America to try and make some money, live under a law system that sort of works, send their kids to an OK school, and go shopping at strip malls. This is nihilism, even if people don&#039;t know it. <br><br>Society has definitely fallen away from Christianity. Churches are corrupt with weak and cucked pastors. So even if somebody is trying to go to church, they&#039;re not getting anything out of it because the pastor is usually a massive faggot buried in debt, so he&#039;s afraid to preach anything controversial because he needs to make money. Also most Christians these days are weak pussies and they don&#039;t even know what the Bible says anymore. <br><br>Then politics just sucks. Left\/right want to kill each other and have nothing in common, and our politicians are completely corrupt. Everybody knows it too. <br><br>Art\/music\/film is just depressing. Even the underground stuff sucks. People aren&#039;t excited about it, it&#039;s just kinda... there. Metal has gone stale, rock is boring, bluegrass has gone stale, classical is a niche genre at this point, hip hop is only enjoyed by uncultured faggots and tumblrtards<br><br>Everybody knows acadamia is a scam. The teachers are lazy\/on a power trip, the curriculum is usually lame. But you need it to get a job. <br><br>Basically everything is shit, people are just kinda... floating. Theres no meaning in anything anymore. Every institution has become a joke and a laughing stock. Even marriage.","filename":"IMG_7893","ext":".jpg","w":1024,"h":633,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":154,"tim":1491990283500,"time":1491990283,"md5":"9atSNKGI8l0iZ5yp3JOmhw==","fsize":112723,"resto":0,"id":"Yx3fY9cq","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"america-in-a-nihilist-slump","country_name":"United States","replies":81,"images":13,"omitted_posts":76,"omitted_images":11},{"no":120746989,"now":"04\/12\/17(Wed)07:54:47","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120737803\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120737803<\/a><br>You know we&#039;ve been warned about this repeatedly for over 100 years?

Women are running these things or people are running these things in their favour and its not working for men, and so its no surprise MGTOW has come about.<br>However its not a solution. The solution is for men to be more selective with their partners and perhaps take advantage of the immigration system and marry foriegn women from cultures and societies not affected by feminism. I&#039;m not saying get an african grill but Eastern European women would be nice as well. Fact is the only way to beat this is to avoid the women who have engineered this system, and perhaps over time we can swing things back away from gynocentrism but for now we have to work with what we have. As well men should employ traditional values and raise their children to understand that something is wrong with society, if enough people do this the next generation will vote in majority over those raised by feminists (considering that they have fewer kids and get avoided for breeding). That and men need to raise their daughters telling them that is bad to be a stripper, whore, porn star, etc, and that they have to choose between a family or a career, and a family will probably make them happier. When these women say &quot;Waaah but I want to do both.&quot; You simply tell them tough shit thats life, get over it. Women need to get raised understanding that they can&#039;t have it all and must be mothers and wives for society to flourish, them wanting to pursue a career they will probably not be successful in is irrelevant. Tough love is what the average woman needs. But until we can vote out and right the wrongs feminists have done in government, we have to make decisions at our level and make solid families and raise good children. <br>TLDR: Fuck feminism, but also fuck MGTOW.

And when I said about that exposed weakness I meant, that they will use any means possible to fuck it up further. So if the balkanization becomes as possible, everyone who holds a grudge against US (almost everybody) will spill some more fuel into the rising fire one way or another, either financial and international support or weapons not available to civies (Launchers, Manpads etc, like Taliban insurgents or any other freedom fighting organization around the world really) and instructors when things get really heated. Because again, you already have a precedents of mostly US backed NGOs that destabilize situations in countries around the globe under the guise of keeping democracy and protecting citizens from oppressive government then following it up with arming various rebel groups. And the most ironic and probable outcome would be, that this thing will happen in the US by the exactly same guidelines.","time":1491998026,"resto":120738870,"id":"gMCVmvg0","country":"CZ","country_name":"Czech Republic"},{"no":120747004,"now":"04\/12\/17(Wed)07:54:55","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120746864\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120746864<\/a><br>To prevent, I never said it worked effectively","time":1491998095,"resto":120738870,"id":"xuldPCzB","country":"AU","country_name":"Australia"},{"no":120747057,"now":"04\/12\/17(Wed)07:55:32","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120739577\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120739577<\/a><br>That isn&#039;t much different from using a flamethrower on a tunnel.","time":1491998132,"resto":120738870,"id":"YCl+QCEU","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":120747268,"now":"04\/12\/17(Wed)07:58:00","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120746777\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120746777<\/a><br>a cuck is a cuck. he should have hid his power level","time":1491998280,"resto":120738870,"id":"BdEk+UoB","country":"PT","country_name":"Portugal"}]},{"posts":[{"no":120719670,"now":"04\/12\/17(Wed)01:32:42","name":"Anonymous","sub":"Students &#039;fear&#039; Chick-fil-A will jeopardize &#039;safe place&#039;","com":"http:\/\/www.campusreform.org\/?ID=903<wbr>5","filename":"chick","ext":".jpg","w":400,"h":287,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":179,"tim":1491975162595,"time":1491975162,"md5":"RkAp4nfJ0\/MgnHRWpi+O1A==","fsize":17635,"resto":0,"id":"4fs1ZQx\/","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"students-fear-chickfila-will-jeopardize-safe","country_name":"United States","replies":289,"images":42,"omitted_posts":284,"omitted_images":42,"tail_size":50},{"no":120743972,"now":"04\/12\/17(Wed)07:15:17","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120743612\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120743612<\/a><br><br>Yes there are some in the DC area.

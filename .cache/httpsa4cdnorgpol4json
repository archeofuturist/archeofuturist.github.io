All it&#039;s going to do is just make attaining Freedom - not &quot;liberty&quot;, but real, tenable freedom, i.e. having strong agency over your own life - so expensive that the vast majority of the population won&#039;t be able to afford it.<br>We&#039;ve been seeing the affordability of Freedom slowly get worn down over the past 3-4 decades already. This process is only going to accelerate as overpopulation and ever-increasing migration keeps wrecking havoc on strained resource networks. <br><br>Without drastic change, war or revolution, by 2020 over half the &quot;first world&quot; population will be wage slaves, if they aren&#039;t already. By 2050 that number will climb to over 90%.<br>It will be digital feudalism. The cyberpunk dystopia is real.<br><br><br>The growth of a new super-wealthy is not an evil development. It is the logical conclusion to the circumstances. As resources get scarcer, elites will attempt to use their influence to horde what little there&#039;s left to horde. The difficulties of the growing lower classes will be compounded by their increasing irrelevancy in the new world order. Elites will only require a relatively small number highly educated workers to provide them with their services, the rest of the population are an unfortunate dead weight.<br><br>Altruistic attempts to help the poor or wealth-redistribution schemes concocted by revolutionary forces would both be fruitless. These will only reveal the uncomfortable reality of too little material wealth spread across far too many people.<br>This is the long-term failure of humanitarianism and liberalism. Dreams of unlimited growth are shattered as they are hit with the harshness of physically limited resources and a practical limit to technological progress.<br><br>So stock up, boys. If you are under, say, 30, you were born just in time to see the great crash. Not quite the end of civilization - but definitely the end of a golden age in human history.","filename":"IT&#039;S HOPELESS","ext":".png","w":510,"h":531,"tn_w":240,"tn_h":249,"tim":1493106176462,"time":1493106176,"md5":"QW1umqY8Oy9WxOV0tZo9iA==","fsize":227842,"resto":0,"id":"QvbqusVV","country":"IL","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"global-warming-isnt-going-to-wipe-humanity-all","country_name":"Israel","replies":1,"images":0},{"no":122710311,"now":"04\/25\/17(Tue)03:58:19","com":"<a href=\"#p122709214\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122709214<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Elites will only require a relatively small number highly educated workers to provide them with their services, the rest of the population are an unfortunate dead weight.<\/span><br><br>And yet the elite keep making more and more of these so called &quot;Dead Weight&quot; with entitlement programs that reward them for breeding...<br><br>Really makes you think.","time":1493107099,"resto":122709214,"id":"J3wfW9Z\/","country":"US","trip":"!niqjediPCA","country_name":"United States"}]},{"posts":[{"no":122687339,"now":"04\/24\/17(Mon)23:41:29","name":"The Sage King","sub":"\/nsg\/ \u5350 - National Socialism General","com":"\u5350 SIEG HEIL! \u5350<br> <br>Thread for discussion of National Socialism, Fascism, Traditionalism, and European Identity Movements.

front of the IRS headquarter. you see for once he 2 pillars boaz and jachin, symbolizing the sun and the moon, famous freemason imagery. also probably representing the 2 temples (like the twintowers were too)that got destroyed on tisha bav, a jewish holiday associated with destruction of their 2 temples and other misfortunes. the 2 pillars are seperated in 13 parts, 13, always associated with bad luck. valley of Hinnom is mentioned 13 times in the bible, this is where the place was for important rituals to moloch. nimrod, the great hunter, founder of what later became known of babylon, our first civilization where he ruled as king. nimrod was 13th in line of ham, son of noah who survived the flood. nimrod was said to stood before god, as in being on the same level of him or taking his place (hence why all governments are satanic. the pillars are black and white, symbolizing the duality of good and evil, as above so below etc. with the hands doing the as above so below gesture even.<br><br>about the pyramid. in ancient times it was believed gods lived on mountains, so they build their own mountain, a zyggurath like the tower of babylon was, on which the man that became god resides on top and oversees his realm with his allseeing eye symbolized by the capstone. it also symbolizes hierachy.<br>on this pyramid there is written on the black part &quot;we the people&quot; together with the rest of the constitution. above it, the capstone completely seperated from the normal plebs, and the rules of the constitution the elite, the men who think of them as god.","filename":"IRS building

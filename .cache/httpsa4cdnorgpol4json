One of the ways we could fix this is to make it easier for Europeans to become citizens. This along with raising the white birth rate and lowering non-white birth rates. Could make America become at least 80% white in the next 50 years. <br><br>Trump has recently stated he will be replacing the current immigration act with a merit based system. Hopefully this could make it somewhat easier for Europeans to come here as it will be far more difficult for non-whites to enter the country. <br><br>The ones that would move here would be the ones that supported populist parties or are against their marxist leaders. The Lefty loons would most likely stay back in Europe to get raped by hordes of shitskins. <br><br>Europeans are more likely to have children in America as there&#039;s more room to start families in. This could raise the white birth rate higher which will keep America from becoming Brazil 2.0. Hopefully Trump can also allow white south Africans to flee here as well. <br><br>I want to see what euroanons think about this, Specifically the ones that want to move.

It starts in relation to the world war.<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Nobody realized that European man was possessed by something that robbed him of all free will. And this state of unconscious possession will continue undeterred until we Europeans become seared of our &quot;god-almightiness.&quot; Such a change can begin only with individuals, for the masses are blind brutes, as we know to our cost. It seems to me of some importance, therefore, that a few individuals, or people individually, should being to understand that there are contents which do not belong to the ego-personality, but must ascribed to a psychic non-ego. This mental operation has to be undertaken if we want to avoid a threatening inflation. To help us, we have the useful and edifying models held up to us by poets and philosophers-models or archetypi that we may well call remedies for both men and the times. Of course, what we discover there is nothing that can be held up to the masses-only some hidden thing that we can hold up to ourselves in solitude and in silence. Very few people care to know anything about this, it is so much easier to preach the universal panacea to everybody else than to take it oneself, and, as we all know, things are never so bad when everybody is in the same boat. No doubts can exist in the herd; the bigger the crowd the better the truth-and the greater the catastrophe.<\/span><br><br>To make a long story short, and to borrow a phrase from Peterson, sort yourself out.

Lines have been drawn in the sand by both sides involved that will inevitably intersect and lead to open conflict. <br><br>The Cause:<br>The United States of America was founded on traditions, ideals and principles of Freedom. All nations are in their own way great, but America is the greatest not because of it&#039;s military conquests or later economic power, but because its foundation gave the ordinary person something he had never had in the history of mankind: actual freedom and equality under the law.<br><br>Recognizing this there will always be a small, hardcore group of American citizens that value their Rights and Freedoms, and can point to countless irrefutable documented facts of powerful forces attempting to subvert those very Freedoms to pursue their own agenda.<br><br>At some point the tyranny will become too much, a series of Waco-like events perpetrated by the outlaw government will set the country into war. The enemy knows this, which is why there hasn&#039;t been anything like Waco since.<br><br>The Sides:<br>In all likelihood it will be Patriot Militias fighting a guerilla warfare strategy against tyrannical government forces possibly even with NATO help. There is rumored to be a proper command system in place for the Patriot side called the Second Continental Army of the Republic or S.C.A.R. This military organization is said to be staffed by competent ex high ranking US military members. The only way to join S.C.A.R. is by invitation only, after exhaustive intelligence gathering on said unit. The best and most serious militia units are those not known to the media or authorities. <br><br>The Outcome:<br>If the Patriots win the civil war, which will be very long and costly, then humanity has a chance at restoring the Constitution of the United States and all the principles it stands for. This means over 90% of all laws would be repealed. There will be no welfare of any kind. There will be no subsidies for industries of any kind.","filename":"3904823084","ext":".jpg","w":550,"h":367,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":166,"tim":1491254767498,"time":1491254767,"md5":"eChtzPEMLuc3MoOp6QnNCw==","fsize":57150,"resto":0,"id":"c3bqYasc","country":"CA","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"2nd-us-civil-war-is-inevitable","country_name":"Canada","replies":3,"images":0},{"no":119383130,"now":"04\/03\/17(Mon)17:27:21","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119382990\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119382990<\/a><br>Well hurry it the fuck up.

Sure it\u00b4s fun portraying Sweden as an almost failed state with no turning back, inhibited by nothing but cucks and women wanting to be impregnated by arabs and blacks. The truth however is that there is a large group of people that arent amused at all and youll notice if you talk to young Swedes aged 20-35. We cannot hide in gated communities as the older and richer people can and we have a harder time finding decent jobs. At the same time we have almost no political or social influence meaning that our voices and opinions are suppressed. The msm and politicians are spending tremendous amounts of money and time to stop any organized resistance. I believe there will be a backlash and some nasty times in a few years.

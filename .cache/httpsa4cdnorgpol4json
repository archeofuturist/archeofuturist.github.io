HUGE NASA COVERUP!","com":"NASA has built a device, an Artificial Sun\/Simulator Reflector and placed it heliosynchronis in orbit outside the Earth&#039;s Atmosphere. NASA technology is very highly advanced and they are able to cloak (hide) objects in outer space including our Solar Sun. Our Solar Sun is not white but yellow in its appearance. The device is about the size of a football field that unfolded after being launch into space. It is white and very very bright. Because the device is so close to the Earth and infront of our Solar Sun it is cloaking (hiding) our Solar Sun. It also bends light like a Prism and here is how to prove it. If you follow this procedure you will see both suns (Our Solar Sun and the Artificial Sun) at the same time. You will need two (2) pairs of UV Sunglasses. UV Sunglasses with a upper tinted lenses work excellent. 1.) Place 1 pair of sunglasses on and close 1 eye. 2.)WHILE LOOKING AT THE SUN, hold the other pair of sunglasses 10 inches in front of the other pair (look on the upper tinted area of the lense). Slowly bring the second pair closer towards your face like a telescope. You will see two suns. 1 sun will be bright white; that is the Artificial Sun\/Simulator Reflector. The other sun, which is our Solar Sun will not be as bright and will appear to be a different color depending on the tinted color on the sunglass lense. Our Solar Sun is 93 Million Miles behind the device. If you do this technique correctly, you will see two suns WITH YOUR OWN EYES; the Artificial Sun and our Solar Sun.

I&#039;ve always heard stories about miracles and whatnot, but I never witnessed one. Until that day. There was a site across the street, a close friend of my father bought it. He wanted to build up a lumber businnes there. Of course, they needed something to defend the wood they were storing there. And this &quot;something&quot; was a dog. Not too big, pretty small in fact, but it was agressive as it barked at everything and everyone. One day, me and my father went there for a little chit-chat. I asked about the dog&#039;s name. It was &quot;Laci&quot;. He asked me if I wanted to pet him. I said of course, but on the other hand, I was a little bit afraid (I was 11-12 at best at the time). As we walked up to the animal, I realized that I was standing on the dog&#039;s chain. I didn&#039;t know why was it important then, since my mind started arguing with itself on whether I should step down or should I stay on the chain. I mean, something like this? Why would something like this be that important for me? After that little argument in my head (which was no longer that 1 or 2 seconds), I finally came to the conclusion that I should release the poor animal. And then I heard a voice in my head saying &quot;Put it back down&quot;. Without hesitation, I put my feet down on the chain. I&#039;m still sure that this voice was my guardian angel. As I was petting the dog, suddenly, from the nowhere, it jumped into my face with open mouth. Only a few inches separated my face from the dog&#039;s jaws. And after that sudden moment, I heard whining. As it turned out, the dog was stopped by the chain. The same chain I was standing on.","time":1492219536,"resto":121128445,"id":"EcnIXTX9","country":"HU","country_name":"Hungary"},{"no":121147173,"now":"04\/14\/17(Fri)21:26:15","name":"Anonymous","com":"Friendly reminder that Israel\/CIA\/Shariablue create religious threads in an attempt to cause infighting among us.

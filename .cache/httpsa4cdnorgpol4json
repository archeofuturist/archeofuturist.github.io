It&#039;s not a major problem so far, but when I grew up there it was like 100% white. <br><br>Every part of Wisconsin is pretty different from the other. South\/Eastern Wisconsin near Milwaukee\/Kenosha is basically a suburb of Chicago. I don&#039;t really like it that region too much. <br><br>I&#039;m from Northern Wisconsin which is gorgeous, but jobs are a problem. Most people do \/out\/ shit on the weekends up there or buy a cabin. If you can get a job anywhere up in that region, that&#039;s pretty ideal. It&#039;s really desolate and beautiful. <br><br>Western Wisconsin like the Madison area is really nice, probably the best region to live in. Obviously Madison is extremely liberal though, so that&#039;s a bit of a problem. If you can live in one of the towns outside of Madison, that&#039;s nice. The landscape is gorgeous too out there, lots of rolling hills. Look up &quot;Wisconsin Driftless Region&quot; to see what I mean. <br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;cultural problems<\/span><br><br>Alcoholism. Wisconsin is the #1 consumer of alchohol in the USA. Wisconsinites are proud of it and think it&#039;s cute, but I think it&#039;s fucking retarded. People don&#039;t get enough shit accomplished and party too hard. This sometimes makes the state depressing to live in. The alcoholism also means a lot of people are fat and ugly. <br><br>Overall, I&#039;d sum up the state by saying that people are easy-going, petty, depressed, but like to party hard. It&#039;s very desolate, cold, and quiet most of the time. <br><br>There&#039;s definitely a sense of freedom here too. Not quite on the level of Wyoming, but there is a sense that you can do anything and not be bothered by cops or whatever. <br><br>Like I said, the state has some problems. Economically and culturally, but I&#039;d rather live in Wisconsin than 80% of the states I&#039;ve been to.","time":1491348486,"resto":119496091,"id":"EzmD\/qnK","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":119533748,"now":"04\/04\/17(Tue)19:28:52","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119533280\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119533280<\/a><br><br>There&#039;s all kinds of explanations, David himself doesn&#039;t go near them though.

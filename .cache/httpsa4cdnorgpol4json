Marble is used to hamper forensic investigators and anti-virus companies from attributing viruses, trojans and hacking attacks to the CIA.<br><br>Marble does this by hiding (&quot;obfuscating&quot;) text fragments used in CIA malware from visual inspection. This is the digital equivallent of a specalized CIA tool to place covers over the english language text on U.S. produced weapons systems before giving them to insurgents secretly backed by the CIA.<br><br>Marble forms part of the CIA&#039;s anti-forensics approach and the CIA&#039;s Core Library of malware code. It is &quot;[D]esigned to allow for flexible and easy-to-use obfuscation&quot; as &quot;string obfuscation algorithms (especially those that are unique) are often used to link malware to a specific developer or development shop.&quot;<br><br>The Marble source code also includes a deobfuscator to reverse CIA text obfuscation. Combined with the revealed obfuscation techniques, a pattern or signature emerges which can assist forensic investigators attribute previous hacking attacks and viruses to the CIA. Marble was in use at the CIA during 2016. It reached 1.0 in 2015.<br><br>The source code shows that Marble has test examples not just in English but also in Chinese, Russian, Korean, Arabic and Farsi. This would permit a forensic attribution double game, for example by pretending that the spoken language of the malware creator was not American English, but Chinese, but then showing attempts to conceal the use of Chinese, drawing forensic investigators even more strongly to the wrong conclusion, --- but there are other possibilities, such as hiding fake error messages.<br><br>The Marble Framework is used for obfuscation only and does not contain any vulnerabilties or exploits by itself.","filename":"Fe00yVS2_400x400","ext":".png","w":400,"h":400,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":250,"tim":1490956183551,"time":1490956183,"md5":"EXL00NLW0xS+Jz8\/v95Tgw==","fsize":84650,"resto":0,"id":"w0sxDoUs","country":"GB","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"release-cia-vault-7-part-3-marble","country_name":"United Kingdom","replies":131,"images":50,"omitted_posts":126,"omitted_images":49,"tail_size":50},{"no":119066838,"now":"03\/31\/17(Fri)11:40:44","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119065547\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119065547<\/a><br>Just looked it up.<br><br>A method to summarize non-linear associations.<br><br>That&#039;s the perfect phrase -- non-linear associations.

Hyperrealist painters and sculptors use photographic images as a reference source from which to create a more definitive and detailed rendering, one that often, unlike Photorealism, is narrative and emotive in its depictions. Strict Photorealist painters tended to imitate photographic images, omitting or abstracting certain finite detail to maintain a consistent over-all pictorial design. They often omitted human emotion, political value, and narrative elements. Since it evolved from Pop Art, the photorealistic style of painting was uniquely tight, precise, and sharply mechanical with an emphasis on mundane, everyday imagery.<\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Hyperrealism, although photographic in essence, often entails a softer, much more complex focus on the subject depicted, presenting it as a living, tangible object. These objects and scenes in Hyperrealism paintings and sculptures are meticulously detailed to create the illusion of a reality not seen in the original photo. That is not to say they&#039;re surreal, as the illusion is a convincing depiction of (simulated) reality. Textures, surfaces, lighting effects, and shadows appear clearer and more distinct than the reference photo or even the actual subject itself.<\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Hyperrealism has its roots in the philosophy of Jean Baudrillard, &quot;the simulation of something which never really existed.&quot; As such, Hyperrealists create a false reality, a convincing illusion based on a simulation of reality, the digital photograph. Hyperreal paintings and sculptures are an outgrowth of extremely high-resolution images produced by digital cameras and displayed on computers. As Photorealism emulated analog photography, Hyperrealism uses digital imagery and expands on it to create a new sense of reality.

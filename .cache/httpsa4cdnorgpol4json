All trade entered a Rome trading post and very little petty cash \/ gold was maintained on site. All trade, from metal to grain was settled in a major Rome trading House. <br>- A modern example would be no matter where you were in NATO, you would have to open a banking account with The Clinton Foundation, and hope Bill Clinton did not take your funds for his personal project. They usually did back then. Local Slavs &amp; Hun tribes didn&#039;t like that much.<br>- After the fall of the roman empire, Rome pulled back the troops, leaving villages and clans to fend for themselves. Nobles, made up of ex-Roman Equines (Knights) became the Deminse and defenders of their old realms. <br>- To prevent 1 or more Deminse from making a cartel and racketeering other nobles (and their communities) the church deemed loan sharking &amp; highway tolls illegal. Jewish merchants stepped in to finance illegal good fencing from merchant bandits, and loan goods out at high rates.<br>- The middle ages had a bad 40 year &quot;dry spell&quot; and crop yields fell. Economies stagnated, much like today after the Clinton &quot;Subprime Depression&quot;. <br>- Laid off people and poor knights got angry<br>- Some turned to robbery and slavery. Leading to raids from 400-700 AD. <br>- After 2 generations of raids, local knights told the Jewish banking clans to BTFO and decided to set up credit unions. They had their own handshakes, their own code and their own enclaves. Think Proto-Bitcoin &amp; Proto-internet Clans.<br>- Jews and their Debitor Kings got upset and tried to outlaw Monestary Finance which was a direct competition to the Ursary banking practices in Amsterdam and Italy.<br>- People in the Balkans and Spainish Moores realized the Knights were good &amp; fair, bound by their oaths to a moral code and would work with debitors to build communities, protect roads &amp; make irrigation systems vs. the banditry &amp; confiscation of the Merchant Cartel.<br>(want to know more Y\/N ?)","filename":"Dalmatia","ext":".jpg","w":214,"h":236,"tn_w":214,"tn_h":236,"tim":1490664476893,"time":1490664476,"md5":"BFjA\/r6HfHty1leb0H8t9A==","fsize":14477,"resto":0,"id":"BIfe1hmX","country":"CA","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"deus-vult-red-label-finely-aged-redpills","country_name":"Canada","replies":0,"images":0}]},{"posts":[{"no":118592184,"now":"03\/27\/17(Mon)21:27:55","name":"Anonymous","sub":"What do legitimate Trump supporters who have legitimate issues with him do on here?","com":"Since you have to love every single thing he does or you&#039;ll be called a shill.","filename":"Q","ext":".jpg","w":1797,"h":1960,"tn_w":229,"tn_h":250,"tim":1490664475277,"time":1490664475,"md5":"IiAgkxCxbRK9qOXpQK4nBA==","fsize":190925,"resto":0,"id":"OC8PsR37","country":"KR","m_img":1,"bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"what-do-legitimate-trump-supporters-who-have","country_name":"South Korea","replies":1,"images":1},{"no":118592403,"now":"03\/27\/17(Mon)21:30:02","name":"Anonymous","com":"Here&#039;s an example.

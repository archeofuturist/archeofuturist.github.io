Legalizing a mildly psychoactive plant isn&#039;t going to change society in any way whatsoever, except of course create a new industry. <br><br>Marijuana is one of the safest mind altering substances on Earth. It is physically impossible to overdose on, there has never been one recorded death that has been directly contributed to marijuana&#039;s use. <br><br>Anyone who is against legalization is therefore supporting the actions of drug cartels, and is literally human garbage.

This general is for the discussion of Marxism-Leninism, the ideology of revolutionary socialism and communism.<br><br>Communism is the next stage of humanity following the capitalist stage.<br><br>What exactly is communism according to Marxist-Leninists:<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Communism is a stage of society in which the productive infrastructure is socially owned, and goods are produced not in order to sell for profit, but in order to meet a social need.<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Communism in it&#039;s full form is a stateless, classless society that follows the maxim &quot;From each according to their ability, to each according to their need.&quot;<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;To achieve such a society Marxism-Leninism teaches us that we must replace the capitalist state, which is controlled by the capitalist class, by a socialist state, which is controlled by the working class. Then, a period of class struggle follows in which the capitalist class is liquidated by the working class. When the capitalist class has been completely vanquished, there will be only one class, the working class, and eventually the functions of the state will become indistinguishable from the functions of the society as a whole, and the state as such will &#039;wither away&#039; as Marx said.<\/span><br>https:\/\/www.marxists.org\/archive\/ma<wbr>rx\/works\/1847\/11\/prin-com.htm<br>https:\/\/www.marxists.org\/archive\/ma<wbr>rx\/works\/1848\/communist-manifesto\/<br><br>ML uses a philosophy called dialectical materialism, see here:<br>https:\/\/www.marxists.org\/reference\/<wbr>archive\/stalin\/works\/1938\/09.htm<br><br>It is recommended that you read some of the critical works of Marxism-Leninism so you can make an informed assessment of the ideology.<br><br>Resources:<br>https:\/\/www.marxists.org\/archive\/ma<wbr>rx\/works\/sw\/<br>https:\/\/www.marxists.org\/archive\/le<wbr>nin\/works\/sw\/<br>https:\/\/www.marxists.org\/reference\/<wbr>archive\/stalin\/works\/decades-index.<wbr>htm<br>https:\/\/www.marxists.org\/reference\/<wbr>archive\/mao\/selected-works\/<br>https:\/\/www.marxists.org\/archive\/ma<wbr>rx\/works\/1884\/origin-family\/<br>https:\/\/www.marxists.org\/archive\/le<wbr>nin\/works\/1914\/mar\/11.htm","filename":"1481244074852","ext":".png","w":1010,"h":1010,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":250,"tim":1492943112484,"time":1492943112,"md5":"676S1nirnOI5InkeibSxFw==","fsize":177742,"resto":0,"id":"Xff2KsBw","country":"ES","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"pol-communism-general","country_name":"Spain","replies":109,"images":44,"omitted_posts":104,"omitted_images":40,"tail_size":50},{"no":122421765,"now":"04\/23\/17(Sun)09:09:53","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122407705\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122407705<\/a><br>I&#039;m so sick of capitalists pigs I want to bash the fash and size the man&#039;s production help me achieve equality anon","time":1492952993,"resto":122407705,"id":"LA9Hj6y5","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":122421995,"now":"04\/23\/17(Sun)09:12:00","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122407705\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122407705<\/a><br>I don&#039;t like to work<br>Communism: those with skill -&gt; those in need<br>Seem pretty good","time":1492953120,"resto":122407705,"id":"TCFw9XOY","country":"BR","country_name":"Brazil"},{"no":122422132,"now":"04\/23\/17(Sun)09:13:29","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122407705\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122407705<\/a><br>all we have to know is that it failed every time it was enforced.","time":1492953209,"resto":122407705,"id":"JiWfc3P6","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":122422168,"now":"04\/23\/17(Sun)09:13:51","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122421744\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122421744<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;&gt;If communism is for the people, then why must it silence the people in order to succeed?<\/span><br><br>Context, mate. &quot;The people&quot; should be read as &quot;The Chosen&quot; in the first sentence, and &quot;Christians&quot; in the second.","time":1492953231,"resto":122407705,"id":"Tmto7izy","country":"AU","country_name":"Australia"},{"no":122423542,"now":"04\/23\/17(Sun)09:27:52","name":"Anonymous","com":"<span class=\"quote\">&gt;Antifa commies in America accusing Russia of tampering and influencing an election against their interests<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Russian pres is ex kgb<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;minority of 37% should dictate over the 63% <\/span><br><br>What world would do we live in anons?

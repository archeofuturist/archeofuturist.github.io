The females believe that the statistically average white man is their rival (because they were excluded and humiliated from his &quot;tribe&quot; since they were ugly\/fat) and in an attempt to ensure that they are not alone in the open (which means their genes going extinct) a mechanism is triggered where the entire psychology of the females screams at them to find an alternative RIGHT NOW regardless of how illogical it is.<br><br>The best way to imagine this is to imagine the reason such behavior would&#039;ve evolved in a tribe of primal humans. You have tribe A and B, with polarized cultures, next to eachother. Tribe A slutshames and excommunicates a group of females, technically eliminating them from the genepool. How do those females reproduce to ensure survival of their genes? They adopt an anti-A mentality so they can flip to the opposite tribe B and have it welcome them. That&#039;s why the majority of feminists are either ugly, fat, or insufferable cunts no male would want to be near - their genetic flaws got them excommunicated from the civilized world that wants nothing to do with them so they seek an alternative.<br><br>This is why a pro-female rights activist allies with and campaigns for even MORE of anti-feminist muslims - the end goal of those feminists is to reproduce with them, not to further the feminist movement. The feminist movement is just a group they have attached themselves to so they can achieve their reproductive goals, and will ditch the moment that happens. <br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Fun fact: if you can meme that refugees find feminists repulsive and would rather behead them than fuck them, the entire pro-immigration mentality of the 21st century will vanish and feminists will adopt a conservative housewife stance to appeal to the other non-mainstream tribe of females - the virgins<\/span>","filename":"freud","ext":".jpg","w":1412,"h":2000,"tn_w":88,"tn_h":125,"tim":1491946924688,"time":1491946924,"md5":"WWnic1NumIIovlnXtLVcgw==","fsize":650958,"resto":120657329,"id":"0CMdKh2n","country":"BG","m_img":1,"country_name":"Bulgaria"},{"no":120662265,"now":"04\/11\/17(Tue)17:42:40","name":"Anonymous","com":"It&#039;s like pottery.","filename":"thefuck","ext":".png","w":615,"h":606,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":123,"tim":1491946960351,"time":1491946960,"md5":"zaNNpYq8dxg8mU7GWH7yEQ==","fsize":202376,"resto":120657329,"id":"gYiA3Yk3","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":120662286,"now":"04\/11\/17(Tue)17:42:48","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120662191\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120662191<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;mainstream tribe of females - the virgins<\/span><br>tribe of males*","time":1491946968,"resto":120657329,"id":"0CMdKh2n","country":"BG","country_name":"Bulgaria"},{"no":120662434,"now":"04\/11\/17(Tue)17:43:59","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120657329\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120657329<\/a><br>Women&#039;s suffrage was a fucking mistake.<br>When this all crashes and burns, fucking remember the mistake of letting women decide anything.","filename":"women vote","ext":".png","w":1500,"h":3719,"tn_w":50,"tn_h":125,"tim":1491947039476,"time":1491947039,"md5":"ciSY0W8u+5dERCyzmMn8TA==","fsize":608996,"resto":120657329,"id":"twOHlooL","country":"FI","m_img":1,"country_name":"Finland"},{"no":120662453,"now":"04\/11\/17(Tue)17:44:08","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120657329\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120657329<\/a><br>The problem will cure itself naturally--when they realize they will have to sleep in the bed they made<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;just don&#039;t be a cuck and take them back<\/span>","time":1491947048,"resto":120657329,"id":"XfVDM\/qd","country":"US","country_name":"United States"}]},{"posts":[{"no":120662450,"now":"04\/11\/17(Tue)17:44:06","name":"Anonymous","com":"Why is degeneracy being pushed throughout every media platform?<br><br>Whats the endgame? <br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=yG<wbr>oEXfLMnWc<\/span>","filename":"Transgender spaceman","ext":".png","w":1430,"h":956,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":167,"tim":1491947046789,"time":1491947046,"md5":"gRw+hPrD\/wY2mvcApEW0Lg==","fsize":1454698,"resto":0,"id":"ly2h1loy","country":"DK","m_img":1,"bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"why-is-degeneracy-being-pushed-throughout-every","country_name":"Denmark","replies":0,"images":0}]},{"posts":[{"no":120662449,"now":"04\/11\/17(Tue)17:44:06","name":"Anonymous","sub":"Why Should Religion Be Allowed?","com":"Religion holds back science, progress, liberalism, gay trans rights, everything good.

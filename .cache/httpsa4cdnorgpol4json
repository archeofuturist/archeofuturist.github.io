Klumpf will get impeached any second now. It&#039;s just a matter of time.<br><br>Even \/pol\/, which makes up about 95,3% of his supporters, according to Nate Silver has turned on him. He&#039;s not getting the nuclear codes anymore. He&#039;ll have the nuclear codes taken away from him any second now. <br><br>I even heard from sources that there are people on their way to take away the nuclear codes from wummpf as we speak.","time":1491857950,"resto":120489919,"id":"W0s+guoV","country":"CA","country_name":"Canada"}]},{"posts":[{"no":120482237,"now":"04\/10\/17(Mon)16:01:34","name":"Anonymous","sub":"New thread","filename":"risk4","ext":".png","w":2132,"h":1560,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":182,"tim":1491854494537,"time":1491854494,"md5":"p+XNqQRScsi3VrszG2aoQA==","fsize":392494,"resto":0,"id":"cA96ks74","country":"BR","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"new-thread","country_name":"Brazil","replies":59,"images":7,"omitted_posts":54,"omitted_images":7},{"no":120488939,"now":"04\/10\/17(Mon)16:51:29","name":"Kekistan +31 | Allied: Fronce+Ukraine","com":"<a href=\"#p120488894\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120488894<\/a><br>AGAIN WTF","filename":"1491855941660","ext":".png","w":2132,"h":1560,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":91,"tim":1491857489628,"time":1491857489,"md5":"M8xHXLpL2u2NXTW9DoK1KA==","fsize":267874,"resto":120482237,"id":"4KX5mmpT","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":120489040,"now":"04\/10\/17(Mon)16:52:08","name":"Ukraine (+70) Allies w\/ Kekistan, France, and Sythica)","com":"<a href=\"#p120488939\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120488939<\/a><br>Destroy Germany in France","time":1491857528,"resto":120482237,"id":"d7jlZoxp","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":120489388,"now":"04\/10\/17(Mon)16:54:31","name":"Sythica +24 (Ally: Ukraine)","com":"<a href=\"#p120488939\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120488939<\/a><br>Invade Finland and Alands, taking bonuses first","time":1491857671,"resto":120482237,"id":"Q+OW0FQ3","country":"UA","country_name":"Ukraine"},{"no":120489594,"now":"04\/10\/17(Mon)16:55:53","name":"Ragnar Lodbrok +46","com":"<a href=\"#p120488939\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120488939<\/a><br><br>Fuck over Orange and take his shit","time":1491857753,"resto":120482237,"id":"xv9eiZrZ","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":120490059,"now":"04\/10\/17(Mon)16:59:08","name":"Sythica +24 (Ally: Ukraine)","com":"<a href=\"#p120489594\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120489594<\/a><br>Check your bonus","time":1491857948,"resto":120482237,"id":"Q+OW0FQ3","country":"UA","country_name":"Ukraine"}]},{"posts":[{"no":120486486,"now":"04\/10\/17(Mon)16:32:55","name":"Anonymous","sub":"NatSocs vs. the Alt-Right","com":"So with the recent happenings I&#039;ve noticed a stark division between the NatSocs (so-called old\/pol\/) and the Alt-Righters (so-called nu\/pol\/).

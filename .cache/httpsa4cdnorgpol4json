Bernie Sanders is not where they should be fixing their gaze. Sanders is clear that he is not a Democrat \u2014 except when he needs to be one in order to run for president. Yet he is demanding that the Democratic Party head for what Rebecca Traister last week called \u201cthird-way centrist bullshit.\u201d<br><br>Economic populism and what are commonly erroneously and dismissively referred to as \u201csocial issues\u201d \u2014 such as reproductive rights, immigration reform and civil rights for people of color, those who have disabilities, people of all faiths, LGBT people and women \u2014 are indivisible. Sanders routinely demonstrates his own lack of progressive values by dividing them.<br><br>There is no economic populism without abortion rights and civil rights. No one can have economic justice if he or she doesn\u2019t have fundamental rights. Yet Sanders has made it plain that abortion rights are negotiable and brushes off \u201cidentity politics.\u201d He consistently argues that his values \u2014 and his alone \u2014 should define what it is to be progressive. (Which can\u2019t help but remind one of Donald Trump\u2019s unilateral defining of terms.)<br><br>Further, Sanders routinely divides matters of race and gender and class \u2014 which, again, cannot be untwined \u2014 by discussing the \u201cpain\u201d and needs of working-class voters and perpetuating the dangerous myth that the Democrats have ignored them. Sanders has insisted that Democrats have failed to reach these voters, while dismissing the fact that 75 percent of working-class voters of color voted for Clinton, not Trump, last year.","filename":"a-fucking-white-male","ext":".jpg","w":620,"h":412,"tn_w":249,"tn_h":166,"tim":1493091389407,"time":1493091389,"md5":"e6fZftyzSrhaQ0w302geoA==","fsize":229028,"resto":0,"id":"Oq4T0hJQ","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"the-left-is-eating-itself-alive-yet-again","country_name":"United States","replies":30,"images":5,"omitted_posts":25,"omitted_images":5},{"no":122689699,"now":"04\/25\/17(Tue)00:04:17","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122689262\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122689262<\/a><br>Gulags are ok but I&#039;d rather see helicopter rides or a duster taken to the ol guillotine<br><br>Can we please bring back the guillotine?

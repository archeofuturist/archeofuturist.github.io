How you connected to this person like nothing else in the world, How proper love and attention allows you to have a bond with them as strong and unconditional as a dog looks at it&#039;s owner. Your wife and Husband may love you, but they may fall out of love with you. The likely hood of that with a child is rare, unless you&#039;re a truly awful shitstain of a person. Maybe before i had a child, i wouldn&#039;t understand this. But, i do now and seeing the posts from that mother is quite moving. You can call me a cuck, a pussy or whatever else immature shit you come up with. (not you OP) but you know what i mean. Until you experience the love, or even a loss like this. Nobody can imagine. It&#039;s just tragic.","time":1492593361,"resto":121800015,"id":"2OKkFEX6","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":121824921,"now":"04\/19\/17(Wed)05:19:04","name":"Anonymous","com":"ah.... just when i was having doubts.

Which is a shame, because a lot of their racial humour used to be really on point.<br><br>I&#039;ve already had the plot spoiled for me, so I have no intention of watching something that I already know is 100% about the discomfort American blacks can feel around American whites. It&#039;s an issue that&#039;s not only remote to me, but completely laughable. I read an interview with the director, and he basically explains it like that. It&#039;s not a viewpoint I have sympathy for, given that the same feeling in white people (either in America or Europe) actually DOES very often lead to horror-movie-esque murders. So niggers feeling slightly uncomfortable in suburbia because of culture shock? Fucking deal with it, you crybabies.<br><br>Oh, and a big part of the movie&#039;s plot is the implication that *sigh* white people are somehow obsessed with black people being &quot;cool&quot; and want to appropriate that for themselves.<br><br>No, niggers, we aren&#039;t interested in your magic negro bullshit. We don&#039;t think you&#039;re special, and we know the stereotypically careless black lifestyle comes hand in hand with also not caring about important stuff, which is why you complain about &quot;racism&quot; at the same time you claim white people are &quot;stiff&quot; or &quot;boring&quot;, because those attributes also make people excell in the world.<br><br>So is it well made? I&#039;d bet my left arm that it is. Entertaining to watch, too. Does it have a persistent undercurrent of bitching about nonissues in the whole black-white racial relationship in the US? From the mouth of the director: Yes. However, as I understand it, it&#039;s mostly about white liberals.

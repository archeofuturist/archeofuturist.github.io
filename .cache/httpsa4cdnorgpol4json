A word some huppelkutje named Anne Fleur also used when talking about FvD&#039;s frontman Thierry Baudet, in a prominent Dutch newspaper on Saturday. It&#039;s becoming clear FvD could still use our help (great example is SaneerMeneer&#039;s reaction video below), by refuting these lefties everywhere we can, and spread these refutals everywhere we can.

Applicants have to apply and prove that they are either receiving certain types of government benefits, such as Medicaid, or have household incomes at or below 135 percent of the poverty line.

Nor is it paid for with &quot;tax payer money,&quot; as the e-mail claims. Rather, it is funded through the Universal Service Fund, which is administered by the Universal Service Administrative Company, an independent, not-for-profit corporation set up by the Federal Communications Commission. The USF is sustained by contributions from telecommunications companies such as &quot;long distance companies, local telephone companies, wireless telephone companies, paging companies, and payphone providers.&quot; The companies often charge customers to fund their contributions in the form of a universal service fee you might see on your monthly phone bill. The fund is then parceled out to companies, such as Am\u00e9rica M\u00f3vil, that create programs, such as SafeLink, to provide telecommunications service to rural areas and low-income households.<\/span><br><br>I saw someone link the safelink website for free phones and it got me curious.

That is to say the phone service created by one company to serve one town may not have been compatible with the phone service of another company serving a different town nearby. The telecom companies themselves saw the folly in this arrangement, and so in 1913, AT&amp;T committed itself to resolving interconnection problems as part of the &quot;Kingsbury Commitment.&quot;<\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;That common goal of universal service became a goal of universal access to service when Congress passed The Telecommunications Act of 1934. The act created the FCC and also included in its preamble a promise &quot;to make available, so far as possible, to all the people of the United States, a rapid, efficient, Nation-wide, and world-wide wire and radio communication service with adequate facilities at reasonable charges.\u201d There was a fear, expressed by telecom companies themselves, that market forces alone might encourage companies to pass on providing service to hard-to-reach places. This would both hurt the people who wouldn\u2019t have service as well as existing customers who wouldn\u2019t be able to reach them. So the new FCC was tasked with promoting this principle of &quot;universal service.&quot;<\/span>","time":1490115592,"resto":117643498,"id":"XTL5y9jb","country":"US","country_name":"United States"}]},{"posts":[{"no":117635889,"now":"03\/21\/17(Tue)11:43:33","name":"FlatEarth4Lyfe","sub":"We got &#039;em boys","com":"looks like the ranks of the Flat Earthers just got a little more divers than those of the 4chan neo Nazi right <br><br>http:\/\/www.newser.com\/story\/240022\/<wbr>shaquille-oneal-is-a-flat-earther.h<wbr>tml","filename":"fdsfdsfsdfdfsd","ext":".png","w":706,"h":782,"tn_w":225,"tn_h":250,"tim":1490111013426,"time":1490111013,"md5":"kDTdF1poxL6TjIS\/0t\/P1Q==","fsize":461545,"resto":0,"id":"za0J84ba","country":"US","since4pass":2016,"bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"we-got-em-boys","trip":"!N4g1j\/gEf2","country_name":"United States","replies":98,"images":35,"omitted_posts":93,"omitted_images":34},{"no":117643196,"now":"03\/21\/17(Tue)12:55:56","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p117639432\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;117639432<\/a><br><br>Induction coils dog.. uses intense electrical field to heat metal efficiently and with convinient isolation of heat.

The producers despite their liberal perspective had to actually go out the way to find dissenting, not approving reactions from the public. They wanted to make the minority look stupid and out-of-touch only to find hey were the majority and the leftists whinging about it were the out-of-touch looking ones. <br><br>But it&#039;s the German gift and curse of obienence and being followers rather than leaders. They wait for the right time rather than start chimping and rebelling like Anglos as soon as you give us something to rebel against. Find the right person with enough charisma to lead them and they&#039;ll fall in line. Until then you&#039;ll just see cynicism and apathy. People need to see for themselves that things have really changed and it&#039;s not just a shit-test and then you&#039;ll see people&#039;s real colours. AfD to most is probably just a shit test they don&#039;t trust, they need something more convincing and authentic. <br><br>But Le Pen anyway is the real conclusion of the democracy vs. revolt question.

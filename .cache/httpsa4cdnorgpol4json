For about the last 800 years or so if you got extra cash you bought land with it. Traditionally the first thing the chinese do with excess income is buy land. In china land is valued by the structures on it and how many floors they have so they buy some trashy lot and construct a cheap shell as many floors as they can, then set on it hoping to sell it later. (Its a huuuuuge bubble in china right now, cities are surrounded by empty neighborhoods of uninhabitable building shells)<br><br>If they get wealthy enough theres a big perception that west = high class, so if they can afford to they repeat thier impulsive land buying in western countries. <br><br>They buy houses here as a substitute for a bank account because if things go to shit in china and they lose everything they can sell the property in the west and have wealth available their government cant confiscate or hyper inflate. <br><br>Those arent chinese owned houses, those are chinese saving accounts.","time":1491635284,"resto":120079542,"id":"5AqInvgp","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":120102539,"now":"04\/08\/17(Sat)03:09:06","name":"xX420BLAZEDYOLOGODXx","com":"<a href=\"#p120079542\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120079542<\/a><br>they basically sold out their kids future before even having them.","filename":"asianGIRLvsWHITEwoman","ext":".jpg","w":1064,"h":732,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":85,"tim":1491635346959,"time":1491635346,"md5":"qNuM5wocoGRU0CUn6bZPkw==","fsize":175536,"resto":120079542,"id":"qIRNOo2Q","country":"AU","m_img":1,"country_name":"Australia"},{"no":120102661,"now":"04\/08\/17(Sat)03:10:54","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120081608\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120081608<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;eventually this pyramid scheme will collapse.<\/span><br><br>Can&#039;t wait.","time":1491635454,"resto":120079542,"id":"J7x1XNcc","country":"NZ","country_name":"New Zealand"},{"no":120102774,"now":"04\/08\/17(Sat)03:12:22","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120102428\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120102428<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;If they get wealthy enough theres a big perception that west = high class, so if they can afford to they repeat thier impulsive land buying in western countries.<\/span><br>can confirm, this also makes home ownership for actual australians a literal pipe dream. at least until we introduce some more stringent regulations and tax them more as they&#039;ve done in vancouver.","time":1491635542,"resto":120079542,"id":"SRaX6V7W","country":"AU","country_name":"Australia"}]},{"posts":[{"no":120090922,"now":"04\/08\/17(Sat)01:13:20","name":"Anonymous","sub":"This is the evil dictator","filename":"IMG_0347","ext":".jpg","w":640,"h":360,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":140,"tim":1491628400099,"time":1491628400,"md5":"uneS1YmIJUVWnA7wu0mxKA==","fsize":49176,"resto":0,"id":"JaAjodwN","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"this-is-the-evil-dictator","country_name":"United States","replies":80,"images":36,"omitted_posts":75,"omitted_images":31},{"no":120102259,"now":"04\/08\/17(Sat)03:05:45","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120091408\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120091408<\/a><br>Yea you dumb fuck. <br>He looks like a rich piece of shit.<br>If you love him so much, move to Syria and suck his dick.","time":1491635145,"resto":120090922,"id":"KtSiw8xU","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":120102414,"now":"04\/08\/17(Sat)03:07:52","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120102259\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120102259<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;It&#039;s not OK to be rich unless you&#039;re a kike<\/span>","filename":"1461127439856","ext":".png","w":500,"h":337,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":84,"tim":1491635272598,"time":1491635272,"md5":"Efx2Y+9pZ3xwH539ziV8Yg==","fsize":83611,"resto":120090922,"id":"5DEXYgpY","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":120102444,"now":"04\/08\/17(Sat)03:08:11","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120101914\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120101914<\/a><br>I hope it works out for them.","time":1491635291,"resto":120090922,"id":"zpTQd6m4","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":120102504,"now":"04\/08\/17(Sat)03:08:53","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120102414\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120102414<\/a><br>I was a child once too","time":1491635333,"resto":120090922,"id":"KtSiw8xU","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":120102765,"now":"04\/08\/17(Sat)03:11:54","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120102444\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120102444<\/a><br>Digits have blessed this union.

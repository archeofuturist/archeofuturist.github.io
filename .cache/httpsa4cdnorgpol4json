The idea that true AI can build technology and think for itself is far from being real or even being a concept that could be toyed with scientifically. I think robotics will be a big issue and there will be a big problem with jobs that will be resolved as you said by universal income. But what you&#039;re missing is that it is too late to revolt, if some great secret plan is really happening we are powerless to stop it, the amount of power and stigma against conspiracies and peoples aversion to associating or indulging is such fantasies leads people to not fall in line to participate in revolution or revolt. This may be a result of media brainwashing in some degree but I just think as a result of the amount of crazy that people are exposed to on the internet via Youtube people have just become desensitised to conspiracy. The war is already won, in the hearts and the minds of the people, and the power is already in the hands of the people who are plotting, revolution is too slow and too weak. It would play out like a hollywood movie where the robocops curfew us and just kill antifa-gs.

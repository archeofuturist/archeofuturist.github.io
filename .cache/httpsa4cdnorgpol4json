But guns are not allowed on college campuses. Leave your gun at home. There will likely be fights. Boys will have your back at all times. A shooting justified or not will hurt everything we are trying to do.<br><br>3. No crazy signs. Memes are fine. But try to keep it topical to free speech on colleges , anti communism , and anti antifa. Stuff that people will see on the news and agree with.<br><br>4. Bring medical supplies to help your friends out. Stuff like gauze and whole milk for pepper spray (and chugging infront of minorities). baking soda and water is great for pepper spray too. So is maalox. If you want to go full prepper and bring your EMS bag its up to you.<br><br>5. Have fun, bring\/make friends, and get phone numbers.

For those who don&#039;t know what is happening, there is a game for depressive kids becoming very popular in countries like Russia, Ukraine, Belarus and Brazil. The game consists of an online game in which participants are purportedly assigned a curator who provides various acts of self-harm to be committed over the course of 50 days. On the final day, participants are urged to win the game by committing suicide. <br>When a person wants to play, this person must post some certain hashtags on her social media and then a &quot;curator&quot; finds them and starts to provides horror videos and stuff that will make the player wants to kill himself.

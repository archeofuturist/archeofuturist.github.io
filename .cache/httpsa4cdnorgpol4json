Recently this has begun to change, with young &quot;nipsters&quot; embracing causes such as animal rights and environmentalism alongside historically far right positions, including anti-immigration views. Nipsters, rather than rejecting modern pop culture, seek instead to hijack it to promote neo-Nazi ideals.[1] This has also been seen in the New Right and National Anarchism movements.<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Rolling Stone magazine profiled Patrick Schroeder, one of the founders of the nipster movement, who said he desires to &quot;give the German National Socialist movement a friendlier, hipper face&quot;. Schroeder says that neo-Nazis who can &quot;live within the mainstream&quot;, such as nipsters, are &quot;the future of the movement&quot;.[1] Social networking websites like Tumblr frequently host nipster content, and at least one vegan neo-Nazi cooking show, called Balaclava K\u00fcche, exists.[2] A video showing a young neo-Nazi dancing to the Harlem Shake gained over 17,000 views on YouTube between 2013 and 2014.[1] There are neo-Nazi hip-hop and reggae bands such as MaKss Damage and Mr. Bond.<\/span><br><br>https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Nipst<wbr>er","filename":"1491200911316","ext":".jpg","w":1374,"h":1425,"tn_w":241,"tn_h":250,"tim":1493805329157,"time":1493805329,"md5":"KbkqD2JxTQDkIt0vwnp2Gg==","fsize":400688,"resto":0,"id":"pU2J5Y9x","country":"EE","m_img":1,"bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"is-pol-actually-just-a-bunch-of-hipster-neonazis","country_name":"Estonia","replies":25,"images":9,"omitted_posts":20,"omitted_images":7},{"no":123898250,"now":"05\/03\/17(Wed)06:26:05","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123898200\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123898200<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt; mfw<\/span>","filename":"268457887011962880","ext":".png","w":90,"h":128,"tn_w":87,"tn_h":125,"tim":1493807165053,"time":1493807165,"md5":"4zVzG5CsVUH2xzPiH3GGhg==","fsize":18082,"resto":123896380,"id":"nWVC6Cjn","country":"EE","country_name":"Estonia"},{"no":123898253,"now":"05\/03\/17(Wed)06:26:06","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123896380\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123896380<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Is \/pol\/ actually just a bunch of hipster neo-nazis? <\/span><br><br>Yes <br>Free Palestine!","filename":"1437091376642","ext":".jpg","w":900,"h":1666,"tn_w":67,"tn_h":124,"tim":1493807166621,"time":1493807166,"md5":"Pg3hWnU4bAJ5vQwVj+Jwlg==","fsize":233808,"resto":123896380,"id":"HmK+CWKt","country":"ZA","m_img":1,"country_name":"South Africa"},{"no":123898274,"now":"05\/03\/17(Wed)06:26:23","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123896380\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123896380<\/a><br>i think pol is about jews<br><br>jews forcing single moms, racial mixing, rap music, all the degenerate shit you see in the memes<br><br>its just boring and very predictable how you globalist israeli faggots wanna stir up the pot.

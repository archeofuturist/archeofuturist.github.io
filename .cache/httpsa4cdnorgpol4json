And in fact, would probably make you ineligible to vote.<br><br>Say you were given a standardized IQ test periodically throughout your life. Let&#039;s say, you were given three. One when you are a child, one when you turn 18, and one when you&#039;re 40 (roughly the time plasticity has waned and crystallization sets in fully). <br><br>You score less than 100 when you&#039;re a kid, but no big deal, you&#039;ll learn and do better when you&#039;re older. There&#039;s a reason why testing for children versus testing for adults is different. So you take another test when you&#039;re 18 and hit 100 - flat on the nose. After the rigorous test, it is found that 100 is the maximum you will ever be able to score (since variables exist, and 100 is the highest recorded in your tests). This allows you to vote, great.<br><br>However, when you&#039;re 40 - they do another assessment. Now if you know anything about how IQ is accounted for, you&#039;ll know what is going to happen. Since it is clear that you don&#039;t - what is going to happen is that upon being retested your maximum highest score is below 100 now. <br><br>But how? Well, it&#039;s a mixture of biological reasons as well as how we actually score intelligence. Essentially, the bar is continuously increased and we adjust for this increase. It&#039;s why Anti-Death Penalty groups will go around and test every inmate on death row throughout their entire time on death row. Because in 1970 they might have had an IQ of 80, which would allow them to be executed for their crimes but in 2017 when given the test again they scored 65. This makes them ineligible for execution by the state. <br><br>The same thing happens to literally every human on earth. It isn&#039;t that you become stupid as time goes on (not really, but sort of), it is that we reassess the metrics that determine the final score. So inevitably most people would never be allowed to vote or would only be allowed to vote for relatively short period of time.","time":1493785681,"resto":123869519,"id":"lplEkEd3","country":"US","country_name":"United States"}]}]}

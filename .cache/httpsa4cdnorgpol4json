They do toss out a couple of conjectures they consider reasonable. The first is that rapists target women who are particularly fertile based on factors such as beauty and age. The second is that women unconsciously \u201cbroadcast cues about their ovulatory status that men are capable of registering and interpreting.\u201d These hypothetical unconscious cues could be physiological (e.g. body odor, subtle changes in skin tone) or behavioral.

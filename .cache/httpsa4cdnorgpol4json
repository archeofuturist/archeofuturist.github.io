When the capitalist class has been completely vanquished, there will be only one class, the working class, and eventually the functions of the state will become indistinguishable from the functions of

Try to bring it up as much as possible in as many ways as possible. You can trigger people by posting with the &quot;anarcho-feminist&quot; flag. The best way to D&amp;C is to bring up subjects like immigration, feminism, etc... etc...<br><br>3) The mods really hate national-bolsheviks and Strasserists. Mainly because they see them as a threat. The reason being that these particular ideologies are very worker oriented but are also redpilled when it comes to nationalism and immigration. It&#039;s also a good way drop subtle redpills over there. You can also post with the tankie flag for a similar effect.<br><br>4) Be sure to exploit the divide between Marxists and anarchists. They generally don&#039;t like each other too much. Explain the need for a state if you&#039;re posing as a Marxist and be sure to insult anarchists as much as possible.

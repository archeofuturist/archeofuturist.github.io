But the main reason is that huge swaths of interior land are ignored. Everyone wants to live on the coast. And large sections of that coast are set aside as state or local parks\/preserves. So there is a self imposed limit on housing, in addition to zoning ordinances and the increased cost of earthquake proofing. Most of the people moving in from out of state are older folks from New England who don&#039;t want to shovel snow another winter.","time":1492451669,"resto":121549459,"id":"6Yj8DVzQ","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":121555674,"now":"04\/17\/17(Mon)13:56:35","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121549459\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121549459<\/a><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;affluent<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;$80k median income<\/span>","filename":"Screen Shot 2017-04-10 at 3.36.25 PM","ext":".png","w":251,"h":234,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":116,"tim":1492451795891,"time":1492451795,"md5":"cNp4wxeuPuiPHeZBGCMUcg==","fsize":85578,"resto":121549459,"id":"cMNPzZ1d","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":121555807,"now":"04\/17\/17(Mon)13:57:35","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121555419\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121555419<\/a><br>Well, I happen to live in a town that is part of the Phoenix Metro. <br><br>I&#039;m personally not a fan of coasts\/oceans, so I guess it works out for me.

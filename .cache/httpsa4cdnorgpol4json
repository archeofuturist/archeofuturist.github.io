It would cut our costs of going to orbit from about $2000\/kg to about $1\/kg. There are individual asteroids that have tens of trillions of dollars in materials on them that could be mined. One mission could easily pay for the cost of building the Orbital Ring.<br><br>We could then deploy solar power satellites in orbit above cloud cover and return the power back to the surface with near zero loss by running power transmission cables down the elevator, and sell the power at a profit.<br><br>With increased luminosity in space, enhanced exposure time, and the ability to deliver base loads, solar panels pay for themselves in only 1-2 years while having a 20 year life time.<br><br>In other words, if you put $5 trillion of solar panels into space, you get your $5 trillion back by the end of year two and a $5 trillion income stream each year thereafter.<br><br>In other words, the US could cut everyone&#039;s taxes, both personal and business, income, capital, death, or otherwise, all to 0%, not even cut any benefits or current spending, and pay off the national debt within a decade.","filename":"Jeb","ext":".jpg","w":596,"h":444,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":186,"tim":1491671445653,"time":1491671445,"md5":"9zHxpj+Php+keXrd+F4OWQ==","fsize":85686,"resto":0,"id":"zC2VNgb0","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"trump-build-the-space-elevator-or-youre-gonna","country_name":"United States","replies":51,"images":14,"omitted_posts":46,"omitted_images":12},{"no":120170848,"now":"04\/08\/17(Sat)15:27:26","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120170639\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120170639<\/a><br>Where is High Level Insider\/FBIanon to prove how much a dork you are OP?","time":1491679646,"resto":120154568,"id":"zw6rwSjP","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":120171483,"now":"04\/08\/17(Sat)15:32:09","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120170639\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120170639<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;You&#039;re going to convince the people stuck on foodstamps, flipping burgers\/working at Walmart, and don&#039;t even understand what a diploma is of something they don&#039;t understand?<\/span><br><br>Yes.

But his &quot;many peace offers&quot; revisionists like to remind us were not worth the paper they were written on given this track record, and Winston Churchill, unlike Joseph Stalin, did not fall for them. Stalin did, and how did history reward him for trusting Hitler? Operation Barbarossa, the largest motorized land invasion in the history of mankind that ended up costing over 20 million Soviet lives, and two poorly sourced novels trying to make a quick buck off people 50 years later claiming Hitler&#039;s goal of destroying &quot;Judeo-Bolshevism&quot; was but a pre-emptive strike to an invasion of Europe planned by Stalin. Keep in mind the guy had trouble gaining ground in Finland.<br><br>Finally, let&#039;s address the question revisionists ask regarding the hypocrisy of Britain and France, given that they did not declare war on the Soviet Union when she invaded Poland two weeks after Hitler did. Let me begin by saying the Soviet Union was not part of the Allied powers until Operation Barbarossa, so &quot;letting an allied power get away with something&quot; is not the answer. Rather, given that Britain and France had already committed themselves to war with a European superpower and Poland was all but overrun, it would have made little sense to declare war on the largest nation on the planet on top of that as well. A bit like committing to challenging a 6 foot bully to a fist-fight but realizing there&#039;s an 8 foot bully nearby beating someone else up as well. In the end, when that bully got attacked by this bully, he was considered a friend until the first bully was brought down. Then a cold war ensued with the surviving bully. <br><br>Cont.","filename":"1488662823847","ext":".jpg","w":700,"h":776,"tn_w":112,"tn_h":125,"tim":1491680297610,"time":1491680297,"md5":"+vddVctcH4YB4N7ELjhbtQ==","fsize":210406,"resto":120170207,"id":"bglzQHbQ","country":"IE","country_name":"Ireland"},{"no":120172393,"now":"04\/08\/17(Sat)15:39:06","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120171860\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120171860<\/a><br>Hitler wasn&#039;t the only national socialist.","filename":"61defd2bf25f16916b5280c190b055e6","ext":".jpg","w":1280,"h":923,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":90,"tim":1491680346264,"time":1491680346,"md5":"2wfI+ioLDfkPZM1a7qX3Zg==","fsize":266565,"resto":120170207,"id":"PY9Z79xB","country":"CL","m_img":1,"country_name":"Chile"},{"no":120172425,"now":"04\/08\/17(Sat)15:39:20","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120172175\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120172175<\/a><br>This <br><br><a href=\"#p120172289\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120172289<\/a><br>Cont.<br><br>The only legitimate question then, is how Britain and France would have acted, had the opposite been the case: the Soviet Union invading Poland first, and Nazi Germany two weeks later.

The answer is no: there was a legal loop-hole that meant the treaty was mostly tailored to respond to German aggression. The idea of the Soviet Union invading Poland, and nothing happening as a result, and then Hitler invading to take back Danzig, and having Britain and France declare war on him wouldn&#039;t have sat well with post-war morality. Good thing for the victors then, that Hitler turned out to be an ideological warmonger after all, and Stalin the cold opportunist, rather than the other way round.","filename":"1477524867051","ext":".jpg","w":1530,"h":1127,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":92,"tim":1491680360761,"time":1491680360,"md5":"Ra7DVgfN1rcbyig2IIPE1A==","fsize":479960,"resto":120170207,"id":"bglzQHbQ","country":"IE","m_img":1,"country_name":"Ireland"},{"no":120172609,"now":"04\/08\/17(Sat)15:40:54","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120172393\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120172393<\/a><br>His buddies were crazy too.","filename":"1485199186562","ext":".jpg","w":640,"h":622,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":121,"tim":1491680454200,"time":1491680454,"md5":"DIzj6PpYbReBNwotSRhiSA==","fsize":63295,"resto":120170207,"id":"bglzQHbQ","country":"IE","country_name":"Ireland"},{"no":120172955,"now":"04\/08\/17(Sat)15:43:43","name":"Anonymous","com":"<span class=\"quote\">&gt;man of peace<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;annexes countries left and right<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;invades poland knowing it would provoke war<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;invades soviet union and eastern europe with the sole intention of annihilating slavs and replacing the population with aryans <\/span><br><br>ah yes, a real peaceful guy","time":1491680623,"resto":120170207,"id":"RW\/UnlS8","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"}]},{"posts":[{"no":120172121,"now":"04\/08\/17(Sat)15:37:02","name":"Anonymous","sub":"Styx is a retard","filename":"1491479270759","ext":".jpg","w":1200,"h":827,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":172,"tim":1491680222567,"time":1491680222,"md5":"13IUW5X1G4kRCJnI0dECZw==","fsize":128754,"resto":0,"id":"kO\/MKQfl","country":"TR","m_img":1,"bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"styx-is-a-retard","country_name":"Turkey","replies":11,"images":4,"omitted_posts":6,"omitted_images":4},{"no":120172734,"now":"04\/08\/17(Sat)15:41:58","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120172121\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120172121<\/a>","filename":"1490913468279","ext":".jpg","w":600,"h":580,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":120,"tim":1491680518597,"time":1491680518,"md5":"mtaJvZrOE6\/Qu19FwnZE0Q==","fsize":72420,"resto":120172121,"id":"GAxoepgr","country":"CL","country_name":"Chile"},{"no":120172823,"now":"04\/08\/17(Sat)15:42:43","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120172121\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120172121<\/a><br>Please delete this.

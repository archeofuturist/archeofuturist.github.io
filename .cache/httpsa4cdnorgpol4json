They have the same parasitic communist inclination and lack of national loyalty as Jews. They just lack the foresight and intellectual capacity to be as dangerous on a large scale. The only way we could get rid of them would be to only give them gibs if they went back to Africa. And they would expect free shit forever and for their children and their children.

Basically, I discovered conservatism and right-wing not so long ago, having grown up as a moderate liberal. I have changed a lot of my viewpoints now, but theres one problem: I just don&#039;t believe in god. My family wasn&#039;t very religious, and neither am I.<br>I&#039;d become religious it if only to become less liberal. I understand that Christianity is a pillar that holds the West together, I agree with its morals, and I don&#039;t really have problems with other people&#039;s beliefs. <br>But speaking for myself, I simply never believed, and frankly don&#039;t want to. I would feel like a total faker, a hypocrite and a black sheep among people going to a church or wearing a cross. Not to mention, I don&#039;t really have much faith in orthodox church, which is still recovering from having been banned from people for 70 years and is limited to Russia and a few other slav countries only. A lot of people think of religious people as nuts, too, especially young people.<br>So what should I do, really? It feels like a no win situation.","filename":"130706miles","ext":".jpg","w":328,"h":284,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":216,"tim":1493858845529,"time":1493858845,"md5":"9j5OG4vQuFVlZemFWYeDbg==","fsize":89230,"resto":0,"id":"FegpurvG","country":"RU","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"hey-pol-i-want-to-ask-you-for-advice-basically-i","country_name":"Russian Federation","replies":42,"images":6,"omitted_posts":37,"omitted_images":5},{"no":124002334,"now":"05\/03\/17(Wed)22:09:04","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p124002197\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;124002197<\/a><br><br>tl;dr:<br><br>Void and Matter are interrelated constructs.","time":1493863744,"resto":123992715,"id":"du\/FLgck","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":124002387,"now":"05\/03\/17(Wed)22:09:25","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123992715\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123992715<\/a><br>I don&#039;t have faith in the strictest sense but I still joined a church and became a christian.

Media reports stated that after Choi Tae-Min\u2019s death in 1994, his daughter Choi Soon-sil became a close advisor for Park and that during this time there were rumors (firmly denied by the president) of shamanist rituals being performed in the Blue House. Korean news outlet The Hankyoreh revealed that Soon-sil exercised extreme levels of control over Park, to the extent that she was dictating the president\u2019s own policy.&quot;","filename":"Screen Shot 2017-05-03 at 7.58.13 PM","ext":".png","w":527,"h":351,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":166,"tim":1493860120524,"time":1493860120,"md5":"CI\/1W1YxW7wpihm\/SPm\/1Q==","fsize":232100,"resto":0,"id":"OBklzmsm","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"south-korean-8-goddess-scandal-sk-pres-accused-of","country_name":"United States","replies":31,"images":20,"omitted_posts":26,"omitted_images":16},{"no":124002394,"now":"05\/03\/17(Wed)22:09:30","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123995105\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123995105<\/a><br><a href=\"#p124000499\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;124000499<\/a><br><br><a href=\"\/pol\/thread\/124001936#p124001936\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;124001936<\/a>","time":1493863770,"resto":123995105,"id":"HldPrDiL","country":"PL","country_name":"Poland"},{"no":124002527,"now":"05\/03\/17(Wed)22:10:32","name":"Anonymous","com":"Rituals in the national assembly... totally normal I&#039;m sure.

The ceremony was attended by over 200 people, including politicians, supermodels, doctors and shamanists.

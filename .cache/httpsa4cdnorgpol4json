Well no French fries for me I guess , I can&#039;t even eat at a fucking Bueno Taco! Can&#039;t live my life anymore , so I&#039;m here to say I quit. I wanted to relinquish to yourselves my flag and my art , but before l do here is a story and my heart .<br><br>I saw an automobile in Lapland once when I was younger in acting , Now they&#039;re everywhere. The world went and got itself in a big damn hurry. I say to myself lots that I wouldn&#039;t give in but I here, take a piece of my soul .<br><br>You might not know this cause of the gag order but I am being sued by all the people I assaulted, all the &quot;nazis&quot; and I am sorry , doesn&#039;t change how I acted or the amount of money it&#039;s costing me.<br>The parole board got me into this halfway house and a job bagging groceries at the Foodway. It&#039;s hard work. I try to keep up, but my hands hurt most of the time. I don&#039;t think the store manager likes me very much. Since my last movie bombed I&#039;m just trying my best.<br><br>Sometimes after work I go to the park and feed the birds. I keep thinking Jaiden might show up and say hello, but he never does. I hope wherever he is, he&#039;s doing okay and making new friends. <br><br>I have trouble sleeping at night. I wake up scared. Sometimes it takes me a while to remember where I am. <br><br><br>Maybe I should get me a gun and rob the Foodway, so they&#039;d send me home. I could shoot the manager while I was at it, sort of like a bonus. But I guess I&#039;m too old for that sort of nonsense anymore. I don&#039;t like it here. I&#039;m tired of being afraid all the time. I&#039;ve decided not to stay. <br><br><br>I doubt they&#039;ll kick up any fuss. <br><br>You have defeated my guys , I will fade into obscurity <br>Not for an old crook like me.","filename":"IMG_1085","ext":".jpg","w":620,"h":412,"tn_w":249,"tn_h":166,"tim":1493172089942,"time":1493172089,"md5":"GedFxCyfZSzh00NTirTm\/g==","fsize":195038,"resto":0,"id":"GhFIrjxp","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"sick-of-being-raided-by-pol","country_name":"United States","replies":41,"images":7,"omitted_posts":36,"omitted_images":7},{"no":122832341,"now":"04\/25\/17(Tue)22:56:33","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122825558\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122825558<\/a><br>Shit I haven&#039;t watched the Shawshank Redemption since I was redpilled.

Marxist socialism wanted to nationalize all private industry, while NatSoc privatized every major industry except the railroads (it considered these a military asset. In fact, Hitler once joked &quot;they didn&#039;t need to nationalize property because they nationalized people&quot;. NatSoc drew on a range of pan-German theories, which wanted to blend Aryan workers and Aryan magnates into a super Aryan state, which would involve the eradication of class-focused socialism as a non-German ideology.","time":1491465155,"resto":119717976,"id":"xOsnrvWl","country":"CA","country_name":"Canada"},{"no":119719739,"now":"04\/06\/17(Thu)03:58:08","name":"Anonymous","com":"Romanian Nationalists&#039; anthem<br><br>https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=SXV<wbr>YBoxuMIo","filename":"681331d38665b9b495546fdd9806d83e39a87039b930d1b551edb26764037f53","ext":".jpg","w":1500,"h":1124,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":93,"tim":1491465488490,"time":1491465488,"md5":"vOm\/7HhTJq0T1D+Eey54WQ==","fsize":159680,"resto":119717976,"id":"xOsnrvWl","country":"CA","m_img":1,"country_name":"Canada"},{"no":119720070,"now":"04\/06\/17(Thu)04:04:24","name":"Anonymous","com":"Norwegian SS song<br><br>https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=yka<wbr>Qb9gEgcU","filename":"1486237178915","ext":".jpg","w":286,"h":400,"tn_w":89,"tn_h":125,"tim":1491465864241,"time":1491465864,"md5":"845vmiCb+4uqgFTnhsoQ0Q==","fsize":25835,"resto":119717976,"id":"xOsnrvWl","country":"CA","country_name":"Canada"},{"no":119720501,"now":"04\/06\/17(Thu)04:11:54","name":"Anonymous","com":"America would have to be one of the saddest cases in history, wouldn&#039;t it?

Imagine an America where the transatlantic slave trade never happened and instead of being open to immigrants, they adopted a &quot;White America&quot; policy like we did. No Jews would be able to take control either, then. Its potential for greatness and glory would be awe-inspiring. I believe had history gone this way, America would have become truly the greatest nation in human existence.

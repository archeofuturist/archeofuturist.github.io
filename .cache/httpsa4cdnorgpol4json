If you were witness to how difficult it is to come to Canada legally, you have respect for those who are lawful and follow the rules. For some reason, the children of 1st generation immigrants (ie. parents came to Canada from France, and made Sally Sue in Canada) think we should welcome everyone with open arms.

For example from what I&#039;ve seen Damascus is an absolute shit show (there could be lots of parts that are still ok but I haven&#039;t done too much looking into it), I agree that those people should have somewhere safe to go but I also think that there should be an effort to return and build so there has to be a bit of both worlds. I do hate the fact that none of the neighboring countries are taking in their people, again I&#039;m not too sure about compatibility if some were christians, shia, sunni whatever then obviously they wouldn&#039;t think about it. But like you said <a href=\"#p119242251\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119242251<\/a> when they hear about Germany coddling them giving them houses and yearly allowances for all their children they will see $$ in their eyes but you can&#039;t blame a human for taking the path of least resistance so it&#039;s a problem with the system. As for the refugee problem in Canada where they are crossing into Alberta\/Winnipeg getting frost-bite, it&#039;s pretty irresponsible because they are putting their children at risk I&#039;ve heard they cross through blizzards and stuff. Another reason it&#039;s irresponsible is because they are automatically burdening themselves onto the backs of ordinary small town folk who don&#039;t have the resources to properly help them.","time":1491165754,"resto":119238979,"id":"Tp0cwH7M","country":"CA","country_name":"Canada"},{"no":119243500,"now":"04\/02\/17(Sun)16:43:28","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119238979\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119238979<\/a><br>Is it really feasible to move 7 million people from Syria?

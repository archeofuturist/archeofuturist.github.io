He had a particular enthusiasm for birds and most of all for wolves. [...] Goebbels said, famously, \u2018The only real friend one has in the end is the dog. . . The more I get to know the human species, the more I care for my Benno.\u2019 Goebbels also agreed with Hitler that \u2018meat eating is a perversion in our human nature,\u2019 and that Christianity was a \u2018symptom of decay\u2019, since it did not urge vegetarianism. According to these transcripts dated 11 November 1941, Hitler said, &quot;One may regret living at a period when it&#039;s impossible to form an idea of the shape the world of the future will assume. But there&#039;s one thing I can predict to eaters of meat: the world of the future will be vegetarian.&quot; On 12 January 1942, he said, &quot;The only thing of which I shall be incapable is to share the sheiks&#039; mutton with them. I&#039;m a vegetarian, and they must spare me from their meat.&quot;[5] In a diary entry dated 26 April 1942, Joseph Goebbels described Hitler as a committed vegetarian, writing,<br><br>An extended chapter of our talk was devoted by the F\u00fchrer to the vegetarian question. He believes more than ever that meat-eating is harmful to humanity. Of course he knows that during the war we cannot completely upset our food system. After the war, however, he intends to tackle this problem also. Maybe he is right. Certainly the arguments that he adduces in favor of his standpoint are very compelling.[6]<br><br>In his table talks, on 25 April 1942 at midday, Hitler addressed the issue of vegetarianism and spoke about Roman soldiers eating fruits and cereals and the importance of raw vegetables. He placed the emphasis on scientific arguments such as naturalists&#039; observations and chemical efficacy.&quot; <br>Why haven&#039;t you taken the vegetarian\/vegan pill?","filename":"9","ext":".jpg","w":480,"h":447,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":232,"tim":1491686234383,"time":1491686234,"md5":"wkz+DOMI9Wm9XM71NBx8LA==","fsize":22062,"resto":0,"id":"2nc6YhRb","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"hitler-a-vegetarian-and-hater-of-hunting-adored","country_name":"United States","replies":5,"images":1},{"no":120184404,"now":"04\/08\/17(Sat)17:20:17","name":"Anonymous","com":"bump for Hitler","time":1491686417,"resto":120184059,"id":"2nc6YhRb","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":120184766,"now":"04\/08\/17(Sat)17:23:26","name":"Anonymous","com":"bump for superior health","time":1491686606,"resto":120184059,"id":"2nc6YhRb","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":120185049,"now":"04\/08\/17(Sat)17:26:03","name":"Anonymous","com":"<span class=\"quote\">&gt;iFaggot watermark<\/span><br><br>GET THE FUCK OUT YOU MOBILEFAGGOT","filename":"ifunny watermark","ext":".jpg","w":500,"h":459,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":114,"tim":1491686763063,"time":1491686763,"md5":"fA+2T\/iBkeyfyTLFGa4rsQ==","fsize":45228,"resto":120184059,"id":"W3ZA2YoK","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":120185802,"now":"04\/08\/17(Sat)17:32:15","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120184059\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120184059<\/a><br>being vegan is the best choice, especially for Aryans and anyone with high standards","time":1491687135,"resto":120184059,"id":"XIY0dsie","country":"DE","country_name":"Germany"},{"no":120187357,"now":"04\/08\/17(Sat)17:44:03","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120184059\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120184059<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;*starts a war that gets 60 million people killed and directly kill 11 million civilians*<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;ugh why are humans so bad, I prefer my dog hes nice<\/span><br><br>ebin","time":1491687843,"resto":120184059,"id":"fOJ0QmEl","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"}]},{"posts":[{"no":120182819,"now":"04\/08\/17(Sat)17:06:43","name":"Anonymous","com":"Daily reminder that the recent influx of anti- trump posts is all paid shills.","filename":"IMG_2608","ext":".jpg","w":1281,"h":562,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":109,"tim":1491685603713,"time":1491685603,"md5":"vuW5t\/BzXLaRKXFVWQt\/Fg==","fsize":232949,"resto":0,"id":"Ub7\/vIR6","country":"US","m_img":1,"bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"daily-reminder-that-the-recent-influx-of-anti","country_name":"United States","replies":27,"images":9,"omitted_posts":22,"omitted_images":8},{"no":120186759,"now":"04\/08\/17(Sat)17:39:30","name":"Anonymous","com":"<span class=\"quote\">&gt;guys it doesn&#039;t matter if Trump sold out and is pushing the establishments agenda<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;If anyone criticisizes him they&#039;re paid shills<\/span><br>You&#039;ll see when we&#039;re still here in a month faggot.

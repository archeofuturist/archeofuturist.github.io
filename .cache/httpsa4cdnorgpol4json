Crul has been investigating migration and integration for 25 years and has just begun a major new study this year, not of migrant groups but of the \u2018white ethnic Dutch\u2019 \u2018It\u2019s already happening in Amsterdam. Only one in three youngsters under the age of 15 is of Dutch parentage,\u2019 Crul told Trouw. With a team of eight researchers, Crul is starting a unique \u20ac2.5m 5-year study of six large European cities, including Amsterdam and Rotterdam. Frankfurt, Antwerp, Malm\u00f6 and Vienna will also come under the spotlight. If you want to look at integration, you need to look at the ethnic white Dutch, he said. \u2018Who adapts to who if there is no majority?,\u2019 he said. \u2018The ethnic Dutch are the most unstable factor in Amsterdam. They move in while they are at university, and then leave or move with their young families to the suburbs.

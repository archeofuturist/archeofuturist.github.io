Jesus was also a rebel against the Jews and he was killed with the Jewish approval which basically means they could have saved him, but didn&#039;t so their blood is also on their hands. The Romans at first didn&#039;t even want to kill Jesus, but the Jews almost begged him.<br><br>So you have Jews who represent materialism (the devil also represents the material world and Jesus even said he was the father of the Jews). But all people only have 1 father and that is god, our spiritual father. So the struggle against Judaism represents the struggle of the fake material world versus the real spiritual world. The inferior races also represent the material world, because they lack spirit and are thus unable to create and maintain culture. They are fake humans, not real humans, driven solely by instincts. Just look at how materialistic and barbaric niggers and chinks are. A chink would not even save a dying person on the street. Do real humans behave like that?

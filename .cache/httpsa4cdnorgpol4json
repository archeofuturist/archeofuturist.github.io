Pattern recognition destroys liberal propaganda and it&#039;s ability to brainwash.

When it&#039;s a minority...crickets chirping (this tactic is becoming increasingly hilarious in Europe with the massive spike in Muslim crime - they either ignore the story entirely, or do everything in their power not to divulge the perp&#039;s race).<br><br>B) Everyone gets to have the First Amendment right to freedom of association (AIPAC for Jews, NAACP for blacks, HRC for fags, etc), except whites. If a European American Association ever emerged, the Jews would go cross-eyed and shit themselves.<br><br>C) The (((left&#039;s))) need to ally with the &quot;other&quot; against whites, regardless of how absurd the alliance is.

Do you really think that &quot;shooting guns, drinking good ol&#039; beer&quot; and saying &quot;Naw fuck those immigrants taking all &#039;ere jobs!&quot; is better than the benefits of the city?<br><br>FACT: Nations became great due to modernisation. Modernisation occurred because of urbanisation. Cities can plan, organise and execute FAR FAR better than a bunch of hillbillies.

New Urbanists and the Strong Town movement are pretty receptive to conservative ideas like deregulation of land use and fiscal conservatism. Conservative urban policy is something that should be explored more. <br><br>Conservative urban politics runs up against three big problems. The first is that government services are much more important in urban areas than in rural areas. If the mass transit system or garbage trucks shut down one day in a big city, then everything would go to hell. Second is that cities attract three very liberal demographics: blacks, homosexuals, and young singles. Third, people who live in cities put more importance on public amenities than private amenities (e.g. a park vs a lawn) and those people tend to be more liberal.","time":1493780222,"resto":123852415,"id":"dNmEbNtC","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":123861398,"now":"05\/02\/17(Tue)22:57:08","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123852415\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123852415<\/a><br>Don&#039;t put your weight on my body","filename":"1485469021663","ext":".jpg","w":700,"h":907,"tn_w":96,"tn_h":125,"tim":1493780228849,"time":1493780228,"md5":"L\/h1oxeDGWX\/ldxPkYTBxw==","fsize":144855,"resto":123852415,"id":"srrjN7o5","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":123861406,"now":"05\/02\/17(Tue)22:57:14","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123860762\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123860762<\/a><br>if we are going to have blacks around, rather than genocide, they should be forced out of cities.

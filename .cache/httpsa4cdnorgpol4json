You can&#039;t just ignore it nor simply shout things like &quot;fallacy fallacy!&quot; when someone calls you out on a fallacy.

That means your conclusion does not follow from your premises. &quot;b-but you haven&#039;t proved me wrong,&quot; isn&#039;t a valid argument either and is only an attempt to shift burden of proof. A fallacy fallacy is also only committed when it&#039;s concluded that the conclusion of an argument is false just because the argument is invalid, which is fallacious. Obviously, the conclusion can still be right by accident. One does not commit a fallacy fallacy simply by citing how your argument is fallacious.

Every race has its own genetic issues, look up any ethnicity plus &quot;genetic diseases&quot; and you&#039;ll be amazed at how much can go wrong in the human body.<br>Are you dumb enough to fall for the propaganda of a mentally ill man who believed every other race to be the sources of the problems in his country? Are you dumb enough to think that he wasn&#039;t just manipulating the masses into having rabid nationalism so they would follow his will?<br>I don&#039;t think you&#039;re that dumb. You should think carefully about what you believe and what the sources of your information are really trying to accomplish.","time":1492075229,"resto":120884744,"id":"n61dHgpO","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":120890476,"now":"04\/13\/17(Thu)05:22:21","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120890332\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120890332<\/a><br>I am mixed and that only bothered me as a child.

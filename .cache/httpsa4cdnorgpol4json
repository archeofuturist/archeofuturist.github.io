You could argue to sterilize them after they had 1 or 2 children though. And that would be a compelling and legitimate argument also. <br><br>I don&#039;t hate any child it&#039;s the parents and their irresponsible actions that is the issue, the child doesn&#039;t really have a choice with being born but it&#039;s the parents that are supposed to take care of them and knowing that they can do this before they decide to have a child. This whole kicking the can down the road shit and then blaming responsible people and asking them to somehow give them what they need now that they&#039;re there.. that shit has got to go.","time":1490429717,"resto":118197672,"id":"Ssn7SNMS","country":"DK","country_name":"Denmark"},{"no":118203449,"now":"03\/25\/17(Sat)04:19:56","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118203153\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118203153<\/a><br>Cuck","time":1490429996,"resto":118197672,"id":"ZJ5tcY0D","country":"AU","country_name":"Australia"},{"no":118203603,"now":"03\/25\/17(Sat)04:22:24","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118203449\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118203449<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;sort out your own nations, don&#039;t wreck them due to your lack of responsibility and lack of effort, and then pretend that you can be allowed to come here and destroy our way of doing things that work.<\/span><br>That&#039;s a bit the opposite of a cuck isn&#039;t it?","time":1490430144,"resto":118197672,"id":"Ssn7SNMS","country":"DK","country_name":"Denmark"},{"no":118203937,"now":"03\/25\/17(Sat)04:27:25","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118203153\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118203153<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;It was always edgy you faggot, the fact is that mathematically if they had 1 or 2 kids instead of 10 whilst gradually improving their infrastructure their populations would stabilize over 50 years or so, getting 3rd world nations atleast reasonably close to 2nd world level.<\/span><br>weeeeew<br>How about you lurk more you Danish fucking cuck.<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;muh welfare wrecked Africa<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;muh democrats are the real racists<\/span>","time":1490430445,"resto":118197672,"id":"ipILM9WV","country":"US","country_name":"United States"}]},{"posts":[{"no":118186557,"now":"03\/25\/17(Sat)00:41:56","name":"Anonymous","com":"Why haven&#039;t you found a red pilled gf\/wife yet?","filename":"14864193459510","ext":".jpg","w":1080,"h":720,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":166,"tim":1490416916550,"time":1490416916,"md5":"vOfvfAdz2JQ1JilgJUR4Jw==","fsize":105952,"resto":0,"id":"jFE6oLr0","country":"KR","m_img":1,"bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"why-havent-you-found-a-red-pilled-gfwife-yet","country_name":"South Korea","replies":140,"images":55,"omitted_posts":135,"omitted_images":54,"tail_size":50},{"no":118203622,"now":"03\/25\/17(Sat)04:22:44","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118197038\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118197038<\/a><br>Nigger detected.

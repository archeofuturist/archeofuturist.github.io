It&#039;s basically ran like a Japanese school; kids and faculty help maintain shit instead of hiring mexican janitors, kids stay in one classroom instead of running around like cattle save for maintenance, PE, and trade courses. That last bit is why these schools will succeed. When they first arrive, they&#039;ll have an option to choose a trade: Electrical, Plumbing, Coding\/IT, etc, so that way once they graduate, they&#039;ll be certified and ready to work for the city\/state\/military\/PMC companies instead of giving thousands of dollars to worthless colleges. <br><br>Of course it will be a private school but an affordable one, $500 a month, which any parent who really wants their kid to succeed can go and make $125 doing uber 4 saturdays\/sundays out of the month for 6 hours to pay for tuition if they really want them to go that badly.

It makes sense to do it here because there&#039;s so many harry potter and weeabo anime parents who would cream their pants at a chance to live through their kids by sending them here. HOWEVER, since it is a private school, that means I can run it how I please, which means I&#039;m sure as shit not gonna give two iota&#039;s of a fuck about trasnsanimalgenderism or diversity. Boys go to the boys locker room, girls go to the girls locker room, and if they don&#039;t like it, they can fuck off back to public school with the rest of the dregs, and there won&#039;t be any kind of diversity quotas either.<br><br>Continued<br>VVVVVVVV","filename":"japanese high school","ext":".png","w":500,"h":282,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":141,"tim":1492908631923,"time":1492908631,"md5":"EnLRRKhKBq8\/26Fmc2jljw==","fsize":219998,"resto":0,"id":"9hIzIkdB","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"opening-a-series-of-schools-to-piss-off-commies","country_name":"United States","replies":15,"images":0,"omitted_posts":10,"omitted_images":0},{"no":122357526,"now":"04\/22\/17(Sat)21:16:20","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122357326\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122357326<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;One question though: Would you enroll more whites than POC?<\/span><br><br>This idea hatched out of spite because of an article I read about LAUSD cutting funding from a school because they had too many white students.

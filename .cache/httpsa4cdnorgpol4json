Once it happens, while all incarnated souls will most definitely notice (There will be a moment of existence in zero-point time, and oneness with The All), nothing too insane will happen physically. No growing wings and floating up into the clouds or anything. Weather\/natural disasters are possible though. Everything that happens would mostly occur not on the physical plane, but rather on the astral plane+place with out higher selves.<br><br>Kek isn&#039;t Ra, sorry to disappoint. However, what you&#039;re saying about having enough people direct their thoughts to Ra, Kek, or any entity, is true. Thoughts are extremely powerful, and if enough beings all dedicate their thoughts and energy to a particular thing, it CAN end up affecting reality - possibly even manifesting as a thought form, and I would personally say Kek already has in some sense. The reason Ra wont intervene with the souls on earth without having a sufficient amount of souls truly wanting it, is of course due to free will. Ra is a STO being, and just randomly getting involved would infringe on free will and his STO polarized self - bad for the entities karma, basically. <br><br>The number you&#039;re looking for is 144,000 souls dedicating their thoughts\/energy to something, it doesn&#039;t just apply to summoning other entities either - there are positive groups right now attempting to get 144,000 people meditating at once, in order to speed up the time of the harvest. The only thing slowing down the event\/harvest is the quarantine this planet is under in the astral and plasma planes.<br><br>I wonder how much of this makes sense, or whether its just gibberish to whoever reads it.

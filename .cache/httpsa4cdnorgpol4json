There is a reason why mudslims and niggers from africa did not immigrated in mass before west countries had gimethats. They came, had to learn the language and the culture and assimilate to get a job and support their family. Most did not stay and just went back. Now since that raising a child is so expensive and it&#039;s almost impossible for single parent we have gimethats for families. But the problem is that those leech are moving here for those very benefits, remember that they did not before because most did not want to assimilate to our culture. What happen is that, canadian families are left with almost no support when those shitskin that need translator get full welfare, housing, social support. A canadian single mom will be told to go live with her parent or seek support from the father when they provide housing and support to those shitskin.

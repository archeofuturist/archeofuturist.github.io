It&#039;s possible that we can ride out the decline, let our nation bottom out in terms of degenerate values, and then rebuild ourselves up over time, while not succumbing to invasion or anarchy due to our technology. (why revolt when you have an iphone? when any food is available? no one wants to risk our comfortable lives no right wing militais, not antifa commies). If we can ride out the degeneration while the powerful hold it together, there is the possibility that we rise from this a stronger people, and this will become one of our most prized stories and myths.

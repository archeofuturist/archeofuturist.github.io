What difference does it make at this point ? We are acting as if we had to earn the trust of these insane and dishonest people. I don&#039;t care of being called racist, and YOU shouldn&#039;t either. Let&#039;s stop wasting political capital waging battles of rhetoric in order to determine who is the less &#039;racist&#039;. This didn&#039;t helped our cause. We should never need to justify our feelings, we don&#039;t need to prove we like niggers and arabs. Just state the facts and let the data speak for itself. Those who ignore the facts will keep on calling you a racist.

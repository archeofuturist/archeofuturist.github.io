Lack of food variation limits intelligence. A) because of the different ways of finding that food limits the variation to come up with mew ideas. B) not enough variation chemically. Even though there is only some link to food chemistry and brain development there is huge variation in food variation and the well being of the whole body and that has links to brain development and well being.<br>3. If you dont have a developed society and economy you wont afford expensive drugs industries. You have to be able to not only make drugs with the resources in your own land but buy resources from other lands and rights to drugs.<br><br>Dont forget we only had penicillin during ww2 for the first time in industrial volumes. That means despite our high IQ we have only been in the medicine age around 70 years. Understanding about germs for a couple of hundred years.

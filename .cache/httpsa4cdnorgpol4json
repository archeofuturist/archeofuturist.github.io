They hate that we Reddit-browsing, 4chan hating, NPR-listening coastal liberal &quot;elites&quot; are the winners in a service-based globalized multicultural society because of our higher brain capacity and education, and they blame all their failures on minorities and undocumented immigrants. They are seeing how America is increasingly becoming vibrantly diverse, and how non-white people will soon be the majority and losing their privilege terrifies them. They see Trump as the savior that will somehow make America go back to how it was in the 1960s, when in reality there is no going back because the values of the progressivism, social justice, feminism, diversity and tolerance are the right side of history.<br><br>Liberals are more flexible and reliant on data, proof, and analytic reasoning, and conservatives are more inflexible (prefer stability), emotion-driven, and connect themselves intimately with their ideas, making those beliefs a crucial part of their identity (we see this in more high-empathy-expressing individuals). This fits in with the whole \u201cfamily values\u201d platform of the conservative party, and also why we see more religious folks that identify as conservatives, and more skeptics, agnostics, and atheists that are liberal.<br>Conservatives would be less likely to assign value primarily using the scientific method. Remember, their thinking style leads primarily with emotion.<br><br>The science confirms it: Liberals are smarter, more empathetic and intellectually better equipped to make the correct voting decision, that&#039;s why we hate Trump. And that&#039;s why reality has a liberal bias.","filename":"drumpf","ext":".png","w":803,"h":428,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":133,"tim":1492364883138,"time":1492364883,"md5":"DsYshjbChWJQGV22nixdew==","fsize":272237,"resto":0,"id":"ExhbQz9M","country":"GB","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"this-is-why-trump-won","country_name":"United Kingdom","replies":140,"images":39,"omitted_posts":135,"omitted_images":37,"tail_size":50},{"no":121409771,"now":"04\/16\/17(Sun)16:35:38","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121388029\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121388029<\/a><br>Could some anon do me a favor and link me to whatever thread this bait is sliding","filename":"react12","ext":".jpg","w":320,"h":320,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":125,"tim":1492374938732,"time":1492374938,"md5":"trAZO3RQSFV\/Q23cvs49Xw==","fsize":15745,"resto":121388029,"id":"W1WcpMu4","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":121410255,"now":"04\/16\/17(Sun)16:39:04","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121389965\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121389965<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;scientists, people who&#039;s job is to be as objective and fact based as possible, are overwhelmingly liberal<\/span><br>get rekt","filename":"1456221227553","ext":".jpg","w":914,"h":700,"tn_w":124,"tn_h":95,"tim":1492375144247,"time":1492375144,"md5":"S3BnzG6seHucVbkSY8DwhA==","fsize":260965,"resto":121388029,"id":"ZBQiteVu","country":"EE","country_name":"Estonia"},{"no":121410585,"now":"04\/16\/17(Sun)16:41:23","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121388029\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121388029<\/a><br>Nice bait.

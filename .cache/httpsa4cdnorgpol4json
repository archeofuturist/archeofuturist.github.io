It changes nothing.","filename":"1492279310128","ext":".jpg","w":864,"h":1026,"tn_w":105,"tn_h":125,"tim":1492493263781,"time":1492493263,"md5":"SlH993Y9XGD1l\/KWH+5HTQ==","fsize":256459,"resto":121642003,"id":"7aSWlZAw","country":"PL","m_img":1,"country_name":"Poland"}]},{"posts":[{"no":121639536,"now":"04\/18\/17(Tue)00:44:14","name":"Anonymous","com":"Reminder that \/pol\/ isn&#039;t alt-right.<br>Stormcucks should go back to Stormfront.","filename":"1488413766027","ext":".png","w":684,"h":588,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":214,"tim":1492490654020,"time":1492490654,"md5":"HDlEx9bQ6DEsWp7lLlLL2w==","fsize":497655,"resto":0,"id":"+kCIpwaX","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"reminder-that-pol-isnt-altright","country_name":"United States","replies":39,"images":14,"omitted_posts":34,"omitted_images":13},{"no":121643286,"now":"04\/18\/17(Tue)01:20:05","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121643064\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121643064<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;OP is a literal Jew in a fucking office in Israel <\/span><br>\/pol\/!

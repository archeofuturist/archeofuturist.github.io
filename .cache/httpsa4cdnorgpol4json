They have shelved healthcare for now. It&#039;s likely they will come back to it, but it will be a disaster for America no matter what as the Republicans work for health insurance companies. The original proposed plan would have doubled the uninsured rate, increased premiums, give 600 billion dollars in tax breaks to the richest 2 percent of Americans, and allow insurance companies to price gouge those who don&#039;t have insurance for over three months. The proposed plan was obviously designed to be a tax break for the rich, not to make healthcare better.<br><br>3. Remember the republicans work for internet service providers and no democrats voted for this at all. There is no denying Obama was horrible on issues of internet privacy, but even he knew these rules were a good idea. Trump has made it his vendetta to remove as many government regulations as possible so it&#039;s likely he will sign this into law. Time will tell...<br><br>4. I don&#039;t ever see Trump resigning; his ego is too large, but with some of the investigations happening he very well could be impeached. His former security adviser said he would testify if granted immunity today, and he stated himself the only time you ask for immunity is if a crime has been committed.<br><br>5.

Always do it with a friend, it&#039;s essential that you don&#039;t try and lift very heavy things by yourself and always be very careful to not hurt your back.<br>Walk fast, use a hill if available, carry a heavy backpack when you walk.<br>Sprint for endurance, if you want you can also get one of those stationary cycles and put the pedals at high resistance.<br><br>Find out what foods increase your testosterone, don&#039;t drink water out of a plastic bottle, get a glass\/metal container instead.<br><br>For breakfast I recommend whole grain bread, mash up bananas, put in hazelnuts and raisins and eat that on top of the bread, maybe have some boiled eggs.<br><br>For meat go with fish or minced beef meat supplement the meat with onions like Norwegian meatcakes. Don&#039;t be scared of garlic.<br>Lots of potatoes.<br>Use olive oil for your cooking.<br>Don&#039;t be afraid of adding lots of greenery and vegetables.<br><br>Don&#039;t be afraid of eating several times a day, the more you can gobble the better really, a olympic class weight lifter I was in the military with ate pretty much everything he got his hands on, having some extra fat helps build muscles, you will see bodybuilders in their &quot;off season&quot; actually be quite fat.","filename":"1491831079710","ext":".jpg","w":621,"h":625,"tn_w":124,"tn_h":125,"tim":1491863313028,"time":1491863313,"md5":"szNatDGcmYnebl+AIJJtXg==","fsize":87608,"resto":120472303,"id":"nMPXH\/PU","country":"NO","country_name":"Norway"},{"no":120502793,"now":"04\/10\/17(Mon)18:29:00","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120500780\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120500780<\/a><br><a href=\"#p120501228\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120501228<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;you&#039;d look aryan as fuck<\/span><br>Yeah, a lot good that did Germany and Sweden right?<br><br>You sound like such a faggot.

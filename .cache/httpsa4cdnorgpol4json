With the idea of protests, they see it as promoting divide, pushing social cultural norms (they have every right to do this, as we live in a Capitalist society, the consequences and reception is their own) and, to extremely far right, it has a lot of brown and Muslim people.<br>To the left, who are highly against corporatism, this is an insult. It trivializes the protests curently happening or have happened as they are serious political events and only in the effort to promote a product. It also trivializes the concern of Police Abuse by simply saying, &quot;If you give a cop a Pepsi, they won&#039;t harass you.&quot; This one is an insult to both the left and right. To the left, the police are aggressive enough at protests in their opinion, and to the right it insults the honour to the badge as to say an officer would simply move along because he got some Pepsi.<br>The conclusion is simple.. <br>BUY STOCKS IN COCA COLA NOW, GO BUY 50 CANS.

Now we have a government that thinks so too, unless I&#039;m wrong and all governments think this way (why else would a person proceed into government?) but I am firm only in the belief that there will be no grand designs from this era, rather our democracy will become full fledged and it will be a tyranny of absolute mediocrity. My reasons for believing this are completely anecdotal and not hard facts, but what is a fact is that this nation has abandoned not only God, but the idea of God, and so also the idea of truth, and of the sanctity of the individual. What can follow for us? A roguish young man fears not, but logically, and even without any deducion who dares say that we have a bright future? Only an imbecile who perceives the world from indoors. He perceives his imagination only.

Cities like Limerick are largely impoverished because no one wants to develop a City that hates itself and wont look after itself. The backwards law of the land is, as long as the GAA is happy then &quot;its grand&quot;. Its not grand. We need to start cleaning up the area outside our homes, decrease noise and light pollution, communicate with one another, penalise landlords who refuse to cap rents. Cap rates on small businesses. Say hello to our neighbours and help them. If we want Ireland to change it literally starts with the person living beside you. <br><br>We don&#039;t need anymore pubs, chemists, bookies, river Islands, and beauty salons. And those who think that pumping a town with shit outsourced businesses - should be met with hostility and penalised. <br>Ireland cant float its economy on a few hundred jobs at Apple and Yahoo in Dublin - They must pay their taxes or fuck off and let new business grow.<br><br>Most important is our food and water systems need a complete restructuring. Irish people are experiencing massive depression and anxiety and just take a look at what they are eating and drinking. <br><br>We have incredible land, produce, and fisheries here and we are exporting it all out of the country.<br>We need to support local farming and urban farming start ups.<br>Our Seas, Rivers and Streams are overflowing with fish that the Irish refuse to make apart of their diet.

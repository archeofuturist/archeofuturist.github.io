On Tuesday, Lambda Legal joined the suit, which seeks damages for breach of contract, negligent misrepresentation, and the intentional and negligent infliction of emotional distress. Zawadski and Gaspari aren\u2019t suing the funeral home for engaging in anti-gay discrimination because Mississippi does not protect LGBTQ people from refusal of service. Indeed, the state\u2019s notorious HB 1523 actually protects businesses\u2019 right to turn away LGBTQ customers\u2014though the courts have put that law on hold for now.<br><br>Initially, the nearby Picayune Funeral Home seemed like a perfect choice, and Gaspari paid the company $1,795 to transport and cremate Huskey\u2019s body once he passed. But when Huskey died and the nursing home contacted the funeral home to pick up his body, it refused to do so. The funeral home had discovered that Huskey\u2019s next-of-kin was his husband, and realizing Huskey was gay, informed the nursing home that it did not \u201cdeal with their

Its members endorsed &quot;elective abortion,&quot; believing that every woman seeking an abortion is entitled to proper medical care without harassment; Society for Humane Abortion supported the repeal, rather than the reform, of all abortion laws. The Society sought to educate the public by sponsoring symposia on abortion procedures for physicians; providing speakers and literature to libraries, medical schools, physicians, family planning agencies, and individuals; and publishing a quarterly newsletter. In 1968 and 1968, Society for Humane Abortion maintained a free Post-Abortion Care Center (PACC), which was sponsored by the American Humanist Association. Society for Humane Abortion disbanded in 1975, two years after the Supreme Court voided California&#039;s 1963 &quot;Humane Abortion Act.&quot;<br>In order to safeguard Society for Humane Abortion&#039;s tax-free educational status, Patricia Maginnis set up a parallel organization, the Association to Repeal Abortion Laws (ARAL), in 1966 to carry on underground activities: making referrals to abortion specialists; preparing and disseminating printed material about specialists and about self-induced abortion; and holding classes on abortion-related laws, Mexican abortion specialists, and self-induced abortion techniques. For a small donation, pregnant women received a kit prepared by Association to Repeal Abortion Laws containing annotated lists of abortion specialists in Mexico, Japan, Puerto Rico, and other countries, instructions for going through customs, an evaluation form to be returned to Association to Repeal Abortion Laws after completion of the abortion, summaries of laws, and directions for self-induced abortion. The evaluations were used to update the list, and many specialists were visited by a member of Association to Repeal Abortion Laws before they were listed.","time":1493764636,"resto":123816321,"id":"YDztLdZL","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":123831247,"now":"05\/02\/17(Tue)18:38:05","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123827315\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123827315<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;not a person if not documented<\/span><br><br>I like where this is going.

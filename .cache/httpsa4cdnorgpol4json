I&#039;m at the point where I still eat meat, but realise it is a selfish choice. As it stands right now, there is no rational reason for eating meat. Vegan diets are better for long term health. If the enviroment angle is how you wanna play it, vegan diets are more globally sustainable. Then there is the ethical side as well. I think the only cases where it is warranted to eat meat and it is not selfish is when you&#039;ve either hunted the animal yourself, or if it was raised as livestock on a small scale farm (i.e you raised it or your neighbour raised it etc). Also if you do not have the means to obtain nutritional profile from eating a vegan diet in your area (don&#039;t have access to a large food\/supplement store). Feel free to prove me wrong I am open ears. Also some other things, pls no appeal to nature arguments (I used to think this was the zinger against veganism but muh evoloution is a terrible argument).

The survey found that 20% of millennials identify as openly LGBT, while only 7% of the baby boomer generation (ages 52\u201371) would openly label themselves as such. Acceptance of the LGBT community was also found to be at an all-time high.<br><br>&quot;America is the most accepting that it has ever been. Having 20% of millennials identify as LGBTQ is pretty groundbreaking,&quot; Sarah Kate Ellis, GLAAD&#039;s president and CEO, told BuzzFeed News. &quot;What I want to see is that they continue to flourish and blossom as their true and authentic selves.&quot;<br><br>The survey also found that 12% of millennials identify outside the gender binary, as either transgender or gender-nonconforming.<br><br>But although more young people openly identify as LGBT, the study found that non-LGBT millennials are less likely to know someone who identifies as simply \u201cgay\u201d or \u201clesbian.&quot;<br><br>The study found that an overwhelming 63% of young people identify as allies to the queer community. While that age group was the most likely to be accepting, the majority (53%) of Generation X and the majority (51%) of baby boomers were also likely to consider themselves allies.","filename":"lgbt","ext":".png","w":1600,"h":630,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":98,"tim":1490925232393,"time":1490925232,"md5":"+LHoRw5mnUtuC1FQLB1LBA==","fsize":73492,"resto":0,"id":"1syY9gHD","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"adults-1834-twice-as-likely-as-previous","country_name":"United States","replies":33,"images":9,"omitted_posts":28,"omitted_images":7},{"no":119005672,"now":"03\/30\/17(Thu)22:19:51","name":"Anonymous","com":"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=UQ6<wbr>bH_qoM4Y","time":1490926791,"resto":119002733,"id":"Ewq8v+dm","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":119005867,"now":"03\/30\/17(Thu)22:21:34","name":"Anonymous","com":"Polls like this are stupid, there are 320 millions people in the US.

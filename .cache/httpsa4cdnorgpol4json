From my country it is easy to go there as a tourist using ESTA visa, but I don&#039;t want to go there as an illegal immigrant. Right now I am 21 y.o. working as a C++ developer for embedded devices, I own two flats in Hungary (one of them is rented out on AirBnB, I live in the other one) so I have a pretty decent life. I am telling this so that you will know that I don&#039;t want to go there for welfare, aid etc. I would like to explore many states, cities, try a bunch of things and eventually settle down. My problem is that I don&#039;t see a clear way on how to get there legally.<br>I haven&#039;t finished the university because I got a pretty good job which required only talent rather than the papers. Right now I am planning to go back but there are the following issues:<br>- Any non-american university degree is pretty much worthless if I want to work in the US.<br>- Every university which gives an acceptable degree costs waaay too much for me (of course I&#039;d work along with my studies.)<br><br>The question is:<br>Is there anyone who got a job in the US with a European degree? And if yes, when did you move out and how hard it was?<br><br>Thank you if you&#039;ve read this through &amp; give a reasonable answer.

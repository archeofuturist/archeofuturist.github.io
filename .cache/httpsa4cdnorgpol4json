Unfortunately, I can\u2019t be bothered to dignify it. Why, you may ask? Well, I must inform you that in the span of glancing at your post, I have ejaculated about five times to a rather enthralling hentai called \u2018Emergence\u2019. The way the hentai depicts the gradual process of a virgin becoming a cum dumpster really made me erect. Hell, I haven\u2019t gotten that aroused since Anton Yelchin\u2019s death. Anyways, this girl gets raped by her drunk father and has sex with all the boys at school. Now, these parts were perfectly fappable, but the real fun starts when she gets bullied and ostracised from her class. Her downward spiral of drugs and prostitution eventually leads to her becoming a mere shadow of a human being. In her last dying moments as a pregnant prostitute, she dreams of a future with her (would be) daughter. Instead of getting to live that future, she dies alone in a cold room. I swear that last scene will always bring me to ecstasy. Now, if you really want to get my attention, you must commit yourself to reading such refined works as I do. Only then can I consider you my intellectual equal.","time":1492417865,"resto":121499317,"id":"+WBwQMJJ","country":"CA","country_name":"Canada"},{"no":121501687,"now":"04\/17\/17(Mon)04:31:58","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121500559\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121500559<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;getting old<\/span><br><br>You do realise your whole post is the prime example why it happends in the first place.","time":1492417918,"resto":121499317,"id":"KJ7+tGvh","country":"NL","country_name":"Netherlands"},{"no":121501954,"now":"04\/17\/17(Mon)04:35:19","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121500559\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121500559<\/a><br>you stupid leaf cunt!<br><br>bump","time":1492418119,"resto":121499317,"id":"+5Ozl084","country":"CH","country_name":"Switzerland"},{"no":121502545,"now":"04\/17\/17(Mon)04:43:25","name":"Anonymous","com":"Fucking canucucks","filename":"1470422947165","ext":".png","w":533,"h":800,"tn_w":83,"tn_h":125,"tim":1492418605612,"time":1492418605,"md5":"uMf5qWgjYPN16JS9wBBJDQ==","fsize":510698,"resto":121499317,"id":"PVGhf9g8","country":"ES","country_name":"Spain"}]},{"posts":[{"no":121502062,"now":"04\/17\/17(Mon)04:36:45","name":"Anonymous","com":"Your thought on this video?<br><br>https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=H-C<wbr>qJYzDSI8","filename":"Kuvankaappaus 2017-4-17 kello 11.33.51","ext":".png","w":850,"h":483,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":142,"tim":1492418205659,"time":1492418205,"md5":"sk4\/9\/6++1eEHU1CbijsbA==","fsize":377134,"resto":0,"id":"CJg21RjW","country":"FI","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"your-thought-on-this-video","country_name":"Finland","replies":2,"images":0},{"no":121502397,"now":"04\/17\/17(Mon)04:41:38","name":"Anonymous","com":"GET THIS PUBLIC ATTENTION","time":1492418498,"resto":121502062,"id":"QUYUr0lV","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":121502541,"now":"04\/17\/17(Mon)04:43:23","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121502062\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121502062<\/a><br>Old.

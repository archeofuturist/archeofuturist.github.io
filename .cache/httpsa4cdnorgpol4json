The more agents interacting with each other, the more chance that something unexpected will happen. This emergence can sometimes be beneficial, but it can also be catastrophic. If you look at countries, the ones with large populations are rarely the ones that are the richest, and most free of crime. The one&#039;s at the top are often the one&#039;s with the least population, whereas the larger countries often struggle. I&#039;m convinced this is due, in part, to the complexity problem which I just described. Consider also this: many political ideologies can work within very small communities of 20-100, but are a disaster when implemented at an international level. You can live communally with a group of friends, and their friends, but communism seems to lead to economic collapse and atrocity, when scaled up. So globalism is the biggest possible system we can imagine. It&#039;s at least fair to allow other people to voice skepticism of such an arrangement.

The thing about the left is that at its core the voters are individuals, while for the right its mostly families.<br>You can go around and ask liberals and alot of them will say something like &quot;oh if marriage happens it happens im not looking for it right now&quot; or something as such, while most people on the right are all about starting a family. <br>I do suppose liberals cannot comprehend why thats a bad thing because to them everythings a social construct and sadly, they use that as a derogatory term that helps them dismiss whatever they want to. Culture - yeah its a fucking social construct but that doesnt mean you shouldnt respect it, same with nation.<br>Much smarter people than you, me, or any leftist, have stated throughout history that a nation is a unity not simply of just territory.<br>Why im saying this is because feminism is what pushed the whole individual thing long time ago. And now you have this &quot;i see no boarder, people of the earth&quot; type bullshit, it is idiotic at best.<br>Another reason why even the old feminism is dumb is because now women are in the workforce, this might have not seemed like a bad idea at the start however its much different in reality. <br>Now there are roughly 2 times more people wanting to work, which means that the value of a single person has been reduced 2 times. And women still want the whole &quot;I want a man to work and provide for the family&quot; well guess what fuck yourself, what man can earn has been reduced in half because there are more people wanting to do the same job right now.

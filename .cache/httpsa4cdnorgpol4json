The low huddle of houses was accented by the towers of church, town-hall and by windmills. We view Dordrecht from afar, standing in the Dutch lowlands, the home city of the painter: he frequently depicted it in the background of his pictures. The massive church is the Grote Kerk; farther to the left is the town-hall. The actual motif here, however, is not the vastness of the landscape, nor the skyline of the town, not even the enormous sky, but a climatic drama, which must often have inspired fear. From the left, heavy grey rain clouds sweep across the picture. Rain is falling in sheets, to the left of the church. To the right, the sky is still pale-blue. Lightning is striking, in precisely observed, thick yellow streaks and not in naively imagined zig-zags. The distant houses are lividly illuminated. In the foreground, cows (two of them seem to be spotlighted) and a horse patiently wait out the storm. This picture seems to occupy a special place in the winning of the natural landscape for painting. It is one of the first representations of the thunderstorm purely as a natural phenomenon independently of content (e.g. a destruction of Sodom). This is an early work by Cuyp, as shown by the yellowish-grey tone and heavy brush-work, betraying the influence of Jan van Goyen. Seeing this picture in 1834, John Constable exclaimed: &quot;truly sublime&quot;.&quot;<br><br>You can watch this paint in Cologne germany.

Executioners and victims face each other abruptly across a narrow space; according to Kenneth Clark, &quot;by a stroke of genius [Goya] has contrasted the fierce repetition of the soldiers&#039; attitudes and the steely line of their rifles, with the crumbling irregularity of their target.&quot; A square lantern situated on the ground between the two groups throws a dramatic light on the scene. The brightest illumination falls on the huddled victims to the left, whose numbers include a monk or friar in prayer. To the immediate right and at the center of the canvas, other condemned figures stand next in line to be shot. The central figure is the brilliantly lit man kneeling amid the bloodied corpses of those already executed, his arms flung wide in either appeal or defiance. His yellow and white clothing repeats the colors of the lantern. His plain white shirt and sun-burnt face show he is a simple laborer.<br><br>On the right side stands the firing squad, engulfed in shadow and painted as a monolithic unit. Seen nearly from behind, their bayonets and their shako headgear form a relentless and immutable column. Most of the faces of the figures cannot be seen, but the face of the man to the right of the main victim, peeping fearfully towards the soldiers, acts as a repoussoir at the back of the central group. Without distracting from the intensity of the foreground drama, a townscape with a steeple looms in the nocturnal distance, probably including the barracks used by the French. In the background between the hillside and the shakos is a crowd with torches: perhaps onlookers, perhaps more soldiers or victims.","filename":"Francisco Goya - The Third of May 1808","ext":".jpg","w":1280,"h":989,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":96,"tim":1490743273929,"time":1490743273,"md5":"gPK4ZvC5hVrlXLBgFn\/0qg==","fsize":206240,"resto":118689650,"id":"WKVCzEXJ","country":"US","m_img":1,"country_name":"United States"},{"no":118713922,"now":"03\/28\/17(Tue)19:26:17","name":"Anonymous","com":"Church visited Greece in 1869 and spent several weeks in Athens. There, he painted numerous studies and oil sketches of the ruins of the Parthenon that later served as the basis for this work. Although he intended to paint a large canvas of the Parthenon while still in Greece, it was not until 1871 that a commission from the financier and philanthropist Morris K. Jesup permitted Church to begin this large canvas. By February of that year, he was already at work on &quot;a big Parthenon&quot;. By May, he had apparently finished the painting and wrote of his concern for its proper lighting in Jesup&#039;s home. The picture was first exhibited in New York at Goupil&#039;s Gallery in 1872 where it was highly acclaimed. It appeared subsequently in many major exhibitions, including the Paris Exposition Universelle of 1878.","filename":"Frederic Edwin Church - The Parthenon","ext":".jpg","w":3753,"h":2289,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":76,"tim":1490743577750,"time":1490743577,"md5":"SA7BCNWVR0AdgOT8ZeuAMg==","fsize":1970292,"resto":118689650,"id":"WKVCzEXJ","country":"US","m_img":1,"country_name":"United States"},{"no":118714907,"now":"03\/28\/17(Tue)19:34:15","name":"Anonymous","com":"Bump for one of the best reasons to come to \/pol\/","filename":"Jan Matejko - Stanczyk, During a Ball at the Court","ext":".jpg","w":2465,"h":1835,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":93,"tim":1490744055100,"time":1490744055,"md5":"iIBoS+xDBSJsCnxWd50vVw==","fsize":1030920,"resto":118689650,"id":"WKVCzEXJ","country":"US","m_img":1,"country_name":"United States"},{"no":118715594,"now":"03\/28\/17(Tue)19:40:09","name":"Anonymous","com":"best threads on \/pol\/ tbqh.<br>the text on the tomb translates to something like &quot;i am even there in utopia&quot;, &quot;i&quot; being death","filename":"Nicolas_Poussin_-_Et_in_Arcadia_ego_(deuxi\u00e8me_version)","ext":".jpg","w":1280,"h":912,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":89,"tim":1490744409258,"time":1490744409,"md5":"2yY+CYQR79gY0292KgrcWg==","fsize":318177,"resto":118689650,"id":"4fnxeLQJ","country":"GB","m_img":1,"country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":118716077,"now":"03\/28\/17(Tue)19:43:30","name":"Anonymous","com":"Painted in 1645-1647<br><br>Teniers\u2019s talents as a still life painter, observer of folksy figures, and popular moralist are amply evident in this well preserved panel.

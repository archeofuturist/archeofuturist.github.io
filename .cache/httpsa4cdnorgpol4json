I&#039;ll be honest and say that pop music has started getting a bit better in recent years. Not better as in themes or anything, but they&#039;ve finally caught on to multisyllabic rhyming patterns (this really makes things a lot catchier) and broken out with typically unorthodox (for pop) instrumentation. Ariana Grande has a lot of trumpets and shit in some of her music. So even some of the instrumentation has become alright, although the greater feeling I have about that is that they wasted some pretty good notes on THIS (pop music) of all things.<br><br>But to summarize, radio top 40s should never be the case example for the state of music as an art; and music, &quot;the art,&quot; is very distinct from music, &quot;the industry,&quot; if you know what I&#039;m saying.

Atheism is merely the way 21st century people express their distaste for illogical iron age superstition. It\u00b4s a but not the only starting point. What\u00b4s more important is science but even that is only a stepping stone. Traditional religion will die out. That however doesn\u00b4t mean tradition needs to die out. To aknowledge biological human subspecies means to honour both science and tradition. The ideal future would be one of expanded consciousness, scientific marvels yet strong traditions and racial awareness.","filename":"Aryan_ascension","ext":".jpg","w":500,"h":386,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":96,"tim":1493846047692,"time":1493846047,"md5":"TXgEAcH1bHegPl8zhsp4TQ==","fsize":39666,"resto":123943271,"id":"7xwysP1w","country":"DE","country_name":"Germany"}]},{"posts":[{"no":123953439,"now":"05\/03\/17(Wed)15:53:14","name":"Anonymous","sub":"He \u2018Wants to Kill Us\u2019: Rachel Maddow Describes Her Bizarre Phone Call With Donald Trump","com":"<span class=\"quote\">&gt;\u201cThere\u2019s never been a president who is more addicted to news about himself and who\u2019s more response to the news that he supposedly thinks is so worthless,\u201d said Maddow \u201cSo it\u2019s a weird tension.

Essentially, antifa is being enticed into more violent guerrilla techniques. You&#039;ll start to see random bombing and terror campaigns in densely populated cities (think back to the Weather Underground, but far more destructive).<br><br>3. They are being aligned with well armed and trained insurgents, many of whom are refugees and members of Islamic State. <br><br>4. Expect to see them escalate quite soon as we approach the warmer Summer climate in the US. You will see less black blocs at rallies, and more decentralization and unpredictable violence. <br><br>5. 90% of antifa is comprised of unsuspecting young males. Many have mental disorders, are into heavy drug use, do not have fathers, have health problems\/STDs, are into prostitution and pornography to raise funds (&quot;sex work&quot;). They are prone to manipulation and have nothing to lose. <br><br>6. It&#039;s the core 10% that is guiding and managing. Trained insurgents entering as refugees, but more often rogue elements of CIA, trafficking cartels and university professors on CIA payroll.

This crippled the Roman empire because the Roman citizens began to see through the corruption of state power, so they quickly adopted the individualistic ethic of Christianity. The theological shift of Europe toward atheism in recent decades has let the citizens begin comfort in state power once more, leading to increased faith in a single European project. This tends to occur around periods of philosophical turmoil (e.g. democracy, problems emerging in monarchy and the church, the Reformation, etc.)<br><br>The end game of the current culture war that we see before us is actually beginning to take shape as the question of modern technology is settling at an exponential rate (the current discussions about the risks of technology are such things as virtual reality and genetic engineering, for example). All that remains to be seen is how lasting the atheistic movement is. If the West brings forward either 1. A Christian revival or 2. A new ethic which maintains the individual burden of the individual arises out of the death of God in living man&#039;s mind, then we can expect relative stability over the forseeable historical future (100 years? Probably less.) <br><br>Both of these events seem doubtful, unfortunately.","filename":"blocks path","ext":".jpg","w":981,"h":819,"tn_w":249,"tn_h":208,"tim":1493844891814,"time":1493844891,"md5":"SJLFqSH49xBogzpRvvDgpw==","fsize":185645,"resto":0,"id":"j1bLyfgA","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"check-em","country_name":"United States","replies":2,"images":0},{"no":123964460,"now":"05\/03\/17(Wed)17:09:01","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123962355\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123962355<\/a><br>It&#039;s too late to save the West.<br>It&#039;s time to destroy the west and rebuilt from the ground up<br><br>Nothing works in the west<br>The legal system is fucked<br>The education system is fucked<br>The employment system is fucked<br>The family unit is fucked<br>Western morality is fucked<br><br>The sooner the west collapses the better","time":1493845741,"resto":123962355,"id":"dc07hRHp","country":"IN","country_name":"India"},{"no":123965185,"now":"05\/03\/17(Wed)17:14:02","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123962355\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123962355<\/a><br><br>I agree.

The FAL is prohibited due to it&#039;s scary appearance and any AR variants are restricted due to muh black assault rifles. No one can really get a prohibited license anymore unless you&#039;re well connected or ex-military(even then I don&#039;t think it&#039;s a guarantee). With a restricted license you can own pistols (barrel length over 4.1&quot;) and the scary AR variants but you can only fire restricted weapons at approved ranges and you must go straight from your primary residence to the range. If you want to fuck around before or after you go to the range you need to get a temporary &quot;authorization to transport&quot; certificate. It&#039;s pretty gay because like another leaf mentioned, there&#039;s hardly anything to deal with when it comes to non-restricted guns. You can even carry a NR in public or in your vehicle as long as it&#039;s unloaded.<br><br>Canada&#039;s gun laws are fucked. Some of the controls in place make a lot of sense, like the mandatory 5 year safety courses, the daily automated record checks, and some of the storage rules but magazine limits and restricting guns solely on their appearance is retarded. Sometimes an &quot;aggressive&quot; name or logo on a gun will be all it takes to make the gun prohibited like the cz858 &#039;Spartan&#039; Rifle.","time":1490903020,"resto":118934170,"id":"1G4N3eEe","country":"CA","country_name":"Canada"}]}]}

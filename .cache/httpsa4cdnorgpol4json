And i want you to suffer and be tormented and to be tortured and to be defiled.. but wait wait wait.. i&#039;m not asking that you just be done that to you without a cause, only to the extent that you have caused such affliction for others no more no less.. i&#039;m not being inhuman here only seeing it through the lense of justice, even today you don&#039;t feel a thing or have any empathy for it and your wicked pathetic schemes that you think will come true.. you exhalt yourself with a doctrine that wasn&#039;t even about you, so you had to enact talmudic perversions &quot;interpretations&quot; that are ugly as fuck based on some idiotic justification that it was necessary, when what it really did was give the priest class authority to interpret.. you cunts are pathetic, there&#039;s nothing that you are that are genuine, you didn&#039;t even continue to be a christian which was what your faith was leading to when messiah come, you have power and money but you are literally so fucking dumb that you can&#039;t see that jesus fullfills the suffering messiah and the king in two stages instead of at the same time. Truly the jewish mind is incredibly dumb not intelligent as it is portrayed, and only held up by money and power to elevate their status. They are far from intelligent.","time":1492752477,"resto":122083612,"id":"KOM9PWik","country":"DK","country_name":"Denmark"}]},{"posts":[{"no":122086550,"now":"04\/20\/17(Thu)23:03:40","name":"Anonymous","sub":"We need to ban smartphones","com":"<span class=\"quote\">&gt;be me birthdayboy<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;invite family to expensive 5* restaurant (200$pp)<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;see 10yo nephew playing on his phone<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;strike conversation; hey dude you like the food? hows school like btw? bla bla<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;yeah<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;yeah<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;yeah<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;*continues texting*<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;his probably shy lets talk to my bro instead<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;mid conversation his phone vibrates <\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;oh woops its my gf need to talk to her for a bit brb<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;try to talk to others but everyone is busy uploading food pics or selfies to instagram, facebooking, twittering or w\/e the hell millennials do these days<\/span><br><br>How do we solve the phone problem \/pol\/?

A study published in the British Journal of Cancer, conducted by the Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology at Complutense University in Madrid, determined that Tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) and other cannabinoids inhibit tumour growth. They were responsible for the first clinical study aimed at assessing cannabinoid antitumoral action. Cannabinoid delivery was safe and was achieved with zero psychoactive effects. THC was found to decrease tumour cells in two out of the nine patients.<br><br><br>2. A study published in The Journal of Neuroscience examined the biochemical events in both acute neuronal damage and in slowly progressive, neurodegenerative diseases. They conducted a magnetic resonance imaging study that looked at THC (the main active compound in marijuana) and found that it reduced neuronal injury in rats. The results of this study provide evidence that the cannabinoid system can serve to protect the brain against neurodegeneration.<br><br>3. A study published in The Journal of Pharmacology And Experimental Therapeutics already acknowledged the fact that cannabinoids have been shown to possess antitumor properties. This study examined the effect of cannabidiol (CBD, non-psychoactive cannabinoid compound)on human glioma cell lines. The addition of cannabidiol led to a dramatic drop in the viability of glioma cells Glioma is the word used to describe brain tumour. The study concluded that cannabidiol was able to produce a significant antitumor activity.<br><br>4. A study published in the journal Molecular Cancer Therapeutics outlines how brain tumours are highly resistant to current anticancer treatments, which makes it crucial to find new therapeutic strategies aimed at improving the poor prognosis of patients suffering from this disease. This study also demonstrated the reversal of tumour activity in Glioblastoma multiforme.<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;http:\/\/www.collective-evolution.co<wbr>m\/2013\/08\/23\/20-medical-studies-tha<wbr>t-prove-cannabis-can-cure-cancer\/<\/span>","filename":"pepeSunlight","ext":".png","w":1269,"h":800,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":78,"tim":1492750796280,"time":1492750796,"md5":"sBLcocXC6EeO64ibfS8Mmw==","fsize":1079549,"resto":122096007,"id":"hjBCnwF0","country":"US","m_img":1,"country_name":"United States"},{"no":122099384,"now":"04\/21\/17(Fri)01:06:36","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122098448\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122098448<\/a><br>probably yeah","filename":"moonrock","ext":".jpg","w":1000,"h":1000,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":125,"tim":1492751196772,"time":1492751196,"md5":"81Zv2xIs2lNM6oHR1Uw3bg==","fsize":285508,"resto":122096007,"id":"0m2hryxE","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":122100083,"now":"04\/21\/17(Fri)01:13:46","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122098749\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122098749<\/a><br>hurr smoke up broo 420 weed man haha it&#039;ll cure the cancer you don&#039;t have broo no negative side effects haha weeeed<br><br>get a grip.<br>https:\/\/pastebin com\/iPfkVAim","filename":"image","ext":".png","w":498,"h":377,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":94,"tim":1492751626217,"time":1492751626,"md5":"\/Pm6BcZVUdlMcioGUnZjVw==","fsize":262476,"resto":122096007,"id":"jna+N68d","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":122101415,"now":"04\/21\/17(Fri)01:27:46","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122100083\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122100083<\/a><br>You take life to seriously, its just a drug you pussy, what makes you so fucking important","time":1492752466,"resto":122096007,"id":"FL7It80h","country":"US","country_name":"United States"}]}]}

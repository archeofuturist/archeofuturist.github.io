It\u2019s not a fucking puzzle, all the history is on the sites. There you crossed ur nerdy hobbies with ur nerdy resentment. Bunch of fucking nerds with your dipshit teenage beefs probably started with a resentment of woman who won\u2019t speak to you and now you think you have become POI radicalized.<br>So how did it happen? How did you become a fucking nazi? A bunch of real Nazis whispered poison in your ears while becoming your only community, your only \u201cfriends\u201d. And they used multiple levels to make irony and bigotry and fascism more acceptable by drowning it in \u201coh we\u2019re just joking\u201d So you combine all this with capitalizing on isolated nerd dude resentment and even deeper isolation, BAM nazi.<br>You can talk to any former \u201cchan\u201d boy and they can tell you how it went from \u201cshotty shock humor\u201d to \u201cwhite supremacist recruitment\u201d. The \u201clol only normies care about hurting others attitude\u201d + the general nerd male resentment of these communities. Its prime fertile ground for actual Nazis to grow. People talk about pol, but you need to see the various communities converge. R9K\u2019s \u201cwho wont woman fuck me\u201d bs \u201canything goes and anyone who gets mad is just a normie\u201d vs endless outbursts of anger at everything. Pol here becomes less of an isolated phenomenon and more of a natural end point for all these circles crashing into one another. And pol, also being its own thing, emans it is rolled back into those communities amplifying your worst aspect then roll it back into pol.<br>So essentially you have an online pressure cooker to turn your typical teenage nerdy bullshit into honest to god fascism. The surrounding of hateful idedas, the detachment from the harm you do? Turning them into \u201cjust jokes\u201d becoming your only friends and that just your community you can see it in many others but again your not a fucking mystery","filename":"Instagram-ec24fc","ext":".png","w":498,"h":275,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":138,"tim":1492080220830,"time":1492080220,"md5":"ozYJdD\/Vp8sxWkc\/2meSaw==","fsize":241408,"resto":0,"id":"UtGU6HUn","country":"NZ","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"what-did-he-mean-by-this","country_name":"New Zealand","replies":63,"images":12,"omitted_posts":58,"omitted_images":12},{"no":120903246,"now":"04\/13\/17(Thu)08:16:54","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120895848\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120895848<\/a>","filename":"anon bait","ext":".png","w":500,"h":288,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":72,"tim":1492085814039,"time":1492085814,"md5":"4a98F85rtkqzbRhiJ0IsOw==","fsize":96575,"resto":120895848,"id":"o++AlehZ","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":120903601,"now":"04\/13\/17(Thu)08:21:18","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120901994\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120901994<\/a><br>Lmao<br>He is literally a furry how can he even INSULT someone when he is a mockery of himself.","time":1492086078,"resto":120895848,"id":"rqvEEOCl","country":"RO","country_name":"Romania"},{"no":120903703,"now":"04\/13\/17(Thu)08:22:31","name":"Anonymous","com":"Shia is a shitty Jew actor who got work through nepotism and spreading his cheeks. <br>He &amp; Amy Shumer represent everything \/pol\/ hates.<br>Both would be in stocks having vegetables thrown at them for being mental cases in normal societies.<br>In todays degenerate world they are &#039;respected artists&#039;...","time":1492086151,"resto":120895848,"id":"2\/DMDFBb","country":"AU","country_name":"Australia"},{"no":120903776,"now":"04\/13\/17(Thu)08:23:23","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120897428\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120897428<\/a><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Hiding out in a cuck shed will accomplish something<\/span><br><br>Nazis watch out","time":1492086203,"resto":120895848,"id":"seMMIyBi","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":120904188,"now":"04\/13\/17(Thu)08:28:29","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120900846\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120900846<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;implying<\/span><br>I have been a traditionalist my whole life, because that&#039;s how my parents educated me.

In a nutshell<br>a)people who come to italy are different. In the north eastxwe have a flux of folks from afghanistan, pakistan, syria. In the south there is a huge flux of africans. After the death of ghaddafi, the flhx started. He was the one who blocked them.<br>Anyways, they roman free in the cities, i know people who teach italian to these people but classes are usually almost empty. Yes they have iphones. No nobodyfines them if they do not have a bus ticket. You can see them mostly shopping in a grocery store group of supermarkets named LIDL, which is german. I am assuming they five them free coupons to shop there. Or somethimf. They get \u20ac30-40 of cash per day. The other expenses like food, clothes, efc are all already covered by specific companies who host fhese people in specific buildings (nice buildings, i will be honest with you. They do not lice in slums. They are treated like actual human beings here in the north). These companies get funded by the government. also they pay almost no taxes.<br>They DO molest women from time to time. There has been an almost rape many times. Two that I know of surely. I have been seeing the same faces for years desu. These people are not looking for jobs. I guess the long term plan is moving to a country that will support them for an even longer amount of time,like france or sweden.<br><br>How do people feel about them:<br>older people: Empathic.

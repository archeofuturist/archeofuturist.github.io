In Taiwan, where Lim was born, all of his siblings have bidets as well. \u201cIt looks strange if you don\u2019t have it,\u201d Lim told Fox News.<br><br>A bidet is a plumbing fixture or sink used for washing genitalia and, while widely used in places like Asia, the Middle East, and Europe, they are not customary in the United States.<br><br>A bidet to put it simply is a what should clean your rear end after the food you ate exits your body. Instead of toilet paper a bidet shoots a stream of water in order to clean your butt. If you had mud on your driveway would you rather wipe it off with newspaper or take out the pressure washer?<br><br>The idea of using a bidet may be foreign to many Americans but it the norm in many countries. Did you know that 97% of homes in Italy have a bidet? Other European countries and Japan also has a very high rate of bidet use.<br><br>Many countries are just starting to widely use toilets, in fact 70% of people in India do not have access to a toilet.

Similarly, the number of Muslim immigrants is also rising. According to official state data, some 240,000 immigrants enter Russia annually \u2014 Russia&#039;s Center for Migration Studies puts this number at more than 400,000 after accounting for illegal immigration. Federal Migration Service head Konstantin Romodanovsky has said 3 million immigrants work illegally in Russia every year.<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;More Muslim immigrants are making their way into Russia, driven by economic downturns in their own countries. Though official state data indicates that approximately 240,000 immigrants enter Russia each year, Russia&#039;s Center for Migration Studies puts this number at more than 400,000, factoring in illegal immigration. Most immigrants come from the Central Asian states and Azerbaijan, according to Rosstat. Russia already hosts the second-largest number of migrants after the United States, some 11 million or nearly 8 percent of the population. According to an investigation by Russkaya Gazeta, about 30 percent of students in Russia will be children of immigrants or guest workers by 2020.<\/span>","time":1492654378,"resto":121927103,"id":"GOOtJNNJ","country":"RU","country_name":"Russian Federation"},{"no":121936417,"now":"04\/19\/17(Wed)22:13:32","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121936189\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121936189<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Ad hominem<\/span><br>Didn&#039;t expect more from you.","filename":"1478145554","ext":".jpg","w":750,"h":422,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":70,"tim":1492654412520,"time":1492654412,"md5":"vWn5CseoqmJ9kE+7DxLP4g==","fsize":56930,"resto":121927103,"id":"PUm8afJU","country":"RU","country_name":"Russian Federation"},{"no":121936428,"now":"04\/19\/17(Wed)22:13:38","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121936154\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121936154<\/a><br>You write in English now, moron.","time":1492654418,"resto":121927103,"id":"GOOtJNNJ","country":"RU","country_name":"Russian Federation"},{"no":121937894,"now":"04\/19\/17(Wed)22:25:43","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121933279\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121933279<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;2ch<\/span><br>Filthy gipsy Abu still in power there?","time":1492655143,"resto":121927103,"id":"PUm8afJU","country":"RU","country_name":"Russian Federation"},{"no":121938240,"now":"04\/19\/17(Wed)22:28:41","name":"Anonymous","com":"Can one of you help clarify what&#039;s going on in the Russian Federation right now?

Communist attacks on Nazis grew in intensity, and streetfighting soon commenced (going from barroom brawls to fighting with clubs to finally shooting at each other).

Kind of a moot point.<br><br>The adoption point makes sense, but then we get into the intricacies. Adoption itself is already a necessary evil that shouldn&#039;t happen, straight couples might be better for the children, gay men deliberately giving sperm to a woman to carry a baby for them, etc. Social dynamics and implications that go way beyond the surface level stuff. And please don&#039;t just disregard that with &quot;there are no implications&quot;, there ARE.

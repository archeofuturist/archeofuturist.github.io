Started taking 5-6g and felt great, been using it regularly since. Really negates my anxiety and depression like nothing else, but I&#039;m sure my liver is rotting more than it already was from my alcoholism. It gives some euphoria effects similar to alcohol but without destroying your ability to function like alcohol or weed.<br><br>It&#039;s definitely got high addiction potential but it&#039;s more of a money sink than a threat to society. I don&#039;t see anybody being hurt by kratom use or users, it&#039;s just one of many things to waste your money on.<br><br>Even if making it illegal would do anything to stop people from using it, there&#039;s a lot worse drugs to try to rein in. It&#039;s a fool&#039;s errand though, imo. Best you can do is try to reach addicts with the message that drugs are degenerate.","time":1492873111,"resto":122279547,"id":"saHicPN7","country":"CA","country_name":"Canada"},{"no":122286068,"now":"04\/22\/17(Sat)11:07:05","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122281070\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122281070<\/a><br><br>We all have our vices<br>I just don&#039;t want to lose a friend","time":1492873625,"resto":122279547,"id":"FY\/MiRYn","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":122286718,"now":"04\/22\/17(Sat)11:13:08","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122285150\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122285150<\/a><br>I buy a kilogram or more at a time from an online supplier at a price of about 100 dollars.

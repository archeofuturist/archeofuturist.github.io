While in the 1860s they may have been worried of European invasion on the heels of the civil war, or the French in Mexico starting something, by the 1870s we were very much secure and happy to just move westward and keep Brits\/Canadians out of Oregon. We certainly were not going to be sending any troops to the European continent while still basically in the age of sail, and German troops in America would only slightly speed up Manifest Destiny.","time":1493477804,"resto":123338401,"id":"DgMWdjwF","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":123340715,"now":"04\/29\/17(Sat)10:58:27","name":"Anonymous","com":"<span class=\"quote\">&gt;whites killed each other off so niggers and chinks could rule over them<\/span>","time":1493477907,"resto":123338401,"id":"u3Bl\/HFd","country":"US","country_name":"United States"}]},{"posts":[{"no":123340189,"now":"04\/29\/17(Sat)10:53:12","name":"Anonymous","com":"Ultimate triggering <br>We redpill her and take her back. <br>Impossible?

They dont mean sex. Sex is being born a man or a woman. Having a dick or a vagina. What people mean by gender is your identity. Its basically you personality. Its what you do. Like if you enjoy wearing lipstick and high heels. That is you personality. Which means you can make a word your personality since nobody is the same. Everyone is an individual which means that there is one gender for each person as long as you are willing to specify your exact personality as a gender. This is why I dont understand why people care about Gender. It not relevant in any situation unless you are talking to a close friend, and then there would still be no need for a word to describe your friends clothes, sexual preference etc. Sex is relevant when you go to the doctor and he needs to know weather you have a uterus or not.

That conclusion is that we really fucking need Christianity. I&#039;m actually an atheist, but I&#039;ve thought quite a while on this, and this is the conclusion I&#039;ve come to. Everything is shitty in the way it is right now thanks to religion going out of style. As much as the bible is filled with authoritarian bullshit...some of that bullshit is highly potent truth about maintaining society. It is entirely possible to live without a bible to guide you and still have strong morals and understanding of values in society, however it is not a given. I think many attempting to think freely reach this state...they think a little bit about religion, and realize 1) theres some bullshit, and 2) some of it is restrictive. The automatic reaction is to fully reject religion. Unfortunately it seems most stop there, they don&#039;t continue to contemplate about the idea of God, or the point of humanities existence etc etc.<br>This, combined with innate instinctual desire to see humanity succeed, creates your typical liberal atheist: A person who doesn&#039;t give the slightest fuck about religion, and likely a loose understanding of morals.<br><br>Given all I&#039;ve learned about religion and Christianity...I&#039;ve concluded we desperately need religion, and Christianity is the absolute best one, most likely to be the most successful and lead to the best most civilized world. I do think eventually religion will be obsolete. Perhaps in a world with less anti-intellectualism, less propaganda, and better education.<br><br>For the time being tho, yall need Jesus.<br><br>I&#039;m probable going to start going to church, and you should too.","filename":"1492112304104","ext":".jpg","w":398,"h":900,"tn_w":110,"tn_h":250,"tim":1492128217774,"time":1492128217,"md5":"3PXouZA1chaIYBSZCuAmHA==","fsize":19749,"resto":0,"id":"dVyjKeGj","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"christian-atheism","country_name":"United States","replies":43,"images":11,"omitted_posts":38,"omitted_images":10},{"no":120999152,"now":"04\/13\/17(Thu)21:42:12","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120986333\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120986333<\/a><br>i reached the same conclusion myself.

Christian men would work night and day in order to provide for the family and would often not make Sunday services because the fact of the matter is this: men are workers. This would lead to a shift in the demographics that is clearly seen today: the most feminized men would often acquire high-level clergy positions while the masculine men tended the crops and animals: these feminized men would then have to craft their services to appeal to the women. Give or take 200 years and a greater demographic shift and we have our modern-day ineffectual modern day Christianity: the Christianity that cucks out and goes with the flow of culture instead of shaping the culture beneath its feet. Passages and key points such as Christians being the &quot;Bride&quot; of Christ have been romanticized to fit the feminine persona but have done so by sacrificing the masculine lamb. No where in the Bible does it ever say &quot;Fall into a deeper intimate relationship with Jesus&quot;; but it does say that He loves us and for us to die for Him if it comes to that. Who the FUCK do you think I am? I am a man; I was created for battle, my hands grasp the sword; I hunger for blood. God has called us into battle with evil and yet many Christians walk around in the battlefield without a clue in the world. Look at men like King David of the Old Testament: a dirty rotten sinner and one of, if not THE bloodiest warrior of the Old Testament: yet God called him a &quot;man after [His] own heart&quot;. What happened to THAT glory? Can Christian Masculinity be salvaged?","filename":"IMG_7088","ext":".jpg","w":223,"h":226,"tn_w":123,"tn_h":125,"tim":1492134559538,"time":1492134559,"md5":"fPGn7\/IBGOq0bmXkfokjag==","fsize":27499,"resto":120986333,"id":"G53AZ2xD","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":121000801,"now":"04\/13\/17(Thu)21:55:01","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121000035\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121000035<\/a><br><a href=\"#p120991462\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120991462<\/a><br>Not without a strong sense of nationalism and belonging; Christians should be fiercely devoted to God, the Kingdom, and one another and that example should bleed into our relationships with our leaders, people, and nation. Luther had his reformation to get the Church back on track in the 1400s and it did for a while; but no one listened in his later years when he named the men responsible behind the corporatization behind Christianity\/Catholicism: the Jews. Remember when Jesus whipped the Jews out of His synagogue? Or when the Jews killed Jesus? Or when the Jews persecuted and murdered Christians in the streets for hundreds of years?

See the passion we have, the faith that sustains us. If you can find a hymnal and read the old songs. See how we love. I have studied many worldviews and religions and agree that even on an exclusively logical basis Christianity gets us closest to our best state, as it calls for high standards of behavior, helping one another, and if necessary being ready to defend oneself. What I really hope you see however, is God Himself. It is hard for the logically minded to come to faith. I do not think any words I have can move you.

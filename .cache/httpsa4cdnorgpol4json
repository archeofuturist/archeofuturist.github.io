You simply can&#039;t afford that either. And those that have some education take jobs away from native swedes who otherwise would need them. Then they have higher birthrates because that&#039;s what they do in their neck of the woods, which is part of why they are poor back in their own nations..

But I will remind you of the Jews who controlled a large part the shipping industries that participated in the Atlantic Slave Trade. I will also remind you that the African economy was built on the money they collected from selling their people. Slavery was wrong as we put too much reliance on another race and brought them into our nation. Without slavery we would have been forced to automate sooner and would have advanced more quickly. Also turning loose that number of slaves without a plan was foolish. What would have been cheaper in the long run would be to build towns in Africa and then release the slaves to govern themselves.","time":1491232365,"resto":119309194,"id":"kx0hD\/j\/","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":119338288,"now":"04\/03\/17(Mon)11:13:45","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119336203\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119336203<\/a><br>We &quot;need&quot; more assimilating immigrants.<br><br>Ideally, we wouldn&#039;t take in more immigrants because fuck off we&#039;re full; but, if they&#039;re to come, they should assimilate.","time":1491232425,"resto":119309194,"id":"\/esvQLPB","country":"US","country_name":"United States"}]},{"posts":[{"no":119311625,"now":"04\/03\/17(Mon)05:42:37","name":"Anonymous","com":"It&#039;s Nigel&#039;s birthday!<br>He&#039;s 53 today.<br><br>Say happy birthday, Nigel","filename":"17760135_1302911323089801_7706121803246006246_n","ext":".jpg","w":720,"h":960,"tn_w":187,"tn_h":250,"tim":1491212557697,"time":1491212557,"md5":"uPVbBiwuflsNTVbCq1lYnA==","fsize":76610,"resto":0,"id":"t8Xl9a1+","country":"AU","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"its-nigels-birthday","country_name":"Australia","replies":254,"images":60,"omitted_posts":249,"omitted_images":60,"tail_size":50},{"no":119337628,"now":"04\/03\/17(Mon)11:07:09","name":"Anonymous","com":"Happy birthday Nige!!!!","time":1491232029,"resto":119311625,"id":"kizh6Lmc","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":119337793,"now":"04\/03\/17(Mon)11:08:50","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119318213\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119318213<\/a><br>Always one faggot who shits on the floor, but jokes on you fellowship will not befalk you here, you are a sideshow to be mocked, a freak for our amusement. <br><br>Eventually you&#039;ll reason with yourself that being a freak is all you&#039;ll become, then one day it&#039;ll happen.

IRCC continued to be successful in promoting the use of multiple-entry visas, which are valid for up to 10 years and allow applicants from visa-required countries to travel to Canada more frequently and on their own schedules. In 2015, a total of 1,231,041 multiple-entry visas were issued, which was a 21% increase from 2014. Effective February 6, 2014, a policy change automatically considered visitors to Canada eligible for a multiple-entry visa.

The left want to take down the 1% elite.<br>The Nazi&#039;s were obsessed about race and weaponize it to gain power of Germany. Liberals are obsessed about race and weaponize it to gain power in western countries.<br>Nazi&#039;s blamed everything on the Jews, Leftist blame everything on white men.<br>Nazi&#039;s had higher taxation for the middle and upper classes it could be 50% of their wealth for conquered people it was 100% to fund their government programs, The left gives higher taxation to fund their retarded government programs.<br>Nazi&#039;s are pro abortion, The left are pro abortion.<br><br>True Right wing conservatives want small government and oppose tyranny, We promote capitalism and see the benefits of a free market not heavily regulated, We are NOT socialist and believe that that government taxation should be minimized and not be so high. National Socialism is a direct contradiction to what the right believes and is way more Left wing than right wing.","filename":"LiterallyHitler","ext":".jpg","w":480,"h":360,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":187,"tim":1491228299950,"time":1491228299,"md5":"RYhaoCT454QxgikofLgS5A==","fsize":15810,"resto":0,"id":"TDy9Ew5n","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"nazism-is-left-wing","country_name":"United States","replies":44,"images":6,"omitted_posts":39,"omitted_images":6},{"no":119337742,"now":"04\/03\/17(Mon)11:08:21","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119336895\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119336895<\/a><br>Getting gibs and killing defenceless civilians is way better than hiding in Argentina and having to work for a living, on that we all agree.<br><a href=\"#p119336547\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119336547<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt; Germany boomed under the nazi rule<\/span><br>Only the military sector for obvious reasons, funded by stolen valuables that we kindly exchanged for hard, Swiss currency.

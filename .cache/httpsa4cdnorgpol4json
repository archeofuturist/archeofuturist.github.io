We always have fought for a better future, instead of just relaxing and letting other people tell us what was good for us. A very troublesome trait, this determination to be masters of our own destiny, this determination to live in accord with our innate values instead of someone else\u2019s, this determination to hang onto our traditions and our life-style and to do things our way. This troublesome trait of ours is really a big obstacle to the planners of the New World Order, who want us just to relax and not struggle while they mix us with negroes, semites and asians to produce the nice, coffee-colored blend preferred by the likes of the EU, a blend without Racial Traditions or Racial habits or Racial ambitions to shape our own Destiny.<br><br>So why do we not want to be blended? Why do we insist on remaining a Race of conquerors, inventors, and builders; a Race of explorers; a Race of poets, philosophers, and dreamers; a proud Race, an independent Race, a Race with our own Traditions, instead of the agreeable, placid race of coffee-colored consumers and couch potatoes those nice jews in the media and those nice politicians in Brussels want us to be? And I guess that the best answer to that question is that that\u2019s just the way we are. That\u2019s our God-given Nature, and we want to keep it. In fact, we are determined to keep it, and by God, we\u2019ll send all of those who try to take it away from us straight to Hell.","filename":"IMG_1554","ext":".jpg","w":480,"h":361,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":94,"tim":1490089663318,"time":1490089663,"md5":"9HghQjpM0HiCyrRRmJCsRA==","fsize":56973,"resto":117582470,"id":"EapYn4ck","country":"IL","country_name":"Israel"},{"no":117610713,"now":"03\/21\/17(Tue)05:59:55","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p117607727\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;117607727<\/a><br>I&#039;m white mate.","time":1490090395,"resto":117582470,"id":"QAd\/6jT2","country":"AU","country_name":"Australia"},{"no":117611492,"now":"03\/21\/17(Tue)06:13:17","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p117607937\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;117607937<\/a><br>in NZ we can play a game: find a dairy, piss shop, or a fruit and veg that isnt owned by poos or chinks<br><br>protip: you lose every time.","time":1490091197,"resto":117582470,"id":"gicEcdPb","country":"NZ","country_name":"New Zealand"},{"no":117612126,"now":"03\/21\/17(Tue)06:24:12","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p117582470\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;117582470<\/a><br>\/pol\/ whities keep complaining about the &quot;preservation of the white race&quot; and blaming Sweden for opening the floodgates of Islamic immigrants.

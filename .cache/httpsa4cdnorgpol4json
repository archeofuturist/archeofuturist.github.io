The former are usually regal, majestic, beautiful people. The most beautiful people on Earth. They built civilization with their ingenuity, perseverance, and general cognitive superiority. The latter are usually Southern mongrels with deformed bone structures, unusual musculature, strange facial features, thin and disgusting hair which is usually falling out even in their women, and curdled cottage cheese like skin. Mentally they are unusually dull, seemingly retarded in many ways. They amount to practically nothing financially\/professionally and generally resort to stealing Social Security checks from their elders while all living under the same rented roof. The best I can tell is that they have been banging their relatives for generations and exposing themselves to all sorts of chemicals. They are the modern day peasantry.

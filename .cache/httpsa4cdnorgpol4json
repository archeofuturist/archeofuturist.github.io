throwing the &#039;secret baby&#039; out of a second-floor window has walked free and been given probation. <\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Antonia Lopez gave birth in secret in her Omaha, Nebraska, bedroom on September 30, 2016, before throwing the baby out the window and soliciting help in getting rid of the body on Facebook.<\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;The baby, who was about two months premature, suffered fatal injuries when she hit the ground. <\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;She was originally charged as an adult but entered a plea of admission after her case was moved to the juvenile court.<\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;On Friday a judge sentenced her to probation, ordered her to live in a group home, take part in individual and family therapy and perform 50 hours of community service.<\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Judge Christopher Kelly also ordered her to delete her Facebook account.<\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;The Omaha World-Herald reported that Lopez&#039;s defense attorney, Rebecca McClung, told the court: &#039;She&#039;s coping the best she can.

The grandmother is coping the best she can.&#039;<\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Lopez denied knowing she was pregnant but messages on her Snapchat and Facebook accounts suggested she did realize and kept it hidden for months. <\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;McClung told the court Lopez had thought the child was stillborn. <\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Douglas County Attorney Don Kleine, whose office agreed to move the case down to the juvenile court based on Lopez&#039;s mental state and the lack of a criminal history, said the teen&#039;s reaction was not premeditated.<\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;He said: &#039;It wasn&#039;t a planned-out, thought-out process.

I know Hispanics chicks at each extreme. <br><br>Sidenote, can we focus on hating niggers? Hispanics are certainly not White \/ East Asian tier, but they are about 6 million times closer to our standards than blacks. Whenever I see people going after Hispanics, is feels like a jew-trick to divide our resistance. Of course, you can be anti-illegal immigration (that is just common fucking sense). But where I live (Southwest) there are Hispanics that have lived in the USA far longer than Whites. It is easy to forget that many have blood lines that go back to before the Revolution (Spain was once a relevant nation that did much of the New World exploration). Even among the ones that came to our land afterwards, millions have done so legally, and contribute to our GDP quite nicely. <br><br>Look, I&#039;m not saying not to hate people.

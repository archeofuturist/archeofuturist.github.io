The man, who has been named as Ziyed Ben Belgacem, is seen struggling with a soldier for more than a minute before help arrives. Belgacem, a 39-year-old French citizen, held an air pistol to the soldier&#039;s head and used her as a shield. Police believe he intended to use the soldier\u2019s weapon to shoot members of the public. The soldier\u2019s colleague intervened and fired three bursts, shooting Belgacem dead.","filename":"20170321001300822738-original","ext":".jpg","w":704,"h":396,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":140,"tim":1490081814384,"time":1490081814,"md5":"4b4rRU83Ay9SCrM7dWeHIQ==","fsize":40208,"resto":0,"id":"lMNCOW8+","country":"AU","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"french-airport-muslim-terror-attack-female","country_name":"Australia","replies":292,"images":63,"omitted_posts":287,"omitted_images":60,"tail_size":50},{"no":117623886,"now":"03\/21\/17(Tue)09:26:55","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p117601862\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;117601862<\/a><br>Just think how vulnerable Swedes and Germans are to this shit considering that most of their police officers are female.","time":1490102815,"resto":117601862,"id":"JAIVs7Bf","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":117623889,"now":"03\/21\/17(Tue)09:26:59","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p117608231\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;117608231<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Cate<wbr>gory:Mixed_sports<\/span><br>These things are sports............mixed...sports...<wbr><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Even<wbr>ting<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Floo<wbr>rball<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Korf<wbr>ball<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Fris<wbr>bee<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Quid<wbr>ditch_(sport)<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Whee<wbr>lchair_rugby<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Unde<wbr>rwater_hockey<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Whee<wbr>lchair_rugby<\/span><br>I don&#039;t think I can unsee the gayness.<br>But wait!<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Ulti<wbr>mate_(sport)<\/span>","time":1490102819,"resto":117601862,"id":"9gCpQTIc","country":"RO","country_name":"Romania"},{"no":117623904,"now":"03\/21\/17(Tue)09:27:12","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p117622632\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;117622632<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;arm wrestling as measurement of strength<\/span><br><br>why do ppl still fall for this?","time":1490102832,"resto":117601862,"id":"8bW1NAax","country":"HU","country_name":"Hungary"},{"no":117623917,"now":"03\/21\/17(Tue)09:27:23","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p117622592\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;117622592<\/a><br>Testosterone.

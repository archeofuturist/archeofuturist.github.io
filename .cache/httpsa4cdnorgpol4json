A lot of people are losing their minds and calling him a sellout while not understanding that Alex is legally liable for the things he says unlike faggots commenting on youtube videos. It should be obvious to people that the apology was made under duress and was a neccessary strategic move for infowars. <br><br>People are getting caught up in purity tests instead of focusing on victory over the globalists. Trump has never mentioned pizzagate of elite pedophile networks, does that make him a sellout? Of course not, he isn&#039;t in a position where he can say things like that and I think everyone understands,so why can&#039;t these same people understand the position that Alex is in?<br><br>Every attempt to divide the right needs to be resisted regardless of how you feel about the individual being attacked.

I had many girlfriends until i was 24 when i suffered an enormous amount of bad luck and life issues. Lost friends, suffered crippling depression, anxiety and all sorts of shit mounted over the following few years. Only began masturbating during this time as i would normally just be sexually aggressive with my gfs. However when i randomly and without real warning came to a bit of a fiddle i became instantly hooked. However unlike most are saying here, it did not reduce my ability with women, however my perception on activities was definitely effected. But all for the better of my relationships. However my major issue is that i fap about 3-4 times every day non-stop for the past 6 years, i never miss a day and it is almost impossible for me not to crack one off. I even do it in my sleep. When people say &#039;Just stop it&#039;, you underestimate just how hard it can be for some people. I have beaten smoking head on no alternatives and i smoked for 11 years. I have a very strong will power but with regards to porn and fapping i find it absolutely impossible for me. So my request is for advice on how to replace my urges and any methods to stopping?

In the end two French agents were shot (one in the foot and the other in the leg) and a third suffered a broken nose. The remaining two managed to escape on foot under the cover of darkness. The unharmed villagers confiscated computers, diving equipment, professional cameras, and even a parachute in the vehicle.

The glans is NOT the most sensual part of the penis and is primarily innervated with pain-sensitive free nerve endings.<br><br>The majority of a male&#039;s erogenous encapsulated nerve endings are in the preputial tissue itself, especially the frenulum (often removed and invariably damaged during circumcision) and the ridged band.<br><br>On top of that, though, there are many forms of female circumcision, some of which don&#039;t even involve cutting off the glans clitoridis at all. Some forms are as &quot;mild&quot; as just drawing a single drop of blood from the clitoris or clitoral hood--and yet even these forms are banned in the US since 1997.<br><br>http:\/\/www.circumstitions.com\/Docs\/<wbr>KNMG-policy.pdf<br><br>What we have going on in the US is a situation in which girls have complete protection from circumcision (even symbolic, non mutilating forms that draw just one drop of blood), but male scan be circumcised extremely, even to the point that they experience an extreme loss of primary erogenous tissue and can experience lifelong pain, bleeding, and narrowing of the urethral meatus.<br><br>This situation is itself illegal as it violates the guarantee of equal protection under the law, and there have been legal experts who published articles in law journals explaining this.<br><br>https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed<wbr>\/27338602","filename":"454345","ext":".png","w":479,"h":483,"tn_w":123,"tn_h":125,"tim":1491951357320,"time":1491951357,"md5":"oSr7rkbAp1WFIARHghcaVQ==","fsize":290416,"resto":120663950,"id":"3224DckO","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":120672474,"now":"04\/11\/17(Tue)18:56:43","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120670572\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120670572<\/a><br><a href=\"#p120671312\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120671312<\/a><br>The majority of female circumcisions are not full infibulation. In Malaysia female circumcisions are usually much less severe than male circumcisions, as they only remove part of the clitoral hood.

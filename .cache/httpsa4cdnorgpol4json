They learned a while back that to kill a pundit you make a claim then go to the advertisers. As soon as advertisers pull funding the network has to remove the pundit to make money. It&#039;s incredibly effective. One of the earliest guys they did this to was Glenn Beck. I never liked the guy but David Brock is much, much worse. Brock bragged openly at the time how he got Beck fired from FOX. In recent times they did this Ailes and they did it to O&quot;Reilly. No idea how to stop it from happening though.<\/span><br><br>It&#039;s just as likely Murdoch is in on it. He hates Trump and is pissed he couldn&#039;t control the primaries. His son is a cunt as well, more of a pure globalist doesn&#039;t really lean right. I wouldn&#039;t be surprised if there was a major falling out between murdoch and fox news staff.

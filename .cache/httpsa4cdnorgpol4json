If you eat junk food shit only and are not able to make at least three pasta, three rice and three potato based meals you are part of the problem. <br><br>It is really easy, I&#039;d not say I&#039;m talented but I still don&#039;t even need recipes. Everybody can make a salad, some marinated chicken and rice. Everybody can make pasta, some tuna and onions \/ garlic. Everbody can make a simple potato casserole with ground meat and potatoes. <br><br>IT IS SIMPLE.<br><br>This stuff is so much healthier for you, won&#039;t make you as fat and you will get rid of your addiction for refined sugars. <br><br>Again: Don&#039;t even talk about resisting porn when you are still eating junk food. This shit is fucking up your life big time.<br><br>Also: Cooking has class and is a skill a good man should have. Keep women out of the kitchen. Cooking is a man&#039;s job (see: best chefs in the world are male).","filename":"37F9302400000578-0-image-a-2_1473167627389","ext":".jpg","w":636,"h":358,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":140,"tim":1493710021334,"time":1493710021,"md5":"ZX5y1PxD0t1Db4rXzTwxUQ==","fsize":37377,"resto":0,"id":"Fr8BaVRR","country":"DE","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"if-you-cant-cook-you-are-degenerate","country_name":"Germany","replies":12,"images":4,"omitted_posts":7,"omitted_images":1},{"no":123743309,"now":"05\/02\/17(Tue)03:49:48","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123743151\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123743151<\/a><br>Ok I had a genuine laugh from that.

Trump is boring now. After november I would put on my maga cap and play battle hymn of the republic. But now he is president and nothing interesting has happened. No swamp has been drained, it feels like nothing has changed and nothing will change. Instead of going against the previous kike-ass presidents he&#039;s gearing up to toe the line even harder. Liberal tears can only satisfy for so long. Who gives a shit about his international fucking politics? You voted for a guy to fix your country and he only whines about other countries and is threatening war everywhere. What happened to America first. I wanna know who shot JFK, I wanna read about all the insane things that DJT should be exposing<br><br>What is antifa even protesting? He could be secretly replaced with Bush Sr\/W or Bill Clinton and nobody would notice if they didn&#039;t see it with their eyes. The policies would be the same <br><br>It&#039;s just annoying because I always liked the guy. I watched the apprentice in 2004-2007. Wanted him to win and start some shit. But now look at this crap. It&#039;s just a fucking disappointment. I know faggots are gonna come in here and say &quot;8 year president&quot; (yeah right), and list some mundane things that he has done. Whatever. It&#039;s not resonating here or anywhere. Since the election it has been only passive aggressive warmongering and quarreling with people I&#039;ve never heard of. McBannon, Barron, Slicer, Scolio, Curry Ann Coalway, they come with a new name every week. <br><br>I sadly rate this presidency 4\/10 for comedic value. I really hope he can change my mind soon. Inb4 shill, just suck my cock, I&#039;ve probably been here longer than you are allowed on the internet.

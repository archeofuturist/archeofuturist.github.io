We were on the 72nd floor - essentially right below the &#039;strike&#039;. Yet the stairwells all the way down were bearable heat wise so I&#039;m not buying the &quot;The fire burned so hot it melted the steel beams&quot; notion at all. We were told that a incident took place in WTC I and we should stay put until further notice so the evacuation of that building isn&#039;t compromised. Shortly after we felt a severe shock that knocked me and others out of their chairs as well as cubicle walls. Many of us decided to nix the directive to stay put. We used the stairs and heard, consistent (timed) explosions all the way down to the ground floor. Once we hit the Concourse it was a complete disaster: the walls, which are made of 15&quot; solid marble, had huge sections blasted away laying on the floor... some of it looked pulverized and some was like a powder scattered all around. One of the service elevators near the PATH train entrance had its doors blasted outward! Those steel doors were shredded!! Outside was chaos and it was difficult to tell what was going on, where to go for help, etc. I decided to get as far as I could from the building. I got about 3 blocks away on Fulton St. when I heard a series of high pitched explosive sounds and a something that sounded like a steam train trying to gather momentum. I turned around and saw the building I just left coming down with a pillar of dust and debris as tall as a office building barreling down the street. All I could do was hit the street, cover my head and pray. I stood up covered in a fine, grey dust with huge slabs of steel and glass all over the place. Why I didn&#039;t get impaled or crushed...I had no idea at the time. I&#039;ve since understood why. Yet I&#039;ve also developed COPD -- not unlike most of the folks who came in contact with that &#039;dust&#039;.","filename":"WTC-plane-impact-clifton-08","ext":".jpg","w":640,"h":480,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":187,"tim":1490757997556,"time":1490757997,"md5":"apv7ViiEubHDG+R\/NQ7SeQ==","fsize":19008,"resto":0,"id":"+BOkHw0k","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"i-was-in-the-south-tower-aka-wtc-ii-the-2nd-of","country_name":"United States","replies":11,"images":2,"omitted_posts":6,"omitted_images":1},{"no":118745781,"now":"03\/29\/17(Wed)00:17:23","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118740649\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118740649<\/a><br>911 was obviously an inside job<br><br>https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=8DO<wbr>nAn_PX6M<br><br><br>nobody can deny this doc","time":1490761043,"resto":118740649,"id":"wIZ\/jZbp","country":"CA","country_name":"Canada"},{"no":118746649,"now":"03\/29\/17(Wed)00:26:35","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118740649\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118740649<\/a><br><br>Bless you friend, were gonna get these son of a bitches, were never stop investigating until we do.<br><br>Rip NYPD FDNY E-911 Responders and family\/friends","time":1490761595,"resto":118740649,"id":"6bV7BtWI","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":118746914,"now":"03\/29\/17(Wed)00:29:36","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118740649\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118740649<\/a><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Yet I&#039;ve also developed COPD<\/span><br><br>Yeah that&#039;s what I was thinking.

Many compounding pharmacies now offer liquid glutathione, and it\u2019s easy to find nebulizers at your local drug store. Glutathione is considered the most potent anti-oxidant our body produces. It\u2019s a string of three amino acids (glutamine cysteine, and glycine) made by every single cell in our bodies. Oxygen itself is an oxidant, and glutathione is the major complex that provides the balance between oxygen levels necessary for life, but not so much that our blood vessels \u201coxidize\u201d (kind of like rusting).<br>Glutathione is a superb detox agent and helps protect us against a myriad of irritants including pollution, poisons, drugs and heavy metals. It\u2019s important to always use the \u201creduced\u201d form of glutathione, also known as GSH. \u201cReduced\u201d has to do with a biochemical process called \u201credox.\u201d \u201cReduction\u201d in this context means attaching an electron to a \u201cradical\u201d molecule, which is missing an electron and desperately trying to become stable by \u201cgrabbing\u201d an electron. GSH neatly stabilizes this cascade of destruction and inflammation. Moreover, inhaling liquid GSH isn\u2019t the only way to benefit from this fantastic natural healing molecule \u2014 although that\u2019s probably the best delivery method for lung diseases. Because GSH is not very stable, some very innovative researchers have<br>been looking into ways of extending the useful shelf life of GSH for decades. Fairly recently there has been a breakthrough with liposomal technology.","time":1490762566,"resto":118740649,"id":"6bV7BtWI","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":118749431,"now":"03\/29\/17(Wed)00:57:45","name":"Anonymous","com":"Bump for great justice.","filename":"tmp_13976-14767372105431493131833","ext":".jpg","w":612,"h":612,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":125,"tim":1490763465381,"time":1490763465,"md5":"VRn0hh2Nn5uJXxB1HAdZXg==","fsize":57916,"resto":118740649,"id":"gOr5yF6t","country":"US","country_name":"United States"}]},{"posts":[{"no":118726754,"now":"03\/28\/17(Tue)21:16:22","name":"Anonymous","com":"Immigrants shouldn&#039;t have to pay over a grand per individual just to pass this racist test if she becomes PM. <br>When my family came here we had at most 150$, for the entire family.

Trump&#039;s response was the best play he could come up with given his current circumstances. It&#039;s not masterstroke worthy but it allows him to recover and make a bit of breathing room after being under constant attack by enemies foreign and domestic since day 1 of his presidency. The advance warning to Russia will temper their response somewhat. If Putin catches on, he&#039;ll publicly express outrage and threats while silently maintaining the status quo. Syria loses an airfield, but it&#039;s not a sustained bombing campaign to take out their entire air force or preventing Russia from assisting them. <br><br>The only thing we should get from this is that the globalists are more dangerous than ever and need to be eliminated fast. This was a callous move because the Russians would also be monitoring the operation and would prevent any chem shells from being used if they still existed. ISIS was tunneling into Syria green zones and was likely stockpiling sarin at potential bombing sites. Two main suspects as to where they got it from: CIA or Mossad. It&#039;s probably the same batches that Assad turned over to UN\/OPCW inspectors back in 2014. Wouldn&#039;t be surprised if Obama\/HRC loyalist elements appropriated a few shells and funneled them to their ISIS stooges with Israeli help. If Assad was smart, he&#039;d have his people scouring the site for chem barrels and mortal shell fragments to get serial\/batch numbers and make a formal request to audit the records of the batches allegedly destroyed by OPCW.

Noriega has been on the CIA\u2019s payroll since 1966, and has been transporting drugs with the CIA\u2019s knowledge since 1972. By the late 80s, Noriega\u2019s growing independence and intransigence have angered Washington\u2026 so out he goes.<br><br>Haiti: 1990 - Competing against 10 comparatively wealthy candidates, leftist priest Jean-Bertrand Aristide captures 68 percent of the vote. After only eight months in power, however, the CIA-backed military deposes him. More military dictators brutalize the country, as thousands of Haitian refugees escape the turmoil in barely seaworthy boats. As popular opinion calls for Aristide\u2019s return, the CIA begins a disinformation campaign painting the courageous priest as mentally unstable.<br><br>The Gulf War: 1991 - The U.S. liberates Kuwait from Iraq. But Iraq\u2019s dictator, Saddam Hussein, is another creature of the CIA. With U.S. encouragement, Hussein invaded Iran in 1980. During this costly eight-year war, the CIA built up Hussein\u2019s forces with sophisticated arms, intelligence, training and financial backing. This cemented Hussein\u2019s power at home, allowing him to crush the many internal rebellions that erupted from time to time, sometimes with poison gas. It also gave him all the military might he needed to conduct further adventurism \u2014 in Kuwait, for example.<br><br>Haiti: 1993 - The chaos in Haiti grows so bad that President Clinton has no choice but to remove the Haitian military dictator, Raoul Cedras, on threat of U.S. invasion. The U.S. occupiers do not arrest Haiti\u2019s military leaders for crimes against humanity, but instead ensure their safety and rich retirements.

You could make a compelling argument that atheism is specifically being pushed by Jews in today&#039;s society, and they seem to largely be targeting western Christians and only them.<br><br>For example, Sam Harris, Chapman Cohen, David Silverman, Michael Newdow, Gregory Epstein, Sherman Wine, Bill Maher, Eric Kaufmann, and of course, Richard Dawkins&#039;s mother has a Jewish surname and was stated to have lived in the only Jewish suburb of the city she grew up in. But he hasn&#039;t explicitly named her religion.<br><br>But that&#039;s only a tiny part of the list. We could discuss the Jewish atheists who aren&#039;t pushing atheism so much as atheism-enabling political views like Marxism. For example Soklonikov, Trotsky, Deutscher, Lenin, Uritsky, Kamenev, Zinoviev and Sverdlov.<br><br>And what about atheist Jewish public entertainers that constantly run down Christianity? We can go ahead and recycle Bill Maher here and also include Jon Leibowitz, Stephen Fry, Woody Allen, Rob Reiner, Daniel Radcliffe, Larry David, David Silverman, and...

There is clearly a curse associated with people who try to Mossad the Assad.<br><br>Literally all the prominent intellectuals who used to support Klumpf and helped him win the election like Stefan Molyneux and also Jared Taylor have repudiated Klumpf, and no longer want him to have access to the nuclear codes.<br><br>I&#039;m telling you man, Klumpflets are delusional if they think they can keep the nuclear codes.

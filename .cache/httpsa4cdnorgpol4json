You must be successful, reliable, hardworking, and, above all, happy. Do people in your life trust and respect you? What does your family think of you? Are you capable of raising children? Racial politics doesn\u2019t have to be the only factor of your life. And if you can&#039;t achieve these things in your real life, then you are not ready to be a political activist, either online or in real life. Because if you can&#039;t make anything of your own, individual life, then how can you think you&#039;ll be able to make a real difference for the race, for the lives of many?<br><br>Always remember: we live in first world countries and have opportunity that most people born on this planet don&#039;t. Take care of yourself. Work your ass off, every day, to build a good life for you, and for your family. Spend your time wisely, and keep your real life priorities in order. Nothing on the internet should ever take away from your real life.","filename":"1486165918022","ext":".jpg","w":1024,"h":1024,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":250,"tim":1492695815497,"time":1492695815,"md5":"FzwJv17\/wjHci7tIbrJNjA==","fsize":168680,"resto":0,"id":"tlfNQdbP","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"the-most-important-thing-you-can-do-for-the-white","country_name":"United States","replies":0,"images":0}]},{"posts":[{"no":121987084,"now":"04\/20\/17(Thu)07:55:09","name":"Anonymous","sub":"Antifa gets Bix Nood&#039;d","com":"The modern left can&#039;t attribute any wrongdoing to minorities because in their narrative they are inherently virtuous by being the ones oppressed, so the same way that old school communist leaders romanticized the blue collar worker, antifa finds itself imagining that all minorities will share their conception of self interest and rise with them and bring down the &quot;white supremacist system&quot;.<br><br>Knowing this it makes it so much more satisfying when you see an antifa fag be confronted by a nigger ready to chimp out, just look at the confusion in his face, he knows that this ape made no sense but he can&#039;t bring himself to admit that, he just stares quietly since antagonizing a black man would be racist, even when the nigger is clearly looking for a fight.<br><br>If this is what the militant left i today, is there any doubt that we will win?","filename":"Dank black man","ext":".png","w":1097,"h":725,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":165,"tim":1492689309490,"time":1492689309,"md5":"S8XHY4nNeRoKpXv0mKZPMA==","fsize":790760,"resto":0,"id":"CpA+BkXB","country":"DK","m_img":1,"bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"antifa-gets-bix-noodd","country_name":"Denmark","replies":66,"images":7,"omitted_posts":61,"omitted_images":6},{"no":121994900,"now":"04\/20\/17(Thu)09:34:24","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121994631\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121994631<\/a><br>t.antifa member that got cucked by big black man","time":1492695264,"resto":121987084,"id":"lXYSik2S","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":121994908,"now":"04\/20\/17(Thu)09:34:33","name":"Anonymous","com":"I love that this fag fancies himself Lenin but can&#039;t command enough authority with his meek physique for anyone to defend hm while he is publicly mocked.<br><br>https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=CKx<wbr>XbD2Jbyg","filename":"carrot","ext":".jpg","w":1200,"h":675,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":70,"tim":1492695273207,"time":1492695273,"md5":"dQhYSA6EA3nN8L036zNBGQ==","fsize":128153,"resto":121987084,"id":"CpA+BkXB","country":"DK","m_img":1,"country_name":"Denmark"},{"no":121994956,"now":"04\/20\/17(Thu)09:35:02","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121994631\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121994631<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;If you confront your enemies they win<\/span>","time":1492695302,"resto":121987084,"id":"P6UIYsal","country":"ES","country_name":"Spain"},{"no":121995367,"now":"04\/20\/17(Thu)09:40:11","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121989896\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121989896<\/a><br>Please PLEASE blackanons just say it in English, we don&#039;t have time for this shit.

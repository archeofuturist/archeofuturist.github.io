I was surrounded by 2 black males and a pacific islander ages 16-18.<br><br>This black kid wearing a red hoodie pulled out a gun and pointed it about 5 inches away from my face saying &quot;give me everything wallet keys everything, phone give me your phone&quot;.<br><br>I gave them everything and ran into the store. While I was running I was afraid they might shoot me in my back.<br><br>Cops were called and showed up 1 minute later. They caught on guy and the other two are on camera running away. The also went into a grocery store bathroom next door and were caught on camera there too.<br><br>Apparently one already confessed, I heard it over police radio. My car is fucked from fingerprint dusting. Brand new car too. <br><br>I hope this isnt too off topic but I figured I would let you guys know. You try to not be racist in real life but fuck me its going to be hard to not be from now on.

By simulating an alliance with Putin, he brought to the leftists\u2019 attention the damage Russian meddling in Western affairs has had the potential to cause since we entered the age of social media. This made the staunchest of SJWs begin shifting their view of Russia towards seeing it, instead of the US, as the bastion of evil (a portrayal of the US the Russians have been pushing since the USSR\u2019s \u2018collapse\u2019). <br><br>Alinsky and Ayers, along with other infiltrators of the American government and academia have been instrumental in the slow decay of the Western way of life in this nation. Deception and subversion, not direct violence and confrontation, are how the Soviets decided to bring us down. They use pawns to conduct violence for them. Lee Harvey Oswald defected to the Soviets before killing JFK, giving them information on American planes while he was stationed in Japan before that. Despite his trips to Mexico in the days leading up to the assassination, the investigative commission rushed to close the case in order to avoid another crisis very soon after the Cuban Missile Crisis took place. Why would Russia risk it, and why would the US not pursue these terrorists?","filename":"9707e5ddd558ba1076ad5f95932dc5e5","ext":".jpg","w":736,"h":536,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":91,"tim":1491607772780,"time":1491607772,"md5":"173WxzJQnH2\/nf13StyBrA==","fsize":73641,"resto":120045856,"id":"g0O7VPhp","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":120045981,"now":"04\/07\/17(Fri)19:29:56","name":"Anonymous","com":"The answer lies in the root of Marxism: godlessness. Christmemes aside, understanding the ideological root of Russia\u2019s actions is crucial to understanding and projecting their future moves. Marxism, by its nature, is godless. Once man kills God, he believes he can be god himself. He tries to plan the society and the economy, to replace God\u2019s role in organising it (call it God or complex adaptability, the essence is the same). This fails miserably, bringing about destruction, poverty and moral decay. Once the pillars of a functional society (private property, family and nation) are forcefully removed, morals are gone. This is why the Soviets didn\u2019t mind a nuclear war, and this is why they used their own citizens to test biological and chemical weapons. The societal pillars are long gone from Russia.<br><br>On the topic of weapons of mass destruction, Soviet disregard for the Agreements signed with the West is truly appalling, even unbelievable to the average American. This was elaborately detailed by Kenneth Alibekov, a defector to the US who used to run Biopreparat, Russia\u2019s largest biological weapons producer during the Cold War. They had produced 20 tons of anthrax, as well as stockpiles of the Marburg Virus and smallpox. They also created rockets capable of delivering these agents to the US successfully. When American investigators went to the Soviet Union, they seemed bored and more interested in sightseeing - this seemed weird to Alibekov, but the Americans truly didn\u2019t believe Russians had violated the conventions they\u2019d signed. This further shows how naive the West was - and is - about the Soviets\u2019 true intentions.","filename":"maxresdefault","ext":".jpg","w":1280,"h":720,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":70,"tim":1491607796027,"time":1491607796,"md5":"nlezw1lVVNg9\/LnbDupdVQ==","fsize":74644,"resto":120045856,"id":"g0O7VPhp","country":"US","m_img":1,"country_name":"United States"}]},{"posts":[{"no":120037919,"now":"04\/07\/17(Fri)18:38:31","name":"Anonymous","sub":"Why is it okay for Assad to kill children?","filename":"1491589542277","ext":".jpg","w":634,"h":476,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":187,"tim":1491604711820,"time":1491604711,"md5":"U4SbxGsqQTd9q3W1vg9CmA==","fsize":50535,"resto":0,"id":"zS4CAtHB","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"why-is-it-okay-for-assad-to-kill-children","country_name":"United States","replies":56,"images":15,"omitted_posts":51,"omitted_images":15},{"no":120044535,"now":"04\/07\/17(Fri)19:20:14","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120040624\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120040624<\/a><br><br>We don&#039;t.","time":1491607214,"resto":120037919,"id":"YZWmVNxI","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":120044739,"now":"04\/07\/17(Fri)19:21:39","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120037919\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120037919<\/a><br>Why is it okay for America to start a war which will destroy a country and kill thousands more?","time":1491607299,"resto":120037919,"id":"JbNDzqLr","country":"IE","country_name":"Ireland"},{"no":120044832,"now":"04\/07\/17(Fri)19:22:12","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120038117\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120038117<\/a><br>Your pasta is shit","filename":"IMG_0622","ext":".jpg","w":526,"h":560,"tn_w":117,"tn_h":125,"tim":1491607332832,"time":1491607332,"md5":"f75xg9UlSzPFNytseHdyZg==","fsize":77963,"resto":120037919,"id":"lgymBhOp","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":120045698,"now":"04\/07\/17(Fri)19:27:56","name":"Anonymous","com":"It&#039;s okay when Trump does it.","filename":"Screenshot_2017-04-07_19-27-26","ext":".png","w":920,"h":687,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":93,"tim":1491607676556,"time":1491607676,"md5":"UK1lN\/glkOnDugtO05SSlA==","fsize":639239,"resto":120037919,"id":"Cmeq6u4g","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":120045855,"now":"04\/07\/17(Fri)19:28:58","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120045698\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120045698<\/a><br>Good riddance","time":1491607738,"resto":120037919,"id":"TF2vTnqs","country":"CA","country_name":"Canada"}]},{"posts":[{"no":120045854,"now":"04\/07\/17(Fri)19:28:57","name":"Anonymous","sub":"Trump will face war crimes charges","com":"<span class=\"quote\">&gt;Putin and Assad organize to gas people so that America can make a pointless attack<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Russia had anti-air defense systems in place, could have taken down cruise missiles<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;minimal damage to runway, planes still reported to be taking off<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Trump gets praise from both parties, and leaders of other countries<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;#russiagate bumped off the news<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;#russiagate is damaged because alt-right, shills, and even normies can ask how could Trump and Putin be working together if Russia is so mad<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Russia gets to rave about how bad America is and posture<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Russia uses it as an excuse to move more forces into the middle east<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;rebels were killed so Assad and Russia still win<\/span><br><br><br>America is complicit in the use of chemical weapons against human beings.

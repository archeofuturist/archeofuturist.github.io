This will put an end to his long-term political ambitions.<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;According to The Moscow Times\u2019 sources, Vladimir Putin will most likely announce his presidential bid next fall.

Putin will have to pick someone from one of two categories, says Pavlovsky: either a prime minister \u201cfor the elite,\u201d or a prime minister \u201cfor the nation.\u201d In the Russian context, these are fundamentally opposite political directions. The former would mean relying on a liberal-minded politician close to economic circles, but with little popularity among the masses. The latter would be a well-known \u201csilovik,\u201d a representative of the military or national security establishment.<\/span><br><br>This means Navalny actually won.

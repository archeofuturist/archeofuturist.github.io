is Trump &quot;saving&quot; coal?","com":"I was raised in a small town in Virginia where your daddy was usually a coal miner and your momma was usually a teacher and your job prospects outside of that were few and far between. When I was 16 I was expected to help with some &quot;light duty&quot; at the mines to become familiar and at 18 I was dragged off into the mines themselves. You&#039;re talking about some scary shit.<br><br>To my family&#039;s chagrin, I escaped. I taught myself web development and I did that on the side until I got hired by a place in Tennessee, then eventually one in Georgia, and I&#039;ve been down here ever since.<br><br>Coal is dead. What they&#039;re scraping out of those mines to make ends meet is killing these men. Look it up. Complex black lung in men as young as their 30s. There&#039;s been a steep rise over the last 15 years. They can&#039;t even figure it out. It&#039;s taking these men down and putting them into a life of nebulizers and breathing treatments multiple times a day, or ultimately to a double lung transplant. And who&#039;s gonna pay for that? Not a coal miner.<br><br>Meanwhile, the power plants we were selling that coal to are gone. You know why? Cause their plants are old. Coal plants are complex as hell to operate and they need a lot of physical real-estate to operate, not to mention the environmental risks of storing coal ash. You don&#039;t even want to know what happens when that shit spills. Look it up if you love post-apocalyptic scenarios.<br><br>When coal plants get old, they replace them with natural gas plants. Or they retire them entirely and increase output from the neighboring nuclear, hydro, natural gas, whatever. Hardly anyone rebuilds coal plants anymore.<br><br>So who&#039;s gonna buy the coal? How can you save something nobody wants? Natural gas is cheap, requires a smaller plant to produce power, and is easier to transport because you get more energy per square inch.<br><br>Coal is dead. Saving coal is a meme. Scraping these mines bare is killing people. Enough already.","filename":"012013_courtesy3","ext":".jpg","w":2100,"h":1400,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":166,"tim":1491359296533,"time":1491359296,"md5":"UuOIccZzMIGdns\/UTNBLcQ==","fsize":599740,"resto":0,"id":"3SRKvDPR","country":"US","m_img":1,"bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"why-is-trump-saving-coal","country_name":"United States","replies":43,"images":5,"omitted_posts":38,"omitted_images":3},{"no":119567274,"now":"04\/05\/17(Wed)00:35:14","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119553726\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119553726<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;To my family&#039;s chagrin, I escaped<\/span><br>bootyblasted homoqueer detected","time":1491366914,"resto":119553726,"id":"xPp0DXqy","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":119567323,"now":"04\/05\/17(Wed)00:35:40","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119553726\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119553726<\/a><br>My entire plant runs on coal boilers. <br>Fuck off numale cuck.<br><br>You&#039;re the type of scumbag that says commie shit like &quot;wetbacks do jobs Americans wont&quot;.

They change names, subvert traditions: all the while remaining nameless. The consequences of the association with the Jew has been catastrophic, as the result of their subversion can be observed today. From Marx (and his mentor Moses Hess, fellow Jew) to Freud, Bronstein to Rothstein, the Jews have been known to push for specific agendas that have a similar theme: avoid anti-Semitism. Which is fine (for groups to maintain loyalty to their own), but it is at the expense of others.<\/span><br><br>I agree, anon. Clearly, not every Jew is on the same page, but as a group, they are ultimately a deleterious force. Their interests are often at odds with the people of the nation they&#039;re currently inhabiting, a rootless cancer, as it were. I suppose the only reason Jews are beloved in my country is because of a specific brand of servile Protestantism which worships Jews and Israel. <br>https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=s6S<wbr>tVNfcttc<br><br><a href=\"#p119567221\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119567221<\/a><br>What&#039;s your endgame here, faggot?","filename":"1466158070439","ext":".jpg","w":306,"h":410,"tn_w":93,"tn_h":125,"tim":1491367196871,"time":1491367196,"md5":"xVhZG3kEboEozB0gA\/uOBg==","fsize":41003,"resto":119516282,"id":"6Dkq+P83","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":119567942,"now":"04\/05\/17(Wed)00:42:27","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119567732\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119567732<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;What&#039;s your endgame here, faggot?<\/span><br>Just exchanging friendly banter with our little jewish friend here.

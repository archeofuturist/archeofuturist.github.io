You need to pick a central belief element to get the energy flowing through. In areas of high ethnic uniformity ethnic nationalism is a fine choice, it gets all the people working together for the same goal, driven by their zeal.<br><br>America however already has a very strong civic nationalist tradition. The constitution is a pseudo-religious document to many, and flat out considered divinely inspired by some. America already has the strong foundations for civic nationalism, you just nudge patriotism a little harder and you are already there.<br><br>Further we can easily use civic nationalism to shut down many of the lefts arguments. Any citizen is welcome, anyone who believes in america is welcome. We can simultaneously use this to get rid of people who hate america and our values, even those who are technically citizens.<br><br>Civic nationalism is the right fit for america, and possibly the new world in general.<br><br>I do hope you understand that even ethnic nationalism is about motivation and positivity. The nazis wanted everyone else to take pride in their races too. The idea was always that you can better yourself by believing you are better, and striving to prove it. There are nazis on record explaining this. Nationalism is about finding a common ground with the people around you and bootstrapping yourself into being fucking awesome through your own willpower. Its meme magic, not being a stupid racist.","time":1490340416,"resto":118054399,"id":"JQlelFmX","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":118056335,"now":"03\/24\/17(Fri)03:28:13","name":"Anonymous","com":"Example here.

My current gf says she was terrified of me when she saw me get dropped off in college by a lowrider full of my bald headed gangster cousins, but that she was turned on by how intimidating I look. Women are just attracted to scumbags, I was once, and would still be one if it was not for me joining the Army, but most of the offspring of the badboys, thugs and other violent douchebags women like to fuck are going to join the military and change their lives. They are going to be out there committing crimes and hurting others, and their moms who decided to get pregnant by their piece of shit dads are the only ones to blame. We could fix minority communities in one generation, if women stopped fucking these men","time":1490340063,"resto":118036473,"id":"euCy01Aa","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":118055913,"now":"03\/24\/17(Fri)03:21:39","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118055837\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118055837<\/a>","filename":"winnipeg bar","ext":".webm","w":700,"h":394,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":70,"tim":1490340099318,"time":1490340099,"md5":"TX3BFBMoGYBiKq2RSX5Euw==","fsize":2051224,"resto":118036473,"id":"nZgPafXK","country":"CA","country_name":"Canada"},{"no":118056244,"now":"03\/24\/17(Fri)03:27:01","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118055851\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118055851<\/a><br>Of course no sex before marriage is something I believe to enforce","time":1490340421,"resto":118036473,"id":"nZgPafXK","country":"CA","country_name":"Canada"}]},{"posts":[{"no":118051795,"now":"03\/24\/17(Fri)02:27:18","name":"Anonymous","com":"Anyone who has ever condoned Islam in the UK is guilty of treason under the Queen&#039;s law.<br>Everyone on every level from any prime minister to ignore the matter down to any immigration official who checked a Muslim into our state is a fucking treasoner.<br><br>Anyone in the UK who practices Islam is guilty of conspiracy to commit treason.<br><br>Both of these crimes are punishable by death penalty.<br><br>The land must be cleansed of traitors and infiltrators alike.<br><br>Do not ignore the call to arms when the time comes.","filename":"knights_crusades","ext":".jpg","w":318,"h":318,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":250,"tim":1490336838602,"time":1490336838,"md5":"TYKM\/3FTz0\/9chZjaN79lA==","fsize":15698,"resto":0,"id":"oTTDxk0m","country":"JP","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"anyone-who-has-ever-condoned-islam-in-the-uk-is","country_name":"Japan","replies":9,"images":0,"omitted_posts":4,"omitted_images":0},{"no":118054276,"now":"03\/24\/17(Fri)02:57:55","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118053353\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118053353<\/a><br>It&#039;s like you don&#039;t even browse \/pol\/ ironically.","time":1490338675,"resto":118051795,"id":"MlVN1JHf","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":118054348,"now":"03\/24\/17(Fri)02:58:53","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118052837\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118052837<\/a><br>We must strike the infiltrators first.<br><br>The police and military are guarding the traitors.<br><br>We will need a serious show of force to acquire the cooperation of police and military personnel. <br><br>This is why every man must show his face when the cleansing starts.","time":1490338733,"resto":118051795,"id":"oTTDxk0m","country":"JP","country_name":"Japan"},{"no":118054561,"now":"03\/24\/17(Fri)03:01:41","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118054101\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118054101<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;weeb<\/span><br>I detest all modern Japanese &quot;culture&quot;<br>cept&#039; the cars and bikes. can&#039;t go wrong with a rice rocket.","time":1490338901,"resto":118051795,"id":"oTTDxk0m","country":"JP","country_name":"Japan"},{"no":118056170,"now":"03\/24\/17(Fri)03:25:41","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118054348\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118054348<\/a><br><br>I think killing the traitors will send a message to infiltrators that they have no future here.

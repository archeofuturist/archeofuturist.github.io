Because if you can&#039;t make anything of your own, individual life, then how can you think you&#039;ll be able to make a difference for the race, for the lives of many? Spend your time wisely, and keep your real life priorities in order. Nothing on the internet should ever take away from your real life. Your time on Earth is short and precious. Start planning on making the most of it.","filename":"1458864720349","ext":".jpg","w":1920,"h":1080,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":140,"tim":1491631838412,"time":1491631838,"md5":"Dqz6gWnn98RlTZ6OmWAJfA==","fsize":251930,"resto":0,"id":"xLxsBrmL","country":"US","m_img":1,"bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"the-most-important-thing-you-can-do-for-the-white","country_name":"United States","replies":3,"images":0},{"no":120099617,"now":"04\/08\/17(Sat)02:37:34","name":"Anonymous","com":"Yes","time":1491633454,"resto":120097019,"id":"BZ+sEQIX","country":"SE","country_name":"Sweden"},{"no":120100030,"now":"04\/08\/17(Sat)02:42:18","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120097019\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120097019<\/a><br>And blast some niggers!","time":1491633738,"resto":120097019,"id":"roMjz9dl","country":"ES","country_name":"Spain"},{"no":120100148,"now":"04\/08\/17(Sat)02:43:34","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120097019\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120097019<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;implies the shitty usa is 1st world <\/span><br>FUCKING KEK","time":1491633814,"resto":120097019,"id":"dVdXiblF","country":"FI","country_name":"Finland"}]},{"posts":[{"no":120093976,"now":"04\/08\/17(Sat)01:41:41","name":"Anonymous","sub":"HAPPENING","com":"TEXAS ANONS GET THE FUCK IN HERE WE GOT A MAJOR HAPPENING<br><br>SIRENS GOING OFF ALL OVER THE PLACE<br><br>https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=Hu8<wbr>HFHgiWpA","filename":"doompaul2","ext":".jpg","w":479,"h":328,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":171,"tim":1491630101921,"time":1491630101,"md5":"R4P3SpDTFEO+zPQL9kQoMw==","fsize":30812,"resto":0,"id":"CTKcyO69","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"happening","country_name":"United States","replies":206,"images":84,"omitted_posts":201,"omitted_images":82,"tail_size":50},{"no":120100081,"now":"04\/08\/17(Sat)02:42:47","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120099400\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120099400<\/a>","filename":"1362681302352","ext":".jpg","w":1024,"h":713,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":87,"tim":1491633767913,"time":1491633767,"md5":"tENvidBRRELxIZex5fAwRw==","fsize":101631,"resto":120093976,"id":"W8N87qQg","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":120100100,"now":"04\/08\/17(Sat)02:43:04","name":"Anonymous","com":"here we go.............<br>all the way down........","filename":"b64","ext":".jpg","w":717,"h":789,"tn_w":113,"tn_h":125,"tim":1491633784562,"time":1491633784,"md5":"qpG+uvGFOLSNNoLaS0NvZw==","fsize":174062,"resto":120093976,"id":"zHwHZEvR","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":120100107,"now":"04\/08\/17(Sat)02:43:06","name":"Anonymous","com":"just saw a flash streak across the sky in Garland","time":1491633786,"resto":120093976,"id":"DToxk0jB","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":120100141,"now":"04\/08\/17(Sat)02:43:31","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120094777\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120094777<\/a><br>OHHHH FUUUGG WHAT HAVE WE DONE","filename":"IMG_0065","ext":".jpg","w":1024,"h":983,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":119,"tim":1491633811974,"time":1491633811,"md5":"WZ6N09ufm5hLflaBPQaY5g==","fsize":98416,"resto":120093976,"id":"hOUzU9Ko","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":120100146,"now":"04\/08\/17(Sat)02:43:34","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120099486\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120099486<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;&gt;No sources on what exactly is malfunctioning<\/span><br>the &quot;off&quot; switch","filename":"1362680671329","ext":".jpg","w":666,"h":666,"tn_w":124,"tn_h":124,"tim":1491633814477,"time":1491633814,"md5":"w63\/+dwtqKWWkFNWk9vYFw==","fsize":49448,"resto":120093976,"id":"W8N87qQg","country":"US","country_name":"United States"}]},{"posts":[{"no":120091584,"now":"04\/08\/17(Sat)01:19:32","name":"Anonymous","sub":"Can someone explain why alot of people on \/pol\/ are now against trump?","com":"I dont like him either but I thought all of you guys were pro trump?

They are very easy to spot. They also tend to be anti \/r\/the_donald in order to cause a civil war among our fellow brothers and sisters who have managed to maintain a stronghold on Reddit. Most of \/r\/the_donald are \/pol\/ crossposters so any anti \/r\/the_donald post is an affront at \/pol\/, shills are capitalizing on 4chan&#039;s hatred of reddit to divide us.<br><br>2) Pro-Assad\/pro-Putin shills - any time you see a pro-Assad post there is a 80-85% chance you are speaking from a paid shill from the Kremlin. Studies show that most of the posters from \/sg\/ are from IPs that originate from Moscow, they have been part of \/pol\/ for a while now but lately the Russian government has increased their paychecks so you are seeing a lot more pro-Assad + pro-Putin propaganda posted on here. Be very wary. The remaining 15-20% are just misinformed posters who have fallen for Sputnik\/RT propaganda, so they can be redeemed.<br><br>Last point I want to make is that we are in very chaotic times, shills must understand that \/pol\/ will always stand by Donald J.Trump. No amount of concern trolling will EVER change this.","filename":"Screen-Shot-2016-05-26-at-1.21.42-PM","ext":".png","w":387,"h":469,"tn_w":206,"tn_h":250,"tim":1491625710351,"time":1491625710,"md5":"uGREGtKTlNWxY4P\/XiJnXA==","fsize":378414,"resto":0,"id":"HP5llGxn","country":"AU","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"how-to-spot-shills","country_name":"Australia","replies":74,"images":19,"omitted_posts":69,"omitted_images":18},{"no":120099010,"now":"04\/08\/17(Sat)02:30:56","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120085936\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120085936<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;\/pol\/ will always stand by Donald J.Trump<\/span><br>Can you fuck off?

My grandfather was one of the chief military figures in developing the neutron bomb in the 50s and early 60s. He went to graduate school for nuclear physics, and they put him on as the military officer in charge of the project (I think we was either a Lt. Colonel or a full Colonel at the time, strangely enough as an armored officer). His team basically brought Cohen&#039;s theories to life as the first generation of high radiation\/low yield thermonuclear devices. Basically, neutron bombs are useful because we can&#039;t just drop a hydrogen bomb on all of our problems. Sometimes you want to go nuclear to show your serious without going top shelf with a 10 megaton device. The neutron bomb solves this by lacking the tamper (usually made of non-reactive U-238) the regular hydrogen bomb does (obviously with other alterations I don&#039;t know about because I&#039;m not a nuclear physics\/don&#039;t have Q clearance with the DOE or TS\/SCI with the DoD). The tamper reflects neutrons back into the reaction of a thermonuclear device causing the reaction to complete more, which means more energy -&gt; a bigger explosion. Without a tamper, the reaction doesn&#039;t reach completion before being blown apart by the energy created, so radioactive isotopes are blown all over the fucking place. Basically, a neutron bomb is kind of like if a dirty bomb fucked a hydrogen bomb and they had a baby.","time":1491633707,"resto":120085936,"id":"STm7Q0l9","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":120100094,"now":"04\/08\/17(Sat)02:42:59","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120099969\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120099969<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;<a href=\"\/pol\/thread\/120099730#p120099999\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120099999<\/a><\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;<a href=\"\/pol\/thread\/120099145#p120100000\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120100000<\/a><\/span>","time":1491633779,"resto":120085936,"id":"4XSZagWC","country":"US","country_name":"United States"}]},{"posts":[{"no":120098003,"now":"04\/08\/17(Sat)02:20:55","name":"Anonymous","com":"Trump is a fucking pussy.

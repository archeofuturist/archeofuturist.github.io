I have no real meaning in life other than a mission of self improvement that I&#039;ve started recently.<br>I wish the entire world was Christian, it seems to be the religion I relate to the most on a moral and philosophical level, but how does anybody believe in God nowadays with ZERO evidence? I&#039;d give anything just to have some divine revelation that God is real, or for God to speak to me personally, etc., just so I could believe, but there is so much shit in the bible that simply isn&#039;t true (Earth resting on pillars and shit like that).<br>How do I do it, \/pol\/?

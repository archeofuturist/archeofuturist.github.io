Japanese games almost ALWAYS have white characters, and no asians. The protagonists are almost never asian in appearance, even though the creators of the game are Japanese. Tons of blonde people in their games. Why is this? Is there a &quot;white&quot; obsession in Japan? And the list goes on and on.....<br><br>Mario, Princess Peach<br><br>Link (he is an elf or something, but still looks white, Zelda is certainly white)<br><br>Samus<br><br>MANY of the Final Fantasy Characters== total white boys<br><br>Solid Snake (I know, he is half Japanese, half American or somethiing, but he looks white), almost all the other MGS characters are white<br><br>Devil May Cry dude<br><br>Almost ALL of the Resident Evil Characters (in fact, most Capcom games are full of whites)<br><br>Castlevania dudes<br><br>Many many more that I am not thinking about right now......<br><br>Seriously, other than a couple JRPG characters, the Street Fighter folks, and Ryu Hyabusa, I am having trouble coming up with Japanese protagonists in Japanese games.","filename":"Regional_5ba63c_1417056","ext":".jpg","w":600,"h":970,"tn_w":154,"tn_h":249,"tim":1491262206822,"time":1491262206,"md5":"pkDHZgEHrqT1Q41o9tQHJg==","fsize":162836,"resto":0,"id":"s9MoZiEa","country":"AT","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"it-really-doesnt-make-sense-to-me-japanese-games","country_name":"Austria","replies":4,"images":2},{"no":119398117,"now":"04\/03\/17(Mon)19:31:53","name":"Anonymous","com":"White people are the most beautiful race.
